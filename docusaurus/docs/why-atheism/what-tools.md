# What Tools Can We Use?

How can we examine these claims?  What tools can we use to determine truth of external reality?  We have (1) empirical, verifiable evidence; and we have (2) logic.  Evidence and logic are the best tools we have to determine how the universe really works.  These tools have been extraordinarily successful in science, engineering and medicine, and in our daily lives.  This is the standard that most of us expect in dealing with the real world; we expect doctors to use the latest medicine, and engineers to use empirical data when building bridges.  Why should we use anything else for examining external reality?

When people believe things without evidence, they are left with no way to accurately judge whether or not what they believe reflects how things really are.  Their beliefs must then be based on feelings and emotion or the unquestioned authority of something or somebody else, not evidence.  I think that this is the reason for much of the emotional response to atheism.  For many, the idea of atheism challenges their deeply-held beliefs and emotions.  This can be painful, and can elicit a strong reaction.

Each of us can choose between a magical view of the universe (one or more invisible, immaterial gods did it), or the “what you see is what you get” scientific version.  I think that science, using empirical evidence and rational logic, has done a far better job in explaining how the universe works.

Thinking is hard, and scientific thinking is hardest; it often leads to unpleasant conclusions with little emotional payoff.  Dramatic religious story-telling that supports wishful thinking is usually easier, more interesting, and much more emotionally fulfilling.

At the center of science is intellectual honesty.  In order for ideas to be accepted in science, they must be supported by sufficient evidence and arguments.  Anybody can change what is accepted in science, if they can put forth evidence and arguments sufficient to show that their new idea is better.  In fact, the larger the change created by an individual, the more that individual is honored.  This is why Galileo, Newton, Darwin and Einstein are honored — because their ideas radically changed our views of the universe.  With this process of change, science can grow and improve our understanding of the universe.  Conversely, most religions are stuck with unchanging “holy” words from a book or founder.
