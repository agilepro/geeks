# Why God(s)?  Why Not?

The idea of an all-controlling, caring supernatural god is a very attractive one.  It can make our mortal lives seem less frightening, more comforting.  Somebody’s in control and won’t let bad things happen to us.  Many gods also promise that we can go to Heaven after we die, to live forever in some sort of bliss.

The idea of a god is also an easy answer to questions about the world around us.  It satisfies a need that many people have where they would rather be certain than right.  Where did the universe come from?  A god created it.  Where did life come from?  A god created it, too.  Where did humans come from?  A god created us, and in his own image, to boot.

For almost all believers, it's not just “a god” that they believe in.  They believe in a particular god or set of gods.

Religious philosophers have tried for thousands of years to prove that there is a god or many gods.  They have come up with many arguments.  We will look at these arguments.  Because I live in a largely Judeo-Christian society, when I refer to God with a capital ‘G’ I will be referring to the Judeo-Christian god Yahweh (a.k.a. Jehovah) and probably the Muslim god Allah.  This god is male and is typically defined as having free will, and being omniscient (all-knowing), omnipotent (all-powerful), omnibenevolent (all-good), perfect, eternal, and unchanging.  This god also created the universe and is separate from the physical world while still intervening in the physical world.  After all, what good is a god that doesn’t do anything?  Most of the arguments I use here will also apply to most of the other thousands of gods created by humankind, and most of the thousands of religions.  I certainly don’t know all of them, so I will deal with most of the major religions and their god(s).  I will also closely link god(s) and religion.  I do this advisedly because, for most people, one could not exist without the other.  In addition, if there were a god I would think that this god would be able to appropriately guide the religions created for it.

There is at least one religion, essential Buddhism as thought to have been taught by Buddha, which does not have a god or any supernatural component.  To keep things a bit simpler here, the arguments I make regarding religion will probably not apply to this Buddhism or any other religion without a supernatural component.  However, almost all religions have grown from belief in god(s) and people's narcissistic wish to believe that the universe was created just for their benefit.

We need to define “atheist” and “atheism.”  A theist is a person who believes in a god or gods.  The Greek prefix “a-” means without; thus an atheist is without belief and doesn't believe in any gods — and atheism is just the lack of belief in any gods.  Atheists can simply say that the existence of any god hasn't been reliably proven.  For many, atheism is also the conclusion that no gods exist, based on the complete lack of reliable evidence for any god.  I take the strong atheist position — depending on how we define “God” we can prove that it does not exist, and I will use the typical definition just given for the Christian god Yahweh.

Why am I doing this?  Is it just because I want to poke holes in people’s beliefs so that we can take away what makes them happy?  No, I’m doing this because I want to know what is true, be intellectually honest, and be open to reality.  And, I hope that you have similar reasons.

This article is an argument in support of reason, rationality, intellectual honesty, and truth.  We must know the truth to act wisely, and truth comes from physical reality.  I put forth many of the reasons why atheism is true — based on physical reality — so they can be examined and evaluated.  I also show why atheism and the philosophical extension Humanism are important to the future of humankind.

The arguments for the existence of god(s) fall into several areas.  I have arranged them into these categories:

* Mysticism and Revelation
* “Scientific” Claims
* Love and Morality
* Appeals to Authority
* Prophecies and Miracles
* Appeals to Faith, Logic, and Emotion
