# History of Naturalism

## Early Development of Science and Scientific Naturalism

Let’s start with a quick experiment.  You can grab three coins and actually do the experiment, or just do a thought experiment.

Drop one coin and watch it fall.  Do this again.  Hold out the third coin.

If you were to the release third coin, what do you think would happen?  If you could get ten good Christians to pray that this next coin wouldn’t fall, would it still fall?  How about one thousand faithful Muslims?  How about one million people of any faith?  I think that it would still fall.  Drop the third coin.  [Note: Some Christians claim that their god would not do such party tricks, but their Bible has many examples.]

Our understanding of the world around us, and our abilities to predict what will happen are based on naturalism — the basis of science.  Naturalism is also the basis for how all people live their lives most of the time.

To be explicit, modern science relies on methodological naturalism.  This means that science doesn’t incorporate any supernatural or religious assumptions and doesn’t seek any religious or supernatural explanations.  Science is the use of evidence to construct testable explanations and predictions of natural phenomena, as well as the knowledge generated through this process.  Science also depends on mathematics, which likewise has no religious or supernatural component.

In “Cosmos” Neil deGrasse Tyson explained the basic rules of science.  “This adventure is made possible by generations of searchers strictly adherent to a simple set of rules.  Test ideas by experiments and observations.  Build on those ideas that pass the test.  Reject the ones that fail.  Follow the evidence wherever it leads, and question everything.  Accept these terms, and the cosmos is yours.”

Noted skeptics author Dr. Steven Novella wrote this about science: “What do you think science is?  There's nothing magical about science.  It is simply a systematic way for carefully and thoroughly observing nature and using consistent logic to evaluate results.  Which part of that exactly do you disagree with?  Do you disagree with being thorough?  Using careful observation?  Being systematic?  Or using consistent logic?”

OK, let’s do another experiment.  If you were to take two coins and glue them together, then drop them at the same time as you drop a single coin, would they fall twice as fast as the single coin?  Aristotle (384 BCE* – 322 BCE) thought so, and for over 1900 years his ideas were what was taught about this and many other subjects.  Some of the other ancient Greeks had many ideas that are now a basis for modern science, engineering, math, philosophy, and democracy.  Unfortunately for humankind, these ideas were largely forgotten for almost two thousand years while religion took control and Aristotle was revered as the source of supposedly scientific knowledge. 

## Galileo and Empirical Science

Around 1600, Galileo had a new idea for his culture.  He decided to do something that now seems like common sense — to actually test the idea of what we now call gravity.  He reasoned that two weights held together would fall at the same rate as one weight.  Then he did experiments to test the idea — and, not surprisingly to us, it was true.  This was the start of modern empirical science, and our collective understanding of the universe hasn’t been the same since.

“Empirical” is a word that I'll be using a lot.  It refers to ideas that are capable of being verified or disproved by observation or experiment.  Empirical evidence is not simply one type of evidence, but rather it is the only evidence that we can rely on, because it is reproducible.  Empirical evidence is the basis for physical science.

Galileo also took the new invention of the telescope, refined it, and used it to look at the night sky.  He was astounded.  On the moon he could see mountains and valleys.  It wasn’t just some strange heavenly object; it was probably made out of the same stuff as Earth.  In 1610 Galileo looked at Jupiter and discovered that he could see four moons.  If moons orbited Jupiter then not everything orbited Earth, as the Catholic Church taught.  The motions of the planets in our skies made sense if the theories of Copernicus were true, and Earth and the other planets orbited the sun.  This was what Galileo taught, and in 1616 he had to appear before the Catholic Church’s Inquisition.  They banned him from teaching this idea, which was “opposed to the true faith and contrary to Holy Scripture.”  However, Galileo later got permission from the pope (a friend of his) to write a book, as long as the Church's ideas and Galileo's were given equal weight.  Galileo's book did not treat the two ideas equally, of course, so he was called to Rome in 1632 by the Inquisition, and told to recant his heretical ideas.

This was no “simple request” by the Church.  The Inquisition had already executed Galileo’s friend Giordano Bruno.  Have you heard of him?  In 1600, the Christian authorities in Rome took him out of the dungeon he had been in for eight years, drove a nail thru ** his tongue, tied him to a metal post, put wood and some of his books under his feet, and burned him to death.  Bruno’s crime was writing ideas that the Catholic leaders didn’t like — Earth revolves around the sun, the sun is a star, there might be other worlds with other intelligent beings on them, Jesus didn’t possess god-like power, and souls can’t go to Heaven.  For these heretical ideas, the Catholic Church punished this brilliant man with a slow, agonizing death.

Bruno was not the only man executed by the Christians for heretical ideas.  At least 77 others were either burned alive or hanged by the Roman Inquisition between 1553 and 1600.  Over the centuries, [millions were killed in religious wars or for heresy](http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/christian/blfaq_viol_reformation.htm) (which often meant simply being the “wrong” type of Christian).  Sometimes it was more explicit heresy which threatened the church's lock on truth.  The Italian freethinker Lucilio Vanini advanced a naturalistic philosophy and suggested that humans evolved from apes.  In 1618 he was tried in France and found guilty of atheism and witchcraft.  He had his tongue cut out, he was hanged, and his body was burned — as was customary with all heretics.  Six years later the French Parliament even decreed that criticism of Aristotle was punishable by death, and many more heretics were burned.  In Spain the [Inquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Inquisition) killed tens of thousands over a period of four centuries.

Galileo no doubt knew what he was up against.  For the crime of heresy the Inquisition could put him in a dungeon, torture or even execute him.  So, after a long trial, this proud 70 year-old man obediently got on his knees and dutifully recanted.  But even after recanting, he was still sentenced to house arrest for the rest of his life.  The Catholic Church officially condemned heliocentrism 31 years later, when Pope Alexander VII banned all books that affirmed Earth’s motion.  However, even as powerful as the Church was, they could not hold back the tidal wave of scientific discovery.  The Church eventually lost its battle over our view of the universe, but it only took them over three hundred years to admit it.  In 1992, after 12 years of deliberations, they grudgingly noted that Galileo had been right in supporting the Copernican theories.  Even then, they ascribed his genius to God, “who, stirring in the depths of his spirit, stimulated him, anticipating and assisting his intuitions.”  But no such reprieve has been given for Bruno.  His writings are still on the Vatican’s list of forbidden texts, and Pope John Paul II refused to even apologize for the Catholic Church's torture killing of Bruno.

Galileo and others started something big — empirical science.  Thru ** science and the scientific method, we have come to a good understanding of the workings of the world and universe around us.  The weather, lightning, thunder, the planets and stars, disease, and life itself all function based on fairly well understood principles.  A god doesn’t control them; the physical properties of matter and energy control the universe.  This principle is at the center of naturalism — the idea that only matter and energy exist, and they have properties that are repeatable, understandable, and quantifiable within the limits of quantum mechanics.  Naturalism is founded on the ancient Greek philosophy of materialism.  We take naturalism so for granted that we typically don’t realize that it is based on several articles of faith.  This faith, however, is quite different from religious faith (which is “unevidenced belief” or “pretending to know things you don’t know”).  This faith can be called “justified confidence” and is based on overwhelming past experience and results.  It is the faith that:

* There is an external world that exists independently of our minds.
* There are quantifiable natural laws that describe how things happen in this world, and we can attempt to understand them.
* These natural laws won’t change when we’re not looking; the universe isn’t totally chaotic. 

So far this faith in naturalism has been well-founded, as shown by the amazing accomplishments of modern science, engineering and medicine. 

## God of the Gaps, or Argument From Ignorance

Until just a couple of hundred years ago, most people thought that a god or gods controlled everything.  Why did the wind blow?  Why was there lightning and thunder?  Why did the sun, moon, and stars apparently go around Earth?  Why did someone get sick and die?  Why did anything happen?  Well, obviously, God did it.  If a person doesn’t know how something works or why something happened, they can say, “God did it.”  This is known as the “**god of the gaps**,” or the “**argument from ignorance**,” and it is at the heart of the conflict between science and religion.  Science looks for natural causes, while religion looks for supernatural causes.  Science is steadily winning, because as we understand more and more about the universe, the gap where a god might function grows smaller and smaller.  Every time we learn more, gods have less room to operate.  When we learned what caused the sun to apparently move across the sky, there was no need for the Greek god Helios and his chariot or the Egyptian god Ra and his barge.  When we understood what caused lightning, there was no need for the Greek god Zeus, the Roman god Jupiter, or the Norse god Thor.

In fact, the understanding of lightning was one of the first areas of battle between science and Christianity.  When Ben Franklin discovered that lightning was just a big electric spark, he invented the lightning rod.  It was enormously successful at preventing buildings from being struck by lightning.  However, this caused a bit of a conundrum for the church leaders; should they trust in their god to prevent lightning strikes on their churches, or should they use these new lightning rods?  Up until then, lightning hit churches much more frequently than other, more “deserving” buildings — such as taverns or houses of ill repute.  “Why was that?” they might have wondered.  Could it be that churches had spires and were taller, or was it SATAN and his WITCHES? ……  Actually, that is what they often believed, and many a supposed witch was executed for having caused the destruction of a church.  When they started putting lightning rods on churches, witch killings stopped soon thereafter.  However, the obvious fact is that they were putting their trust in science and lightning rods, not religion and prayer.
