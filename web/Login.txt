Hi Ed,

I hope that you're doing well.

It's been a while since you set up godlessgeeks.com, and it appears that I need your help again in transferring it so that I can manage it.

It looks like you have full control and ownership over the domain.  Could you make the change to the DNS pointer?  While updating the domain, could you add me as one of the contacts so I'm allowed to make changes myself?

I think that this is the info you need:

A new domain has been created in Plesk.
Domain name: godlessgeeks.com
Domain owner: Mark Thomas
Domain IP: 74.208.218.5

The server IP address is 74.208.218.5
Username = "godlessgeek"
Password= "@@44$quickly$LAST$bridge$47@@"

I'm sure that you'll let me know if you need more info, or if there are any expenses.  Also, I'm not knowledgeable on this interwebs stuff, so please excuse any confusion.

BTW, I've received many compliments on the name "godlessgeeks.com"

Thank you,
Mark
