<h3>Why this once exciting and 'liberating' philosophy failed
to capture the world's imagination.</h3>

<p class="arttext">The celebration of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in
June 1897 marked the high point of British imperial history. It was a supreme
moment of national self-confidence and congratulation. The British had created
an empire on which the sun never set, and much of its colorful diversity was on
display in the streets of London that summer.</p>
<p class="arttext">But Earth's proud empires fade away. The same process of
growth and decay can be seen in the empires of the mind. There comes a point
when their attraction pales and their credibility falters. To wit: Atheism is in
trouble. Its future seems increasingly to lie in the private beliefs of
individuals rather than in the great public domain it once regarded as its
natural habitat.</p>
<p class="arttext"><span class="arthead2">Pathology No Longer</span><br>
Atheism was once new, exciting, and liberating, and for those reasons held to be
devoid of the vices of the faiths it displaced. With time, it turned out to have
just as many frauds, psychopaths, and careerists as religion does. Many have now
concluded that these personality types are endemic to all human groups, rather
than being the peculiar preserve of religious folks. With Stalin and Madalyn
Murray O'Hair, atheism seems to have ended up mimicking the vices of the Spanish
Inquisition and the worst televangelists, respectively.</p>
<p class="arttext">One of the most important criticisms that Sigmund Freud
directed against religion was that it encourages unhealthy and dysfunctional
outlooks on life. Having dismissed religion as an illusion, Freud went on to
argue that it is a negative factor in personal development. At times, Freud's
influence has been such that the elimination of a person's religious beliefs has
been seen as a precondition for mental health.</p>
<p class="arttext">Freud is now a fallen idol, the fall having been all the
heavier for its postponement. There is now growing awareness of the importance
of spirituality in health care, both as a positive factor in relation to
well-being and as an issue to which patients have a right. The
"Spirituality and Healing in Medicine" conference sponsored by Harvard
Medical School in 1998 brought reports that 86 percent of Americans as a whole,
99 percent of family physicians, and 94 percent of hmo professionals believe
that prayer, meditation, and other spiritual and religious practices exercise a
major positive role within the healing process.</p>
<p class="arttext"><span class="arthead2">Restoring Community</span><br>
With the breakdown of social cohesion in recent decades, creating a sense of
community has become an increasingly important political issue in many Western
cultures. The question of how community can be recovered invites a comparison of
religious and atheistic approaches.</p>
<p class="arttext">One of the most obvious indicators of the ongoing importance
of religion is the well-documented tendency of immigrant communities to define
themselves in religious terms—Sikh, Hindu, and Muslim communities in Great
Britain, and in France, Muslims from Algeria and other North African nations.</p>
<p class="arttext">Christian churches have long been the centers of community
life in the West. People want to belong, not just believe.</p>
<p class="arttext">The growth of community churches has helped meet this need.
There is a sense of belonging to a common group, of shared common values, and of
knowing each other. People don't just <i>go</i> to community churches; they see
themselves as <i>belonging</i> there. At a time when American society appears to
be fragmenting, the community churches offer cohesion.</p>
<p class="arttext">It is important to make this connection with the changing
face of America. In his much-cited article "The Age of Social
Transformation," published in the November 1994 <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>,
management guru Peter Drucker pointed out that traditional communities of
family, village, and parish have practically disappeared.</p>
<p class="arttext">"Their place has largely been taken by the new unit of
social integration, the organization," Drucker wrote. "Where community
was fate, organization is voluntary membership." In the old days, community
was defined by where you lived. It was part of the inherited order of things,
something that you were born into. Now, it has to be <i>created</i>—and the
agency that creates this community is increasingly the voluntary organization.
Christian churches are strategically placed to create and foster community. The
community churches have proved especially effective in this role, and have grown
immensely in consequence.</p>
<p class="arttext">But what of atheism? The former Soviet Union realized the
importance of creating a sense of community. Having eliminated religion from the
public life of the nation, Soviet planners recognized the importance of creating
rituals and events, which fostered social cohesion and a sense of identity. Thus
the Saturday just before Easter was celebrated as Communist Saturday. Other
holidays included May Day, Victory Day (May 9), Constitution Day (October 7),
and Revolution Day (November 7-8). The Soviets devised additional rituals as
counterparts to the Christian rites of baptism and confirmation—for example,
the "family event" to mark the birth of a new child, or the ceremony
to mark admission to the Communist Party.</p>
<p class="arttext">The nearest thing in the West to this Soviet model is found
in Canada, which seems to think that a sense of community identity can only be
created by eliminating any religious presence in the public arena. In the United
States, atheism spawns organizations; it does not create community. The state
chapters and national convention of American Atheists, coupled with this
organization's atheist equivalent of creeds, certainly did something to create a
sense of shared identity. Yet the community thus created seems to be based
solely on distaste for religion. It doesn't even have a good organizational base
and lacks charismatic leadership—a fatal weakness, to which we now turn.</p>
<p class="arttext"><span class="arthead2">Institutional Atheism</span><br>
Atheist thinkers are more than happy to appear on the nation's chat shows to
promote their latest books. But they have failed to communicate a compelling
vision of atheism that is capable of drawing and holding large numbers of
people.</p>
<p class="arttext">Atheists widely discuss this comprehensive failure of
leadership within their circles. Howard Thompson, sometime editor of the <i>Texas
Atheist</i>, is undoubtedly one of the most able and reflective atheists in the
United States. Thompson has criticized the movement for its lack of direction:
"Atheism in America is poorly defined with little organization," he
wrote in an op-ed piece. "We have less social and cultural infrastructure
than even the smallest religious groups. . . . Atheism desperately needs
effective public voices."</p>
<p class="arttext">And why has this failed to happen? Thompson lays much of the
blame at the feet of O'Hair, whom he regards as the movement's greatest
liability. He believes her organization has failed to learn from her mistakes
and persists in depicting her as a hero, even a martyr, for the atheist cause.</p>
<p class="arttext">For 30 years O'Hair was the most visible atheist. What O'Hair
did and said was atheism to the public, and it was nasty. The disappearance of
the O'Hairs in September 1995 gave hope that more positive atheist initiatives
might develop. That's why atheists should worry about the revival of her
American Atheists under the leadership of Ellen Johnson, who assumed the office
of president in a questionable board of directors meeting. Johnson is also a
die-hard O'Hair fan who continues to present her as an atheist heroine. What
atheism doesn't need is a continuation of O'Hair's negativity; her style and
limited vision stifled positive atheist growth.</p>
<p class="arttext">Her atheism was crude, anti-intellectual, and homophobic,
making even the most zealous fundamentalist Christian seem a model of liberal
values. For Thompson, the answer is clear: Grow leaders. In another op-ed piece,
"The Unlit Bonfire," Thompson argues that a new dawn awaits—if only
the leadership issue can be resolved. "Total victory is the only acceptable
goal in a mind-control war because humanity is diminished so long as a single
mind remains trapped in superstition by programming or choice." But who
will lead them? And can this goal actually be achieved?</p>
<p class="arttext">The fatal flaw within Thompson's argument, found within many
other atheist tracts and publications, is his strident insistence that humanity
has been enslaved by supernaturalist superstition. It is merely necessary to
educate people, he believes, and these mad ideas will fall away. Thompson and
his colleagues have not even begun to understand a fundamental fact about
religion: People actually like their faith, find it helpful in structuring their
lives, and inconveniently believe that it might actually be true.</p>
<p class="arttext">Thompson's alternative to the rich fare of a transcendent
faith is "a materialistic culture that frees humanity from
superstition." This sounds dull, dated, and gray, about as exciting as a
lecture on Bulgarian Marxist dialectics. The failure of atheism to capture the
public imagination in the West reflects its failure to articulate a compelling,
imaginative vision of a godless future that is capable of exciting people and
making them want to gather together to celebrate and proclaim it.</p>
<p class="arttext">The same dullness pervades the National Secular Society
(founded in 1866), the nearest thing Great Britain has to an atheist network. In
2002, its website included a museum of modernity, untroubled by the awkward rise
of postmodernity. You could buy a secular mug with the slogan "Just say no
to religion!" Or even better, you could download an official Certificate of
De-Baptism (medieval font needed) that lets your friends know that you have
rejected the "creeds and all other such superstition" in the name of
reason.</p>
<p class="arttext">Rationalism, having quietly died out in most places, still
lives on here. Yet Western culture has bypassed this aging little ghetto, having
long since recognized the limitations of reason. The Enlightenment lives on for
secularists. Atheism is wedded to philosophical modernity, and both are aging
gracefully in the cultural equivalent of an old folks' home.</p>
<p class="arttext">And, for those who find their tracts wearisome, the society
thoughtfully provides a religious jokes page—though in poor taste, they carry
a significantly higher intellectual content than the rest of the site. Here's an
example of atheism's winsome arguments: <i>Question: What's the difference
between Jesus and a painting? Answer: It only takes one nail to hang a painting.</i></p>
<p class="arttext">The joke makes my friends outside the church cringe. Yet I
have the impression this is actually meant to persuade people of the
intellectual and cultural superiority of a world without religion. Thompson
clearly has a point.</p>
<p class="arttext">Nevertheless, serious issues are occasionally debated on the
website, including the question of why secular humanism, with its commitment to
atheism, has so singularly failed to capture the public imagination. One obvious
answer might be the National Secular Society itself, which exudes a pious
tedium, trapped in a time warp of the closing decades of the 19th century, that
seems almost to have been deliberately designed to alienate potential recruits.</p>
<p class="arttext">Reginald Le Sueur put his finger unerringly on the real point
at issue: "The problem with humanism as such is that, although rational,
secular, and 'true,' it is, in comparison with major religions, somewhat
wishy-washy and just plain unexciting."</p>
<p class="arttext">Le Sueur recognizes atheism as derivative, its attraction
residing primarily in what it denies rather than what it articulates as an
alternative. So does atheism have a future?</p>
<p class="arttext">No doubt it does—but not an especially distinguished or
exciting future. Listen to John Updike: "Among the repulsions of atheism
for me has been its drastic uninterestingness as an intellectual position."
I have to confess that I now share his catatonic sense of utter tedium when I
reread some of the atheist works I once found fascinating as a teenager. They
now seem simplistic, failing to engage with the complexities of human
experience, and seriously out of tune with our postmodern culture.</p>
<p class="arttext"><span class="arthead2">Why Atheism Matters</span><br>
On the other hand, the greatest virtue of atheism is its moral seriousness—its
criticisms and passionate demands for justice directed against the corruptions
of, say, the French church of the 18th century.</p>
<p class="arttext">The moral passion of atheism, especially when set alongside
the laziness and complacency of European state churches in the 18th century,
cannot be dismissed. Some Christian leaders at the time of the French Revolution
saw that event as a divine judgment against a failing church. Some believed God
was using the atheist critiques of the church as a means of reforming it.</p>
<p class="arttext">Paradoxically, what propels people toward atheism is above
all a sense of revulsion against the excesses and failures of organized
religion. Atheism is ultimately a worldview of fear—a fear, often merited, of
what might happen if religious maniacs were to take over the world.</p>
<p class="arttext">As the critics of Homeric religion made clear, the
attractions of a godless world rest upon a sense of revulsion against the gods.
Who wanted to worship or imitate gods such as Zeus and Athena, when they merely
immortalized the worst moral failings of human beings?</p>
<p class="arttext"><span class="arthead2">Moving Target</span><br>
In the end, debates about whether God's existence can be proved remain marginal.
The central issue is moral and imaginative. The most fundamental criticisms
directed against Christianity have to do with the moral character of its God.
They often focus on the issue of eternal punishment. No theological issue posed
greater difficulties for Victorian England, as the writings of George Eliot make
clear. It was for this reason that Charles Darwin found his faith, surprisingly
unchallenged by his views on evolution, to be stretched beyond its modest
capacity.</p>
<p class="arttext">Others had similarly serious misgivings. "Eternal
punishment must be eternal cruelty," said secular humanist orator Robert G.
Ingersoll (1833-1899), "and I do not see how any man, unless he has the
brain of an idiot, or the heart of a wild beast, can believe in eternal
punishment." Despite its opportunistic overstatement, Ingersoll's complaint
resonates deeply with many who find a contradiction between their deepest
intuitions of fairness and the Christian God.</p>
<p class="arttext">We cannot assert eternal damnation and expect Western culture
to nod approvingly. This culture is not predisposed to reject Christian
doctrines as a matter of principle; rather, it is surprised by what seems a
massive retreat from society's fundamental notions of decency and
evenhandedness. Atheism arises mainly through a profound sense that religious
ideas and values are at least inferior to, and possibly irreconcilable with, the
best moral standards and ideals of human culture.</p>
<p class="arttext">In its most intense and authentic forms, atheism enters a
powerful protest against what it sees to be morally or intellectually inferior
visions of reality. In their place, atheism offers visions of a larger freedom,
allowing humanity to throw aside its chains and enter a new and glorious phase
in history. It is perhaps not surprising that many sympathize with Dostoyevsky's
character Ivan Karamazov when he respectfully returns God's ticket, in the face
of the suffering, pain, and injustice of the world. Christianity must provide
good answers to such fair questions.</p>
<p class="arttext">But the real significance of atheism has to do with its
critique of power and privilege. Whatever their failings, atheist organizations
are right in challenging the idea that any religious grouping can enjoy special
privileges in a democratic society. Such groupings deserve respect. But when
religion becomes the establishment, a corrupting abuse of power can result.
Atheism soars in its appeal.</p>
<p class="arttext">The converse can be true. The rise of militant Islam in
Afghanistan was the direct outcome of the Soviet invasion of that nation in 1979
and its clumsy attempts to support an atheistic regime. As Karen Armstrong
points out in her <i>The Battle for God</i> (2000), the best way to encourage
the rise of religious fundamentalism is to impose a secular agenda on people who
want to get on with their religious lives.</p>
<p class="arttext">Atheism's concerns about the Christian exertion of power
resonate with many within the church. The assumption of the New Testament is
that Christianity is excluded from the establishment and thus insulated from the
temptations and corruption that power brings. For many reflective Christians,
the church began to lose its compelling moral and spiritual vision with the
conversion of Constantine, the first Christian Roman emperor. A movement that
was at its most authentic while powerless and weak now became exposed to forces
that compromised its integrity.</p>
<p class="arttext">Yet it must be noted that Christianity is a dynamic entity,
constantly changing in its forms as it seeks to relate its foundational heritage
in the New Testament to the situations in which it finds itself. Atheist
criticisms of the church are at their most compelling and persuasive when they
are directed against the failings of the church.</p>
<p class="arttext">The essential difficulty here is that, with the rise of
dynamic churches especially in the Southern Hemisphere, the classic atheist
criticisms of the church do not quite ring true any longer—even in the
homelands of the much-derided state churches of Western Europe. The repetition
of stale clichés from the golden age of atheism sounds increasingly out of
touch with postmodern reality.</p>
<p class="arttext">The atheist dilemma is that Christianity is a moving target,
whose trajectory is capable of being redirected without losing its anchor point
in the New Testament. And as theologian John Henry Newman pointed out,
Christianity must listen to such criticisms from outside its bounds, precisely
because listening may be a way of recapturing its vision of the gospel.</p>
<p class="arttext">Some atheists have argued that the phenomenon of
globalization can only advance a secularist agenda, eliminating religion from
the public arena. If the world is to have a shared future, it can only be by
eliminating what divides its nations and peoples—such as religious beliefs.
Yet many have pointed out in response that globalization seems to be resulting
in a quite different outcome.</p>
<p class="arttext">Far from being secularized, the West is experiencing a new
interest in religion. Patterns of immigration mean that Islam and Hinduism are
now major living presences in the cities of Western Europe and North America.
Pentecostalism is a rapidly growing force, strengthened by the arrival of many
Asian and African Christians in the West. The future looks nothing like the
godless and religionless world so confidently predicted 40 years ago. The
atheist agenda, once seen as a positive force for progress, is now seen as
disrespectful toward cultural diversity.</p>
<p class="arttext">Paradoxically, the future of atheism will be determined by
its religious rivals. Those atheists looking for a surefire way to increase
their appeal need only to hope for harsh, vindictive, and unthinking forms of
religion to arise in the West.</p>
<p class="arttext">In his problematic but fascinating work, <i>The Decline of
the West</i>, Oswald Spengler argued that history shows that cultures came into
being for religious reasons. As they exhausted the potential of that
spirituality, religion gave way to atheism, before a phase of religious renewal
gave them a new sense of direction. Might atheism have run its course, and now
give way to religious renewal? The tides of cultural shift have, for the time
being, left atheism beached on the sands of modernity, while Westerners explore
a new postmodern interest in the forbidden fruit of spirituality.
