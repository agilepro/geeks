It's strange how people see the Pope as a good person.
Compared to his predecessor, Pope Benedict, maybe.
It's almost like THEY ALREADY FORGOT:
* He still REJECTS GAY MARRIAGE in fear of its potential to destroy the "traditional" family.
* He still passionately supports an INTERNATIONAL PROHIBITION ON BIRTH CONTROL, even in poor and AIDS-ravaged countries.
* He COMPARES TRANSGENDER PEOPLE TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS in their ability to wreak havoc on the "natural order of creation."
* He VICTIM-BLAMED THE DEAD WRITERS of Charlie Hebro with the suggestion that free speech must end where criticism of religion begins.
