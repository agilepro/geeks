<h1 align>Early Americans Outlawed Christmas</h1>
By Jennifer Viegas, Discovery News<p>
<br>
"Dec. 23, 2003; For 22 years, celebrating Christmas was a crime in<br>		
Massachusetts, where observers of the holiday were subjected to fines<br>		
and "mince smellers," individuals who were paid to patrol streets to<br>		
sniff out those who might be baking traditional mincemeat pies around<br>		
Dec. 25.<br>		
<br>
America's mid-17th century inobservance of Christmas, which was also<br>		
practiced in Pennsylvania and parts of the South, is described<br>		
in "The Book of the Year &#23; A History of Our Holidays" by Colgate<br>		
University professor Anthony Aveni.<br>		
<br>
According to a recent Colgate press release, Aveni credits Protestant<br>		
reformists for the 1659-1681 law against Christmas. He said they<br>		
viewed the holiday as "another one of those idol-worshipping<br>		
religious festivals well worth expunging."<p>
Jack Larkin, museum scholar and chief historian at Old Sturbridge<br>		
Village, a Massachusetts living museum that recreates life in a small<br>		
New England town circa 1790-1840, was not surprised to learn of the<br>		
ban, given the first American Christmas.<br>		
<br>
Larkin explained that in 1621, Plymouth Colony governor William<br>		
Bradford granted two men permission to not work on Christmas Day.<br>		
When the governor later found the men tossing a ball back and forth,<br>		
Bradford confiscated the ball and reprimanded them, saying they could<br>		
only stay in the colony if they were "better instructed" about<br>		
reformist Protestant beliefs.<br>		
<br>
"The first attempt to celebrate Christmas was squelched, and this<br>		
seemed to establish the tradition of nonobservance in New England,"<br>		
Larkin told Discovery News.<p>
The 1659 law forbidding Christmas celebrations read as follows:<br>		
<br>
"For preventing disorders, arising in several places within this<br>		
jurisdiction by reason of some still observing such festivals as were<br>		
superstitiously kept in other communities, to the great dishonor of<br>		
God and offense of others: it is therefore ordered by this court and<br>		
the authority thereof that whosoever shall be found observing any<br>		
such day as Christmas or the like, either by forbearing of labor,<br>		
feasting, or any other way, upon any such account as aforesaid, every<br>		
such person so offending shall pay for every such offence five<br>		
shilling as a fine to the county."<p>
Even after the law's repeal, many New Englanders shunned the holiday<br>		
and its supporters. In 1687, Reverend Increase Mather said Christmas<br>		
celebrants "are consumed in Compotations, in Interludes, in playing<br>		
at Cards, in Revellings, in excess of Wine, in mad Mirth ..."<p>
Views were not quite as harsh in New York, where settlers included<br>		
German and Dutch Protestants who celebrated the December feast day of<br>		
Santa Claus, and in Anglican Virginia, according to Jim Bradley,<br>		
public relations manager of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation.<br>		
<br>
"Due to the political turmoil in England at the time, Virginia and<br>		
other colonies were left alone and puritanical laws against the<br>		
observation of Christmas were not enforced here," explained Bradley.<p>
While many early New Englanders worked as usual on Dec. 25, Bradley<br>		
said Virginians who could afford it would have attended mass before<br>		
feasting on such traditional foods as turkey, Virginia ham, rum<br>		
punch, plum pudding, and the Massachusetts-banned mince pies,<br>		
followed by singing carols and attending an evening fireworks display.<p>
It was not until the early 19th century that interest in celebrating<br>		
Christmas resurrected the holiday nationwide."</p>
