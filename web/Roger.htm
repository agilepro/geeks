think, the Ten Commandments and prayer is coming back to school.<p>

Hello Roger,<p>

You were kind enough to send me your thoughts, so I will return the favor.<p>

Have you noticed that this god you trust in doesn't really care about<br>
you or anyone else?<p>

If this supposedly omnipotent god could have stopped the events of<br>
9/11/01 (or any other terrible event), but didn't, then the god is<br>
culpable and immoral.  If he could not, then he isn't omnipotent.  The<br>
morals of the Christian and Jewish god, as portrayed in the Bible are<br>
contemptible.  In one story, he kills almost everyone and everything on<br>
the planet because he didn't like what the humans were doing.  This is<br>
barbaric!  In other stories the Hebrews working under his auspices<br>
killed every living thing in villages, taking special note to rip open<br>
pregnant women.  If a human had these morals, we would classify him as<br>
a complete sadist and sociopath.<p>

Then, there is the Christian concept of hell, a truly vile idea that<br>
means that punishment for supposed sins continues forever.<p>

It has been claimed that it wasn't Jesus, but his disciples, who<br>
created the idea of hell.  As a Jew, Jesus had no belief in hell.<p>

Whether Jesus actually existed is highly questionable, with no reliable<br>
historical records referring to him.  For sake of argument, let's<br>
assume that he did exist.  Since he never wrote anything (at least that<br>
survived), the only way that we can know what he thought is by what<br>
people wrote about what he said.  Jesus purportedly said a lot of<br>
things, and many of them were contradictory.  This makes it easier for<br>
someone to quote him to back up a particular philosophical position.<p>

I did a little quick research, to determine where in the buybull "hell"<br>
is mentioned.  There were 15 results, and all were in the New<br>
Testament.  14 were in the gospels.  6 referred to cutting off your own<br>
body parts to prevent your going to hell.  The results are below.<p>

The Old Testament has no reference to hell; punishment ceased at<br>
death.  The New Testament creates the concept of eternal punishment.<br>
Jesus may love you, but if you break his rules (and don't say you're<br>
sorry) you will get tortured forever.<p>

Of course, if you do say that you're sorry, you will get a clean<br>
slate.  Even Hitler, if he had confessed before he died, would get into<br>
heaven.  See Romans 10:9-10, below.<p>

For more interesting results, look up "servant, beat".  Note<br>
that 'servant' was a euphemism for 'slave'.  You will find that Jesus<br>
(in Luke 12:42-48, below) supposedly recommended that a slave should be<br>
cut into pieces, as a punishment for beating other slaves and getting<br>
drunk. Jesus also goes on to tell when servants may be beaten.<p>

Those who claim that morality comes from God (via the buybull), should<br>
take special note of these lines from Luke.  Also, not once in the<br>
entire buybull is slavery condemned, and it is often condoned - even by<br>
Jesus.<p>

------------------------<p>

Matthew 5:22<br>
But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother[ 5:22 Some<br>
manuscripts brother without cause] will be subject to judgment. Again,<br>
anyone who says to his brother, 'Raca,[ 5:22 An Aramaic term of<br>
contempt] 'is answerable to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You<br>
fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell.<p>

Matthew 5:29<br>
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It<br>
is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole<br>
body to be thrown into hell.<p>

Matthew 5:30<br>
And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away.<br>
It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole<br>
body to go into hell.<p>

Matthew 10:28<br>
Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul.<br>
Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.<p>

Matthew 16:18<br>
And I tell you that you are Peter,[ 16:18 Peter means rock.] and on<br>
this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades[ 16:18 Or<br>
hell] will not overcome it.[ 16:18 Or not prove stronger than it]<p>

Matthew 18:9<br>
And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It<br>
is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and<br>
be thrown into the fire of hell.<p>

Matthew 23:15<br>
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You<br>
travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when he becomes<br>
one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as you are.<p>

Matthew 23:33<br>
"You snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned<br>
to hell?<p>

Romans 10: 9-10<br>
That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in<br>
your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.<br>
For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is<br>
with your mouth that you confess and are saved.<p>

Luke 12:42-48<br>
The Lord answered, "Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the<br>
master puts in charge of his servants to give them their food allowance<br>
at the proper time?<br>
It will be good for that servant whom the master finds doing so when he<br>
returns.<br>
I tell you the truth, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.<br>
But suppose the servant says to himself, 'My master is taking a long<br>
time in coming,' and he then begins to beat the menservants and<br>
maidservants and to eat and drink and get drunk.<br>
The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect<br>
him and at an hour he is not aware of. He will cut him to pieces and<br>
assign him a place with the unbelievers.<br>
"That servant who knows his master's will and does not get ready or<br>
does not do what his master wants will be beaten with many blows.<br>
But the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will<br>
be beaten with few blows. From everyone who has been given much, much<br>
will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much,<br>
much more will be asked.<p>

-------------------<p>

Roger, is this a god that is worthy of worship?  Is there any empirical<br>
evidence that he even exists?  But, you will probably go on with your<br>
childish worship of this father figure, ignoring the real evidence of<br>
the world around you.  Or, you could decide to grow up, cast your<br>
superstitions aside, and realize that there are no gods, no heaven, and<br>
no hell.  It's just us humans trying to live our lives as best as we<br>
can.<p>

If you do decide to actually think for yourself, we've collected many<br>
articles and URLs on our website.  You can take a look around and see<br>
how religions are built on lies and gullibility.<p>

Our nation was founded as the first country that derived its power from<br>
a purely secular, nonreligious basis. All nations before then had kings<br>
and queens who used their supposed "god-given divine right" to rule.<br>
Instead of this top-down power structure, our founders wisely created a<br>
government which derived its powers from the consent of the governed.<br>
They also realized the inherent divisiveness of religion, and kept it<br>
specifically out of our Constitution and government. The Treaty of<br>
Tripoli, signed by President John Adams and unanimously approved by the<br>
Senate in 1797, stated "The Government of the United States is not in<br>
any sense founded on the Christian religion."<p>

<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Mark Thomas<p>

Can anyone look at the carnage in Iran, the bloodshed in Northern<br>
Ireland, or the bombs bursting in Lebanon and yet question the dangers<br>
of injecting religious issues into the affairs of state?"<p>

Hello Mark,<p>

I believe it was because of God that the events of 9/11 took place. It is<br>
the immoral values that this nation has took on that will destroy it. I<br>
hope and pray that we have more 9/11s and maybe people will wake up.<p>

This nation is now on a down hill slide with the stock market and I do not<br>
believe it will recover. The Bible says that the whore that sets upon may<br>
waters will be destroyed in 1 hour. Bring it on and get me out of this<br>
sickness that you stand for.<p>

Hello Roger,<p>

You, sir, have lost your humanity.  Would you feel the same if it were<br>
someone you loved or cared about who had died on 9/11?  Would you feel the<br>
same if you were a likely next target?<p>

Your position is immoral.  'Punishing' someone for the crimes of another has<br>
no moral basis, other than in Christianity -- where Christ's supposed<br>
sacrifice is considered laudable.<p>

Your god is immoral.  In your myths, he created the earth, then got mad at<br>
some of his people.  So, he killed almost everyone and everything on the<br>
planet.  In other stories, his followers often killed everyone and<br>
everything in villages -- with his blessings.<p>

Your bible is immoral.  It celebrates those heinous activities of its god.<br>
It also condones slavery, never once condemning it.  Sure, it's got some<br>
nice stories in it; but, they don't make up for the immorality it forgives<br>
and even recommends.<p>

Thus, your religion is immoral, because it is based on your god and your<br>
bible.<p>

<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Mark<p>

<p>

==========================<p>

Hello Mark,<p>

You, sir, are ignorant of my God and the Bible. There are rewards for the<br>
just and rewards for the unjust. The choice is of those who make their<br>
choices. I pray that the time would come that all would receive the reward<br>
that they have worked for.<p>

As far as humanity, I have plenty, but not for the evil that liberals have<br>
and support. What is abortion, but murder? What is the spread of sexual<br>
diseases, but immoral. What is associations like the ACLU, NAMBLA and GLAAD,<br>
but the gutter of society.<p>

No, Sir, my God is just in destroying the sickness that has infiltrated this<br>
world.<p>

In God I trust,<p>

Hello Roger,<p>

You are a sick man who wishes harm to others who have done nothing to you.<br>
History is full of such men who wanted to kill others simply because the<br>
others had broken their god's rules.  Luckily most of them were unable to<br>
actively fulfil their evil thoughts.  Hitler (a Christian) was one who was<br>
able to act on his desires.  Some of the most vile inflictions of pain from<br>
one human to another have occurred because of religion.  I want no part in<br>
it.<p>

Because of people like you, science and medicine were held back from making<br>
our lives better.  If you don't think science and medicine are useful, I<br>
suggest considering what your life would be like without them.  Life for<br>
people used to be short, brutal, and painfull -- until we gained from the<br>
materialistic insights of modern science and medicine.  If you disagree, I<br>
suggest that you try living without them.<p>

You say that your god rewards the just and the unjust.  Then, why do bad<br>
things happen to good people?  I'm sure that there were many who died in the<br>
WTC that both of us would classify as basically good people.  You will<br>
probably just give the standard cop-outs: 1) god works in mysterious ways,<br>
or 2) the good get their rewards in heaven.  Both responses have no<br>
empirical evidence to support them, just like religions.<p>

I repeat, would you feel the same if there were someone you loved or cared<br>
about who had died on 9/11?  Would you feel the same if you were a likely<br>
next target?  I doubt if you have the capacity to imagine this, because it<br>
comes from empathy, a basic human characteristic that you seem to be<br>
lacking.<p>

I distrust those people who know so well what God wants them to do<br>
because I notice it always coincides with their own desires.<p>

Sincerely,<br>
Mark<p>

You are an idiot. You are assuming that I want to kill anyone. The idea of<br>
murder is being resonated from your mind as your desires. This is the kind<br>
of stupidity that starts trouble. What I want is the immorality that you<br>
represent out of this world.<p>

I will not respond to any further messages.<p>

<br>
Hello Roger,<p>

You are the one who wished that more people will die, in this statement, "I <br>
hope and pray that we have more 9/11s and maybe people will wake up."  <br>
Should I tell the FBI that you are sympathetic to the terrorists' cause?<p>

Once again I ask you, would you feel the same if it were someone you loved <br>
or cared about who had died on 9/11?  Would you feel the same if you were a <br>
likely next target?<p>

You call abortion murder, but you have no biblical basis for this position.  <br>
In order to kill something, it has to be alive.  Your bible defines being <br>
alive as breathing, but a zygote or fetus is not breathing.<p>

I happen to agree that NAMBLA is scummy, but only because they advocate sex <br>
with children.  The ACLU fights for everyone's constitutional rights, <br>
including yours.  GLAAD is fighting for their constitutional rights, because <br>
we live in a country where our rights come from our constitution.  If you <br>
are basing your opposition to gays and lesbians on Biblical writings, note <br>
that Leviticus (where there are proscriptions against male homosexual <br>
behavior), also claims that insects have four legs, and that bats are birds.<p>

Yours is an invisible, weak and impotent god, who can't do anything without <br>
help from people.  The difference between invisible and non-existent is <br>
pretty much nothing.  There have been over 2500 gods in man's history.  You <br>
disbelieve in all but one.  I just disbelieve in one fewer than you.  There <br>
is no empirical evidence for any god, which leaves the existence of gods <br>
with as much validity as that of Santa Claus.<p>

Mark<p>
