Please vote against the Constitutional Amendment defining civil 
marriage using a theological definition (male/female only).  It is an improper intrusion of religion into government.  It is also an improper intrusion of the federal governemnt into people's private lives.  Note that there is nowhere in the Christian bible that clearly states "one man and one woman" or "monogamy" or any words to that effect, but references to abstinence and polygamy are plentiful.
