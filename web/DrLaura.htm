Laura Schlessinger is a US radio personality who dispenses advice to people
who call in to her radio show. Recently she said that homosexuality is an
abomination according to Leviticus 18:22, and cannot be condoned under any
circumstances.&nbsp; The following is an open letter to Dr. Laura penned by a
US resident, which was posted on the Internet.&nbsp; It's funny, as well as
informative.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Thank
you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law. I have learned a
great deal from your show, and try to share that knowledge with as many people
as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example,
I simply remind them that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an
abomination. End of debate.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">I
do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the other specific
laws and how to follow them.<o:p>

When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord -- Lev. 1:9.
The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them.

I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of
menstrual uncleanliness -- Lev. 15:19-24. The problem is, how do I tell? I

Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female,
provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims
that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I
own Canadians?<o:p>

A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination --
Lev. 11:10-- it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't
agree. Can you settle this?<o:p>

</span></font></i></span><font face="Arial" size=3 color="#0000FF">This word is used, (1.) To express the idea that the Egyptians considered themselves as defiled when they ate with strangers (Gen. 43:32). The Jews subsequently followed the same practice, holding it unlawful to eat or drink with foreigners (John 18:28; Acts 10:28; 11:3). (2.) Every shepherd was "an abomination" unto the Egyptians (Gen. 46:34). This aversion to shepherds, such as the Hebrews, arose probably from the fact that Lower and Middle Egypt had formerly been held in oppressive subjection by a tribe of nomad shepherds (the Hyksos), who had only recently been expelled, and partly also perhaps from this other fact that the Egyptians detested the lawless habits of these wandering shepherds. (3.) Pharaoh was so moved by the fourth plague, that while he refused the demand of Moses, he offered a compromise, granting to the Israelites permission to hold their festival and offer their sacrifices in Egypt. This permission could not be accepted, because Moses said they would have to sacrifice "the abomination of the Egyptians" (Ex. 8:26); i.e., the cow or ox, which all the Egyptians held as sacred, and which they regarded it as sacrilegious to kill. (4.) Daniel (11:31), in that section of his prophecies which is generally interpreted as referring to the fearful calamities that were to fall on the Jews in the time of Antiochus Epiphanes, says, "And they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate." Antiochus Epiphanes caused an altar to be erected on the altar of burnt-offering, on which sacrifices were offered to Jupiter Olympus. (Comp. 1 Macc. 1:57). This was the abomination of the desolation of Jerusalem. The same language is employed in Dan. 9:27 (comp. Matt. 24:15), where the reference is probably to the image-crowned standards which the Romans set up at the east gate of the temple (A.D. 70), and to which they paid idolatrous honours. "Almost the entire religion of the Roman camp consisted in worshipping the ensign, swearing by the ensign, and in preferring the ensign before all other gods." These ensigns were an "abomination" to the Jews, the "abomination of desolation." This word is also used symbolically of sin in general (Isa. 66:3); an idol (44:19); the ceremonies of the apostate Church of Rome (Rev. 17:4); a detestable act (Ezek. 22:11).</font>

My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting two different crops in
the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different
kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme
a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the
whole town together to stone them? -- Lev.24:10-16.&nbsp; Couldn't we just
burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep
with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)<o:p>
