We must be careful not to fall into the trap that so many do -- where we assume that others who share one aspect of ours also share other aspects.  Christians often assume that others of their ideology are good, as do Muslims, vegetarians, and many others.
 
The simple fact is that this is blatently false.  All of us can relate tales of when Christians and Muslims have done evil.  Atheists have also done evil -- even killing.  Two obvious examples are Mao and Stalin.  There have no doubt been common murderers who were Atheists.
 
Atheism is the conclusion that there are no gods, based on the evidence.  An Atheist is one who has no belief in any god or gods. This tells you nothing about any morality, political leanings, or diet that an Atheist might have.  I think that most Atheists, like most people, are basically good people.  Certainly, not all are.
 
In fact, "do no harm to others" does not even work well as a basic moral principle.  The classic example is the need to defend yourself, friends or family.
 
Christians often like to say that they have an absolute morality, and that non-believers have a relative morality (horror of horrors!).  The truth is that they have a relative morality, too.  Christians pick and choose what moral teachings in their buybull to follow.  I doubt if many Christians think that those who work on the Sabbath should be executed, altho the buybull mandates it.  A few think that gays should be executed, but most are against that, too.  Most Christians are against slavery, but even Jesus had recommendations about beating and killing slaves (Luke 12:42-48).  The Christian Bible, its god, and its savior all fail the morality test.
 
Morality is obviously a complex subject that does not lend itself completely to simple sayings.  It is a social construct that is based on our feelings of love and compassion, and on our mutual need to work together.
 
In reason,
Mark
