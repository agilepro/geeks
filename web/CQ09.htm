<p>NEVADA CITY â€“ At Camp Quest, campers may not believe in God, but they do have faith in their community.
On Sunday evening, 49 children from across the western United States
arrived at the camp nestled in the hills outside Nevada City. It is one
of five summer camps in the country for the children of atheists and
other nonbelievers.<p>In a campground in Malakoff Diggins State
Historical Park, the campers have many of the traditional summer
experiences. They practice archery in the meadow, participate in team
competitions and gather around the campfire at night to sing.
<p>Their activities, however, have a decidedly secular twist.
<p>Campers play games that encourage critical thinking such as one
called Evolution and another where they are asked to prove something
invisible doesn't exist.
<p>Before meals, they learn about freethinking heroes such as Margaret
Sanger and Isaac Asimov. Many of their camps songs promote rational
thought such as their version of this children's classic:
<p>Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
<br>You're a ball of gas that's very far
<br>32 light years in the sky
<br>10 parsecs which is really high...
<p>Here, it's all about celebrating their belief in not believing.
<p>"It's important for them to have a place to learn how to investigate
the world and to not accept what they hear," said camp director Chris
Lindstrom of Los Altos. "Plus the kids enjoy meeting other kids from
similar families."
<p>It makes them feel a part of a larger community.
<p>Atheism has been a subject of several recent best-sellers, including
Richard Dawkins' "The God Delusion" and Christopher Hitchens' "God is
Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything."
<p>Nonbelievers make up a small part of the population. According to the
Pew Forum's 2007 U.S. Religious Landscape Survey, 1.6 percent of the
adult population consider themselves atheist; 2.4 percent call
themselves agnostic.
<p>Camp Quest, which started in 1996 in Ohio, is now offered in
Minnesota, Michigan, Tennessee, Ontario and California. Attendance at
the California camp, officially called Camp Quest West, has gone from 14
to 49 in four years.
<p>Campers attribute the growth to positive word of mouth on atheist
chat sites.
<p>Soon after the campers arrived Sunday, they gathered outside the
dining hall. The children's ages range from 9 to 17. Most campers are
from California; some traveled from as far as New Mexico.
<p>After a brief introduction, they heard how Socrates questioned the
religion of his day. Afterward, the campers headed inside for a
spaghetti dinner. One joked aloud that here, at least, they wouldn't
have to say grace.
<p>Everyone who heard him laughed.
<p>Many campers said they were relieved to be with kids from other
atheist families.
<p>"I live in a small town and at my school a lot of the kids will
flaunt their religion," said Cameron Musser, 16, who wanted to attend
the camp to be around other nonbelievers. "We don't have to worry about
that here."
<p>Rebekah Hinckley, 12, learned about the camp from her parents, who
thought it was worth the drive from Oxnard and the $450 cost of the
six-night camp.
<p>While their parents are atheists or freethinkers, many of the
children said they are unsure of their beliefs. Hinckley said she is not
ready to label herself an atheist.
<p>"I don't really believe in God," said Hinckley. "But really, I'm just
not sure."
<p>That's exactly the kind of thinking-for-yourself that is encouraged
at Camp Quest.
<p>One lesson in critical thinking involved a campfire story about an
invisible monster name Schree. Camp staffers pretend they believe that a
monster exists because their parents told them so or a friend who told
them about it is really cool. They promise to pay a camper $10 to prove
it doesn't exist. No camper has ever won.
<p>"It helps them learn that these kind of arguments don't go anywhere,"
said Lindstrom. "And that they shouldn't believe everything they hear."
<p>Several campers have been to Camp Quest before. This is the camp's
fourth season. Last year was canceled because of nearby fires.
<p>Alexa Garcia, a 13-year-old from Albany, has attended the camp twice.
She likes the camp philosophy but also the activities. "I don't consider
myself anything right now. I just like the camp," she said.
<p>At 10, Lili Thorson is one of the youngest campers. Her father picked
out the camp for her. Lili does not know what she believes or doesn't
believe, though. "My dad told me I'm too young to decide yet."<p>
