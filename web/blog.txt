What I claim is that <b>there is no reliable historical record that Jesus ever existed -- NONE!</b>  One would think that a person of his supposed influence would have made an impression on historians of the time, but nobody seemed to have noticed him and wrote about it.  This proved to be an embarrasment to early Christians, and somebody attempted to cover it up by forging a section in the writings of Josephus.  This was probably done by Eusebius of Caesarea in the early 300's.  It was a lousy attempt that is easily dismissed after analysis.

The Biblical accounts of Jesus were written long after his supposed life.  Paul wrote in the 50's CE and never met Jesus.  To Paul, Jesus was more of a sky-god, with little or no Earthly existence.  The gospels were written after 70 CE, by unknown authors.  Mark was probably the first, and others copied extensively from it or from a hypothetical source called "Q" that could have been a source for all four gospels.

Many stories about Jesus were written to fulfill prophecy.  My favorite story about Jesus, (where he supposedly said, "Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.") was added centuries later by an unknown transcriber.

Some of my critiques about Christianity its god Yahweh are that they are contradictory as given in the Bible.  Yahweh both loves humans and kills them in great numbers (directly or indirectly).  The Jesus character is also denoted as loving, but tells a story where a slave master kills a slave for beating other slaves.  Jesus also tells his followers to get swords and to hate their family members.

My joke about sex fell flat.  However, we are all descended from people who had sex and also loved their children enough to help raise them.  This obviously is just generally true, not always true.

The essence of Christianity, as I see it, is love.  The essence of Humanism (and I'm also a Humanist) is love.  At that level, we're not far apart.
