I discovered that, before sharing this info, most people I know were
unaware of this resolution, just as they were unaware of the fact that
January 14th was officially proclaimed National Sanctity of Human Life
Day.  Nor were they aware that this was the 2nd NSHL Day we've had (the
first was January 20, 2002).  Nor were they aware of things like the
"Sneak & Peak" provision of the USA PATRIOT Atrocity which allows the
gov't to sneak into our houses when we are not home and go through our
stuff and never tell us.
