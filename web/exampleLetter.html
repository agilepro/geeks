<h3>A Good Example of a Letter Urging Star Jones to "Walk a Mile" in an Atheist's Shoes
Before Passing Judgement</h3>
<p>
Dear Star Jones:
<p>
I am a Humanist minister in Houston, Texas, where I perform the same functions for non-theists as Sectarian ministers do for members of their churches; for example I officiate at all of life's significant events for my community.<p>
Believe it or not Humanists, Atheists, and Freethinkers get married, celebrate the birth of their children and have memorial services for their loved ones when they die just like those who have different kinds of beliefs.  It is hurtful to our community when we hear rejecting language from respected national figures about people who believe with integrity as we do.<p>
I believe that a person should be judged on their character and how they behave with respect to their fellow beings and not be subjected to a religious test as qualification for public office.  In fact Article 6 of the constitution forbids all such religious tests.  Of course it is a matter of conscience what one does with his or her own vote. Just the same, I think that it is thoughtless and intolerant to make a judgement based on a person's personal philosophy if it contains only benign beliefs about the character and fate of our fellow humans on this planet.<p>
We would appreciate it if you would reconsider your opinion of us.  We are good citizens, and moral and ethical people who love our country and fellow humans as much as any other person.  We think that religious attitudes that denigrate and reject others tend to cause division and separation of our fellow humans into hostile camps. We would like to see religion become a force for uniting all the diverse people of our global village instead of as a source of division and strife.<p>
<p> Sincerely,<p>
Looking forward to the advent of the day when these hope will become a reality,
<p>

<p>P. S. It has been said that if you have a disagreement with another person you should walk a mile in their shoes. That way if they remain angry and finally realize what has happened, at least you are a mile away and they are barefoot.<p>
