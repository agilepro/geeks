<h2>Atheism, Love, and Morality</h2>
by Mark Thomas, president of Atheists of Silicon Valley<p>
Note: for Rabbi Gellman's article, see <a href=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12498143/site/newsweek/>Trying
to Understand Angry Atheists</a>.<p>

Rabbi Marc Gellman compares his opinion on the existence of the Judeo/Christian god with sports fans' love for their teams.&nbsp; The difference is that even the most rabid fan knows that there are other teams and wouldn't dream of forcing his opinion on everyone else — even on people who don't like sports.  It would be ludicrous for people to do this and outrageous for the government to encourage it.&nbsp; If this occurred some citizens would get upset or angry, especially if they discovered that the team that everyone is supposed to root for doesn't even exist.&nbsp; No one has ever actually seen this team, but most people seem to like believing in it because it makes them happy and gives them meaning.<p>

Most Atheists that I know are quite content living without the threats and enticements of a god we see as imaginary.&nbsp; We gain meaning from love and a well-lived life that can include helping others and working for a better world.&nbsp; We don't want other people's religious beliefs intruding into our government or our lives.&nbsp; We know that we are responsible for our behavior, and life is to be lived and treasured, not spent waiting for some illusory afterlife.&nbsp; We don't have the debasing idea that we are intrinsically sinful.&nbsp; We realize that Atheism is the simple conclusion that no gods exist, based on evidence and logic.&nbsp; Gods are just the external manifestations of both our base and good emotions.&nbsp; The supposedly sacred scriptures attributed to these gods similarly reflect the strengths and weaknesses of humankind.<p>

Atheists see god belief/religion as the excuse or source of some of the most heinous actions in history — slavery, the Crusades, the Inquisition, the executions of "witches," the prosecution and execution of scientists and free-thinkers, the many European religious wars, the Holocaust, and of course 9/11.<p>

Atheists know that fear and greed were at the root of those terrible things.&nbsp; Many also understand that enlightened self-interest and evolution-derived innate feelings have encouraged most humans to cooperate with our neighbors and to love our mates and children.&nbsp; Any ancient humans who didn't cooperate or love would have been less likely to survive in a tribe or leave offspring.&nbsp; Any humans who did cooperate and love would have been more likely to leave offspring.&nbsp; Evolution is the source of cooperation and love, not mandates from some god.<p>

Morality and laws are the rules of interaction that allow us to function cooperatively.&nbsp; They come from basic human kindness, compassion, and our need to work together — not from some static scripture.&nbsp; Morality and laws have evolved as humans have evolved our culture.<p>

Rabbi Gellman is correct in concluding that it's important to accomplish goals of improving the world.&nbsp; What's most important, I believe, is how we treat each other, not (as Dr. Watson noted) whether we believe in a god.&nbsp; We can all love and care for each other — if we so choose.<p>
