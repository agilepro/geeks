<p>HARRISBURG, Pa., Oct. 18 - A leading architect of the intelligent-design
movement defended his ideas in a federal courtroom on Tuesday and acknowledged
that under his definition of a scientific theory, astrology would fit as
neatly as intelligent design.</p>

Prof. Michael J. Behe of Lehigh University took questions after his second day
in court in Harrisburg, Pa., explaining intelligent design.
<td>
<p>Prof. Michael J. Behe, a biochemist at Lehigh University, is the first
expert witness for the school board of Dover, Pa., which is requiring students
to hear a statement about intelligent design in biology class.
<p>Under sharp cross-examination by a lawyer for parents who have sued the
school district, he said he was untroubled by the broadness of his definition
of science and likened intelligent design to the Big Bang theory of the
origins of the universe because both initially faced rejection from scientists
who objected for religious and philosophical reasons.
<p>"Intelligent design is certainly not the dominant view of the
scientific community," Professor Behe testified in Federal District
Court, "but I am very pleased with the progress we are making."
<p>Intelligent design is the belief that living organisms are so complex that
the best explanation is that they were created by an intelligent force of some
kind. At issue in the lawsuit is whether the concept's introduction into
biology class is an abridgment of the separation between church and state.
</table>
<p>The board voted last year to require that students in ninth-grade biology
listen to a four-paragraph statement saying that there are gaps and problems
with the theory of evolution and that intelligent design is among the
alternatives worth considering. The statement said that among the resources
available in the school library for further study is an intelligent-design
textbook, "Of Pandas and People."
<p>In two days on the stand, Professor Behe has insisted that intelligent
design is not the same as creationism, which supports the biblical view that
God created the earth and its creatures fully formed. The Supreme Court has
ruled that creationism is a religious belief and cannot be taught in public school.
<p>The cross-examination of Professor Behe on Tuesday made it clear that
intelligent-design proponents do not necessarily share the same definition of
their own theory. Eric Rothschild, a lawyer representing the parents suing the
school board, projected an excerpt from the "Pandas" textbook that said:
<p>"Intelligent design means that various forms of life began abruptly
through an intelligent agency with their distinctive features already intact,
fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers, beaks and wings, etc."
<p>In that definition, Mr. Rothschild asked, couldn't the words
"intelligent design" be replaced by "creationism" and
still make sense? Professor Behe responded that that excerpt from the textbook
was "somewhat problematic," and that it was not consistent with his
definition of intelligent design.
<p>Mr. Rothschild asked Professor Behe why then he had not objected to the
passage since he was among the scientists who was listed as a reviewer of the
book. Professor Behe said that although he had reviewed the textbook, he had
reviewed only the section he himself had written, on blood clotting. Pressed
further, he agreed that it was "not typical" for critical reviewers
of scientific textbooks to review their own work.
<p>Intelligent design, according to Professor Behe's definition, is a
scientific theory that is able to accept some aspects of evolution, like
change in organisms over time, but rejects the Darwinian theory of random
natural selection. He said intelligent design "focuses exclusively on the
proposed mechanism of how complex biological structures arose."
<p>Scientific critics of intelligent design - and there are many - have said
for years that its proponents never propose any positive arguments or proofs
of their theory, but rest entirely on finding flaws in evolution.
<p>In an attempt to pin Professor Behe down, Mr. Rothschild asked, "What
is the mechanism that intelligent design is proposing?"
<p>Mr. Behe said: "It does not propose a mechanism in the sense of a
step-by-step description of how these structures arose." He added that
"the word 'mechanism' can be used broadly" and said the mechanism
was "intelligent activity."
<p>Mr. Rothschild concluded, "Sounds pretty tautological, Professor Behe."
<p>"No, I don't think so," he responded. He likened the process to
seeing the sphinx in Egypt, or the stone heads on Easter Island, and concluding that
someone must have designed them.
<p>Listening from the front row of the courtroom, a school board member said
he found Professor Behe's testimony reaffirming. "Doesn't it sound like
he knows what he's talking about?" said the Rev. Ed Rowand, a board
member and church pastor.
<p>Mr. Rowand said the "core of the issue" is, "Do we have the
academic freedom to tell our children there are other points of view besides Darwin's?"
