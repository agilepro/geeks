<h2 align=center>Sam Harris & Objective Morality</h2>
Sam Harris argues that morality has to do with happiness and well-being of humans and other conscious beings. This is objective and can be quantified.
We can also determine what changes this happiness. Actions that increase this happiness are moral. Actions that decrease this happiness are immoral.<p>
For coming up with objective moral truths, I trust Sam far more than any gods or religious people. Science and philosophy can advance, while religions are stuck with old "holy" books often filled with torture and killing by the gods or in the name of the gods, and rules that decrease the happiness and
well-being of many people.<p>
Questions of good and evil, right and wrong are commonly thought unanswerable by science. But Sam argues that science can — and should — be an authority on moral issues, shaping human values and setting out what constitutes a good life. See his talk and article

<tr><td colspan=3><hr><h2 align=center><a href=FreeMind.htm><font color=#000077>Why Join an Atheist Organization?</h2></a>
In a 1999 poll, 48% of Americans said they would not consider voting for an atheist. Some dictionaries offer
an alternate definition of atheist as “wicked.” The Boy Scouts membership form says, “no member can grow into
the best kind of citizen without recognizing his obligation to God.”<p>
How are people supposed to know that atheists in fact do grow up to be the best kinds of American citizens every day
— if we aren't visible? Atheists of Silicon Valley is reclaiming the A-word in our community by encouraging local
atheists to come out of the closet and be open with friends, co-workers, neighbors and family. We're standing up and
speaking out. <a href=http://www.atheists.org/flash.line/atheist4.htm>14%</a> of Americans and
<a href=LINKS/Unchurched.htm>19%</a> of Californians identify themselves as some kind of non-believer.&nbsp; We may be a minority,
but we're sizable and growing.&nbsp; According to the American Religious Identification Survey, Americans who answered "none" when
asked to identify their religion numbered 29.4 million in 2001, more than double the 14.3 million in 1990.
</table><table><td><font color=#000077>
Don't be afraid of the A-word! If you're godless, concerned with the increasing god-talk in government and their
schemes to funnel our tax dollars toward religious projects, or just need a safe place to sound-off and tell your
religious jokes — then join us and experience how much you have in common with other atheists. We need your help.

<p>Atheism is the simple, logical conclusion based on the fact that there's not a single bit of reliable, empirical
evidence that any god exists — and certainly not the Christian god Yahweh.&nbsp; An atheist is one who has no
belief in any god or gods.&nbsp; We are an atheist organization founded by atheists for atheists.&nbsp; We want to live
religion-free lives and promote our U.S. Constitutional right of freedom from religion.&nbsp; We are affiliated with
<a href=http://www.atheists.org>American Atheists</a>, and are committed to:<UL>
<li>Defending the separation of government & religion, and the civil rights of atheists
<li>Promoting critical thinking, with science as our basis for knowledge<li>Understanding our love and compassion
<li>Promoting respect toward all Freethinkers<li>Educating the public about atheists & atheism
<li>Meeting other atheists for mutual learning and enjoyment</UL>
<p>NOTE: Most of us are not “geeks.”&nbsp; We've always considered our website’s name to be a little joke.<p>
