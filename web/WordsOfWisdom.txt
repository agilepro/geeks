I recently picked a new primary care physician. 
 
After two visits and exhaustive lab test, he said I was
doing "fairly well" for my age.

A little concerned about that comment, I couldn't
 resist asking him, "Do you think I'll live to be 80?"

 He asked, "well, do you smoke tobacco or drink beer or
 wine?" "Oh no", I replied. "I've never done either."

 Then he asked, "Do you eat rib-eye steaks and
 barbecued ribs?" I said, "No, I heard that all red
 meat is very unhealthy."

 "Do you spend a lot of time in the sun, like playing
 golf / sailing / ballooning / motorcycling / rock
 climbing?" "No I don't", I said.

 He said, "Do you gamble, drive fast cars, or sexually
 fool around?"
"No", I said. "I have never done any of those things."

 He looked at me and said, "Then why do you give a shit if you live to be 80?"
