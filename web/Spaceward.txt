45 years later, it is also time to investigate alternatives to rocket propulsion. Governed by the famous Rocket Equation, space-bound rockets must always be composed of at least 95% fuel, and will likely never carry more than 1% or 2% payload, so rocket travel will likely never be safe or affordable. The Space Elevator is the only viable alternative on the drawing boards today, offering very scalable, low-cost, and safe trasnsport to space.

45 years later, the Spaceward Foundation has set the goal of breaking the Space Program out of Earth Orbit and into worthy destinations. Mankind has clearly outgrew its habitat, and it's time to move on.
