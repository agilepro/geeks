“With respect to public acknowledgment of religious belief, it is entirely clear from our nation's historical
practices that the Establishment Clause permits this disregard of polytheists and believers in unconcerned

“...ideological rejection of God and an atheism of indifference, oblivious to the Creator and at risk of becoming equally

“Democracy demands that the religiously motivated translate their concerns into universal, rather than
religion-specific, values.&nbsp; It requires that their proposals be subject to argument, and amenable to reason.
I may be opposed to abortion for religious reasons, but if I seek to pass a law banning the practice, I cannot
simply point to the teachings of my church or evoke God's will.&nbsp; I have to explain why abortion violates some
principle that is accessible to people of all faiths, including those with no faith at all.”<br>

In a 1999 poll, 48% of Americans said they would not consider voting for an atheist. Some dictionaries offer
an alternate definition of atheist as “wicked.” The Boy Scouts membership form says, “no member can grow into
the best kind of citizen without recognizing his obligation to God.”<p>
How are people supposed to know that atheists in fact do grow up to be the best kinds of American citizens every day
— if we aren't visible? Atheists of Silicon Valley is reclaiming the A-word in our community by encouraging local
atheists to come out of the closet and be open with friends, co-workers, neighbors and family. We're standing up and
speaking out. <a href=http://www.atheists.org/flash.line/atheist4.htm>14%</a> of Americans and
<a href=LINKS/Unchurched.htm>19%</a> of Californians identify themselves as some kind of non-believer.&nbsp; We may be a minority,
but we're sizable and growing.&nbsp; According to the American Religious Identification Survey, Americans who answered "none" when
asked to identify their religion numbered 29.4 million in 2001, more than double the 14.3 million in 1990.
</table><table><td><font color=#000077>
Don't be afraid of the A-word! If you're godless, concerned with the increasing god-talk in government and their
schemes to funnel our tax dollars toward religious projects, or just need a safe place to sound-off and tell your
religious jokes — then join us and experience how much you have in common with other atheists. We need your help.

<p>Atheism is the simple, logical conclusion based on the fact that there's not a single bit of reliable, empirical
evidence that any god exists — and certainly not the Christian god Yahweh.&nbsp; An atheist is one who has no
belief in any god or gods.&nbsp; We are an atheist organization founded by atheists for atheists.&nbsp; We want to live
religion-free lives and promote our U.S. Constitutional right of freedom from religion.&nbsp; We are affiliated with
<a href=http://www.atheists.org>American Atheists</a>, and are committed to:<UL>
<li>Defending the separation of government & religion, and the civil rights of atheists
<li>Promoting critical thinking, with science as our basis for knowledge<li>Understanding our love and compassion
<li>Promoting respect toward all Freethinkers<li>Educating the public about atheists & atheism
<li>Meeting other atheists for mutual learning and enjoyment</UL>
<p>NOTE: Most of us are not “geeks.”&nbsp; We've always considered our website’s name to be a little joke.<p>
