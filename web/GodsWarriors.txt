<p><hr><H2>Tuesday - Thursday, 8/21-23, 9 pm: CNN Takes on God’s Warriors</h2>
The mainstream media is coming to life this month with a ground-breaking expose on religious extremism, titled “God’s Warriors”. This six hour documentary will be narrated by CNN’s Chief International Correspondent, Christiane Amanpour. Beginning August 21, and running for three consecutive nights, the program will explore Jewish, Muslim, and Christian extremism.<p>
The camera will focus on religious zealots of all shapes and sizes, who see themselves as god’s front line of defense against secular society. It will discuss religious intrusion into politics, and the battle for cultural supremacy.<p>
The third night’s focus will be on christianity, and will include footage of San Francisco’s own ‘Battle Cry’ event.  Several SF Atheists were interviewed, and are likely to be seen in the production. I believe the tenor of the program will portray religion in a very negative light, much the same as ‘Jesus Camp’ did.<p>
Wouldn’t it be nice if we could all wake up August 24th, and see a backlash AGAINST religion!!  It may not be that far fetched. Many Americans have had a belly full of religion at this point. What Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Chris Hitchens, (and soon, Dave Fitzgerald), are doing to expose religion in print, CNN might be starting a similar movement in
multimedia.<p>
So, grab your remote control, make a big bowl of popcorn, and prepared to be entertained. It should be three nights of television worth viewing.
