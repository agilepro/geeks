<p>WASHINGTON. On a recent evening, David Barton, a leading conservative
Christian advocate for emphasizing religion in American history, stood barefoot
on a bench in the rotunda of the United States Capitol Building with a
congressman by his side and about a hundred students from Oral Roberts
University at his feet.
<p>"Isn't it interesting that we have all been trained to recognize the two
least religious founding fathers?" Mr. Barton asked, pointing to Thomas
Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin in a painting on the wall. "And compared to
today's secularists these two guys look like a couple of Bible-thumping
evangelicals!" Even Jefferson signed letters "in the year of Our Lord
Christ," Mr. Barton told the group. "What would happen if George Bush
did that? They'd rip his head off!"
<p>Mr. Barton, who is also the vice chairman of the Texas Republican Party, is a
point man in a growing movement to call attention to the open Christianity of
America's great leaders and founding documents. The goal is to reverse what many
evangelical Christians claim is a secularist revision of history, to defend
displays of religion in public life and to make room for God in public school
classrooms.
<p>Their campaign and the liberal resistance have turned even the slightest
clues about the souls of the Republic's great leaders - that Washington left
church before communion and almost never referred to Jesus, that the famously
skeptical Jefferson attended Sunday services in the House of Representatives, or
that Lincoln never joined a church at all - into hotly contested turf in the
battle over the place of religion in public life. In a sign of his influence,
the California and Texas school boards have consulted Mr. Barton on their
curriculums. And sympathetic legislators in a dozen states have passed American
Heritage Education Acts intended to protect teachers who discuss religion's role
in history_- measures liberals call unnecessary.
<p>Mr. Barton, an expert witness in a case about the public display of the Ten
Commandments that is coming before the Supreme Court this week, said he has
given his "spiritual heritage" tour of the Capitol more than a hundred
times, for scores of Congressmen and thousands of visitors. The contents of
articles, books and videos produced by his organization, WallBuilders, about the
religious underpinnings of American history have echoed through Christian cable
networks, magazines and pulpits around the country.
<p>Custodians of historical sites testify to the currency of similar ideas. When
the Mount Vernon Estate and Museum sent out a recent fund-raising letter, for
example, "We got more calls on the subject of religion than any other
topic," mostly from evangelical Protestants encouraging more discussion of
Washington's faith, said James C. Rees, the museum's executive director.
<p>In response to the frequent questions, he said, the museum is installing a
replica of Washington's church pew and a video about his church attendance. It
is also asking the conservative thinker Michael Novak to write a book about
Washington and religion.
<p>But academic historians, including some conservative and evangelical
scholars, give the Christian conservative veneration of this history about a
B-minus. They say that Mr. Barton is more or less right, as far as it goes, that
the founders never guessed that courts would construe the First Amendment to
forbid public displays of religion like prayer in the schools. But the
18th-century religious views of the founders hardly fit into contemporary
categories like evangelical Protestant or secular humanist. Nor, historians say,
do the great leaders' public expressions of faith necessarily tell us much about
how their notion of an ideal relationship between religion and government.
<p>"Barton is a very hard-working researcher, but what I guess I worry
about is the collapsing of historical distance, and the effort to make really
anybody fit directly into the category of the early 21st century
evangelicals," said Mark A. Noll, a prominent historian at Wheaton College,
a prestigious evangelical school.
<p>But, Professor Noll added, "I would say he is no worse than some of the
Ivy League types who do the same thing, who say the founding fathers believed in
separation of church and state and therefore we do, too."
<p>Gordon Wood, a professor at Brown and historian of early America, agreed that
the founders never imagined a culture as secular as ours. After all, many states
had tax-supported churches well into the 19th century. "They definitely did
not contemplate this kind of what we might call 'extreme,' where a minister or a
rabbi at a public school graduation is considered to be a violation of
separation of church and state," Professor Wood said. "We have built
that wall much higher than any of them, even Jefferson, would have
anticipated."
<p>But he said educated colonials like the founders also took a dim view of
religious fervor. "They just were not in favor of religious 'enthusiasms' -
that is the word they would have used for what we would call evangelical,"
he said.
<p>Richard Brookhiser, a biographer of Washington and a senior editor at the
conservative National Review, put it differently. "The temperature of a lot
of 18th century religion was just a lot lower," he said.
<p>But debates over the spirituality of America's most inspirational leaders are
as old as the nation itself; in the early Republic, newspapers published
accounts of leaders' dying moments in part to assess their readiness to meet
their maker.
<p>"People care passionately about the founders because they want the
founders to be like them," Mr. Brookhiser said. "So you get this from
Christians, and you get it from secularists who say the founders are like them
and want them to be 'closet deists.' " His own view: "They probably
couldn't conceive that the country could ever change so much. But, look, if they
wanted a Christian state they could have done it. They were writing the rules.
They could have put God in the rules."
<p>The secularists Mr. Brookhiser refers to - self-described religious skeptics
- make the omission of "the Creator" from the Constitution the
cornerstone of their view of the Republic. In "Freethinkers: A History of
American Secularism" (Metropolitan), Susan Jacoby argued it could hardly
have been an accident. The Rev. John M. Mason of New York, a Christian champion
of the 1780's, for example, argued that God's absence was "an omission
which no pretext can palliate" and warned that if Americans proved equally
godless "we have every reason to tremble." But he was unsuccessful.
<p>Each side can find ammunition for its perspective in almost any great
historical figure or moment. Newt Gingrich, the former House Speaker, notes in
his recently published book "Winning the Future" (Regnery) that the
relative skeptic Benjamin Franklin suggested that the Constitutional Convention
hire a chaplain. But what Mr. Gingrich leaves out is that the convention
declined to do so, in part for lack of funds and in part because the
participants worried that turning to prayer in the middle of their debates might
signal to the public that they were in trouble.
<p>Forrest McDonald, a professor emeritus at the University of Alabama and a
conservative critic of what he sees as liberal political correctness in history
departments, said that, all in all, Christians probably outnumbered deists among
the founders. Even so, he said, "Just because the founders were a Christian
nation and just because they expected it to be a Christian nation doesn't tell
us anything about what we should do today."
<p>As Mr. Barton strolled the Capitol with his escort, Representative Bob
Beauprez, Republican of Colorado, the first stop on his tour was inside the
Capitol dome, where a mural depicts "The Apotheosis of George
Washington," in which the first president sits in the clouds surrounded by
angels. Representative Rush Holt, Democrat of New Jersey, stopped to listen as
he crossed paths with the tour.
<p>"You don't get tour guides like this around here very often, and I had
to stop and listen," Mr. Holt told the students. "You all are lucky to
get to hear him."
<p>Standing before a painting of Washington with his hand outstretched, Mr.
Barton read from the best-known testament that the first president was indeed a
heartfelt Christian: his "prayer for America" from his letter of
resignation as a general, urging citizens to imitate "the Characteristicks
of the Divine Author of our Blessed Religion." "He's saying, hey, we
have won the war but if we don't imitate Christ we won't be a happy
nation," Mr. Barton said. "That is Washington!"
<p>Other historians, though, say that letter was one of the only times
Washington referred to Jesus at all. Instead, he more often spoke of a divine
"Providence" that established the laws of nature and deserved thanks
for favorable events. He was an active member of the Masons, who emphasized
enlightenment ideas about reason and natural law, and swore his oath of office
on a Bible borrowed from a Masonic lodge.
<p>Mr. Barton says that after Washington's death, religious members of his
family testified in great detail to a personal faith hidden from the public. But
Joseph J. Ellis, a professor at Mount Holyoke and Pulitzer Prize-winning
biographer whose latest book is "His Excellency: George Washington"
(Knopf), calls him "a lukewarm Episcopalian and a quasi-deist."
"When he died he really did not know what would happen to his soul, if such
a thing existed," he added.
<p>Washington's opposition to establishing or even favoring any religion,
though, was clear. In 1790, for example, he wrote to a Jewish synagogue in Rhode
Island to say that in America all faiths were not only tolerated but fully
equal: "It is now no more that toleration is spoken of as if it was the
indulgence of one class of people that another enjoyed the exercise of their
inherent natural rights."
<p>Jefferson's cosmology was a matter of debate in his own lifetime, when his
political opponents denounced him as an atheist. But Mr. Barton told his
students that "even Jefferson" called himself a Christian. Jefferson
approved the use of the Capitol and other public buildings for church services
and attended himself, even enlisting the military band to play religious music.
And in 1803, Mr. Barton said, he signed a treaty that called for public funds to
pay a missionary to the Indians.
<p>But Jefferson was also the most forthright deist among the founders, meaning
that he believed in a creator who merely set the world in motion according to
natural laws. When Thomas Paine wrote "The Age of Reason," an attack
on organized religion, Jefferson was virtually the only founder who remained his
friend.
<p>Jefferson famously assembled his own Bible by cutting out any passage
involving miracles or the supernatural to leave only Jesus's teachings. In a
letter to John Adams in 1823, Jefferson defended his faith by arguing that true
Christians followed these teachings, while belief in miracles like the virgin
birth perverted them.
<p>On the other hand, Mr. Brookhiser noted, Jefferson took time to prepare his
own Bible. "A modern secular humanist would not do that," he said.
<p>In a later era, a young Lincoln was pilloried as irreligious too. He was
known to have devoured the works of skeptics like Paine, and he was never
baptized, never joined a church, and never or rarely mentioned Jesus.
<p>"One would have a very hard time saying he was a believing
Christian," said Thomas F. Schwartz, the Illinois state historian and
director of research at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, and
a member of the theologically conservative Missouri Synod of the Lutheran
Church. Christians have sometimes retold stories that Lincoln had a "secret
baptism," but "they take you up blind allies or into rabbit
holes," Mr. Schwartz said.
<p>"His wife said he was not a technical Christian but he was a man of
faith," Mr. Schwartz said.
<p>But Lincoln knew his Bible. His speeches overflowed with Bible verses,
including some like "a house divided against itself cannot stand" that
are now better known as Lincoln verses than Bible verses. He had "the
cadences of the King James Bible in his lungs," as Mr. Brookhiser put it.
<p>After the death of a son, he took comfort from a Presbyterian minister, and
during the ravages of the Civil War, he took his questions to God. In 1862 he
wrote a private essay, "Meditation on the Divine Will." Some of its
ideas ended up in his Second Inaugural Address about an unfathomable God who
"gives to both North and South this terrible war."
<p>Professor Noll argued that Lincoln's religious oratory shifted from mere
metaphors or window dressing to substantive statements about the will of God.
"He moves during his lifetime from being a kind of secular fatalist toward
being something closer to a Christian," Professor Noll said.
<p>How such nuances are conveyed in textbooks and popular histories is Mr.
Barton's watch. Ever alert to the treatment of religion, he recently posted an
article on his group's Web site (<a href="http://wallbuilders.com" target="_">wallbuilders.com</a>),
"Revisionism: How to Identify It in Your Children's Textbooks,"
listing some quotations from a best-seller, "Don't Know Much About
History," by Kenneth C. Davis. Mr. Barton found what he considered several
significant omissions.
<p>For example, Mr. Davis quoted Patrick Henry's famous cry: "Is life so
dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery?
Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take, but as for me,
give me liberty or give me death!" But the phrase "Forbid it, Almighty
God!" was left out.
<p>Asked about the quotation, Mr. Davis said any such elision was an accident
made in the interest of brevity, not to censor religion. He noted that he
included a reference to God in another quotation, one from William Bradford,
governor of the Plymouth Colony, describing Indians being burned alive after a
battle: "horrible was the stincke and sente there of, but the victory
seemed a sweet sacrifice, and they gave the prayers thereof to God."
<p>"Sure, God shows up on the bad stuff," Mr. Barton said in an
interview. "We don't hear much about the five revivals in American history,
but we always hear about the Salem witch trials." Still, he said, he only
sought to dust off the fact of the founders' Christianity, not to argue for or
against it. "If we are arguing off the premise that we have to be secular
today because we have always been secular," he said, "then we are
arguing off the wrong premise."
