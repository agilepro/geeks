- Documentary video on the disappearance of Madalyn Murray O'Hair.</H3>
They will feature a documAtheentary video on the disappearance of Madalyn Murray O'Hair. MMOH, as she is known to many of us, founded American Atheists, and inspired Atheists to stand up for their rights for over thirty years. She first became known for her successful Supreme Court case that outlawed prayer in public schools. Later she made many appearances on TV talk shows, and never hesitated to bluntly say what she thought of religion.<p>
When she and her family disappeared in the mid nineties, along with the funds from American Atheists bank accounts, the theists bragged that this only demonstrated that morality was impossible without religion. Even some Atheists who disliked MMOH's personal style joined in the accusations of theft of the organization's funds.<p>
The gruesome truth was uncovered years later; the entire family was kidnapped for ransom, and when the kidnappers got their money, everyone was murdered.<p>
Several other short video clips will also be shown.<p>
