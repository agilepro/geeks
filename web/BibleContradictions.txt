<h1>Contradictions in the Bible</h1>
</div><hr><p>
In Matthew, Jesus was born during the reign of Herod the Great, who died in 4 B.C. (Matthew 2:1)<br>
Luke claims that Jesus was born during the first census in Israel, which took place ten years after Herod's death
(Luke 2:12).<p>

In Matthew, Mary and Joseph live in Bethlehem (Mathew 2:11).<br>
In Luke, Mary and Joseph live in greater metropolitan Nazareth (Luke 2:4).<p>

In Matthew, Jesus is born in a house (Matthew 2:11).<br>
In Luke, Jesus is born in a manger (Luke 2:7).<p>

In Matthew, after Jesus is born, the family immediately flees to Egypt (Matthew 2:13).<br>
In Luke, they take a leisurely trip to Jerusalem to sacrifice birds (Luke 2:22-24).<p>

Matthew 12:40, For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three
days and three nights in the heart of the earth. (Friday night, Saturday night, ???)<p>

Isaiah 40:28 says, "...the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is he weary."<br>
If this is true, why did God rest on the seventh day?<p>

How did Jesus ascend to heaven in the flesh when Paul says that flesh cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven?
(1 Cor.15:50)<p>

If God was Jesus' father (not Joseph), then why is Jesus' family tree traced through Joseph?
Matthew and Luke can't even agree on the name of Joseph's father.<p>

<hr><p>

Christ said, in Matthew 10:34-36. "Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to
bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a
daughter-in-law against her motherinlaw — a man's enemies will be the members of his own household."<p>

Christ also said, in Luke 9:56, "For the Son of Man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them."<p> 

<hr><p>

In Genesis 32:30 Jacob says he saw God face to face.<br>
In John 1:18 Christ says, "No man hath seen God at anytime."<p>

<hr><p>

We can read in 11 Kings 2:11 that Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.<br>
In John 3:13 Christ says, "No man hath ascended up to heaven."<p>

<hr><p>

Matthew 28:19-20, where Christ instructed them with, "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in
the name of the Father, and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost. Teaching them to observe all things, whatsoever I
have commanded, even unto the end of the world. Amen."<p>

Matthew 10:5, "These 12 Jesus sent forth, and commanded them saying. Go not into the way of the Gentile, and
into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not."<p>

<hr><p>

It would be difficult to know if you should or shouldn't with this contradiction.<p>

Matthew 26:52, "All they that take the sword shall perish with the sword."<br>

Luke 22:36, "He that hath no sword, let him sell his garments and buy one."<p>

<hr><p>

Mark 10:21 
Then Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, "One thing you lack: Go your way, sell whatever you have
and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, take up the cross and follow Me."<p>

NOTE: Jesus obviously hadn't been crucified yet, so the cross metaphor is not applicable.<p>

<hr><p>

Matthew 1:18-21, The Annunciation occurred after Mary had conceived Jesus.<br>
Luke 1:26-31, It occurred before conception.<p>

<hr><p>

Matthew 6:13, Jesus' prayer implies that God might lead us into temptation.<br>

nor does he tempt anyone;<p>

In Job 7:9 we learn, "As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away, so he that goeth down to the grave shall
come up no more."<br>

And in Isaiah 26:14, "They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise."<br>

John 5:28-29. "Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear
his voice, And shall come forth; they that have done good unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done
evil, unto the resurrection of damnation."<p>
