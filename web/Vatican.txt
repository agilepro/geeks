the Vatican is a foreign govt, making all the Catholic priests agents of that foreign govt.  Their hands are very bloody, historically -- having killed millions.


I see no reason to post this, as I disagree with the statements that Catholic League president William Donohue made.  I also see no reason not to use " 'towering energy and intellect' to bash Catholicism," if that's what I think that they deserve (and I often do think so).

It's an interesting question, "Which is worse, Catholicism or Communism?"  I think that they both encourage people to do good and evil acts.  They both have a bloody hstory.
