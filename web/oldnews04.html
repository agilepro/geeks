- "Free Will vs. Determinism: Is Free Will the 'god' of the Atheists?"<br>by Thomas Crawford</h3>
While Atheists will steadfastly deny the existence of an all-powerful supernatural entity living in the sky or
among them, many believe in an equivalent that resides in their heads. This presentation offered
the determinist position that, while consistent with scientific and logical methods, is often vehemently
rejected by almost everyone, Atheist and religious alike.<p>
Thomas was the vice-president of the San Diego Atheist Coalition before moving up to San Jose last year.
He gave this talk to the San Diego group and a stimulating debate followed. He has a PhD in clinical
psychology from the University of Connecticut and is a child psychologist with Kaiser Permanente. Thomas will
use examples from research findings in developmental psychopathology to support his claim that we are what our
parents and the world make us <b>and will make us.</b>"
<p><hr><H3>Wednesday, Sept. 22, 2004, 7:30 pm in Mtn. View - Diane Wilson spoke about her life and her book<br>
<a href=http://www.dianewilson.net/>Awakening of a Jehovah's Witness: Escape From the Watchtower Society</a></H3>
<h4>ONE OF THE SEASON'S MOST PSYCHOLOGICALLY ASTUTE BOOKS</h4>
Who are those polite, well-scrubbed Jehovah's Witnesses who appear at our doors to hand out leaflets and offer
to discuss the Bible? Diane Wilson, made vulnerable by a childhood of psychological abuse, succumbed to the
group's charms and remained a member for 25 years. Wilson describes the indoctrination process, the hypocrisy,
and the gradual suppression of individuality. Much of what she describes might be said of any cult, and members
of mainstream religions may come to see the dangers of fanaticism in their own faiths.<p>

How To Achieve More by Separating the Science of Success from Self-Help Snake Oil</H3>
by Dr. Stephen Kraus<p>"Positive psychology" is the scientific study of happy, successful people,
and it's one of the fastest growing fields in psychology. Success scientist
and Harvard Ph.D. Stephen Kraus utilizes this research to offer proven,
practical tools for achieving more, while debunking self-help snake oil and
unmasking self-improvement urban legends. Dr. Kraus has been called a

psychology of success, and is the author of "Psychological Foundations of
Success: A Harvard-Trained Scientist Separates the Science of Success from
Self-Help Snake Oil."

Atheists of Silicon Valley lead a protest against the National Day of Prayer event, as we have for the last three years.
This is a federally-funded annual abuse of the Constitution.<p>
We had signs to hold up, and pamphlets to hand out. There were plenty of xtian highschoolers who get the time off to
come to this, and were at least nominally interested in an alternative view. We helped open their minds.<p>
After all this fun, we retired to the nearby Togo's for food and refreshment.<p>
See Joe Mercado's <a href=NDOP2004.htm>write-up</a> of the event.<p>Location:<br>801 N. 1st St.<br>San Jose

<p><hr><H3>Wednesday, April 14, 2004, 7:30pm, in Mtn. View - Report on the American Atheists' National Convention</H3>
<p><hr><H3>Saturday, April 3, 2004, 3 - 5 pm: EAST BAY ATHEISTS - "The Evolution Controversy"</h3>
Glenn Branch, Deputy Director of National Center for Science Education, Inc., was the speaker this month. "Nothing in biology makes sense except in light of evolution," Theodosius Dobzhansky once said. Yet, from the Scopes trial to the January 2004 exclusion of the "e-word" from a proposed set of state science standards in Georgia, opposition to evolution education continues to be strong. Come hear Glenn talk about the motivations, tactics, and prospects of antievolutionism.<p>

<p><hr><H3>Wednesday, March 24, 2004, 11 AM - noon: Rally in Support of the Secular Pledge of Allegiance<br>
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals<br>7th and Mission Streets, San Francisco</h3>
This was in conjunction with American Atheists' rally on the steps of the Supreme Court that
day to support Michael Newdow as he argued before the court against inclusion of the phrase "under god"
in the Pledge.<p>Featured speakers were:<br>
- Dave Kong, California State Director for American Atheists<br>
- Bobbie Kirkhart, Atheist Alliance, International<br>
- Dave Fitzgerald, San Francisco Atheists<br>
- Larry Hicok, East Bay Atheists<br>
- Mark Thomas<font color=#FFEEFF>x</font>
Atheists of Silicon Valley and Godless Americans PAC<br>
- Ray Westergard, East Bay chapter of Americans United for Separation of Church and State<br>
- Mynga Kutrell, Sacramento Atheists and Other Freethinkers<br>- Jim Heldberg,
American Atheists National Affiliation Director (leading the crowd in the secular version of the Pledge)<p><b>Most importantly, we had people show up and let the world know that this is important to us. We can't change everyone, and we can change ourselves by participating.</b><p>Here is what Larry Hicok wrote:<p>In the 1960's Madalyn Murray won a historic Supreme Court ruling against prayer in public schools. It appeared that the hypocrisy surrounding government support of religion was on the way out.<p>Today the exact opposite is happening. Our beloved President's father has said that Atheists should not be considered citizens. His record in office is far more secular than his son's. Atheists are compelled to do everything possible to counter the foul stench of government-sponsored fundamentalism that threatens to strip them of their rights.<p>Newdow's suit against god in the Pledge is possibly the most significant challenge to this cancer since Madalyn's historic suit. It challenges an addition to the Pledge that happened in the days of McCarthyism, when the concepts underlying our Constitution were least respected. It strikes at the very roots of "Ceremonial Deism" that the courts have hidden behind to rationalize the god nonsense in government.<p>We must act. Please join us.<p>AP Photo Pictures of the San Francisco rally:<br>

<p><hr><H3>Wednesday, March 10, 2004, 7:30 pm: Video: HELL HOUSE</H3>Documentary<br>
Every October since 1990, the Pentecostal Assemblies of God Church in Cedar Hill, Texas, has created, constructed
and scripted a large, elaborate haunted house, open to the public. But Hell House is not the usual collection of
ghosts and goblins; rather, it exposes visitors to the apparent evils of the real world and then offers a chance
for salvation. George Ratliff's eye-opening documentary chronicles the organization of one Hell House from
brainstorming sessions, through auditions for high-school actors (with female students vying for roles as repentant
abortion seekers) to the presentation of the vignettes - in which a naive raver is drugged and raped, a gay man is
sentenced to eternity in Hell and a classroom is the venue for a bloody massacre. Treating his subject delicately,
showing respect for his subjects and maintaining an air of objectivity, Ratliff presents a congregation of essentially regular people earnestly attempting to increase church attendance through fear. Winner of the Golden Gate Award at the 2002 San Francisco International Film Festival. TV14 (AC, AL, V) () Color (86 mins)<p>
There was also be a 10 minute taped interview with Michael Newdow, who is challenging "under God" in the pledge of allegiance.<p>Thanks to Zon Powers.<p>

<p><hr><H3>Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2004 - 7:30 PM, in Mtn. View - Atheist Video Nite</h3>We watched a video of Barry Lynn, of <a href=http://www.au.org>Americans United for Separation of Church & State</a>, talking about the religious right.<p>Thanks to David Mandell for the video.<p>
