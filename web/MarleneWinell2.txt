<hr><H2>August 8-10, RELEASE and RECLAIM: Retreat for those leaving their religion<br>- in Berkeley</h2>
* Leaving your Religion? *<br>* Or still feeling the effects? *<br>* It's not the end of the world! *<br>
* Join us for a powerful weekend with others who can understand. *<p>
This is a supportive program for those wanting to let go of toxic beliefs
and recover from an authoritarian religion such as Christian fundamentalism.
We'll rant and rave, tell our stories, discuss the issues, visualize,
role-play, dance and draw -- whatever it takes to think for ourselves and
reclaim our lives. A joyful empowered life is your birthright and you can
start now.<p>This retreat will be led by Dr. Marlene Winell, author of *Leaving the
Fold: A Guide for Former Fundamentalists and Others Leaving the Fold. * Dr.
