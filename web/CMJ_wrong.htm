If You're a Christian, Muslim or Jew - You are Wrong</a></h1>

<p>We live in a twisted world, where right is wrong and wrong reigns supreme. It
is a chilling fact that most of the world's leaders believe in nonsensical
fairytales about the nature of reality. They believe in gods that do not exist,
and religions that could not possibly be true. We are driven to war after war,
violence on top of violence to appease madmen who believe in gory mythologies.
<p>These men are called Christians, Muslims and Jews.
<p>Osama bin Laden is insane. He believes God whispered in the ear of Mohammed
1,400 years ago about how he should conquer Arabia. Mohammed was a pure
charlatan -- and a good one at that. He makes present religious frauds like Pat
Robertson look like amateurs.
<p>He said God told him to have sex with as many of the women he met as
possible. I'm sorry, I meant to say "take them as wives." God told him
to kill all other tribes that stood in his way or that would not placate him
with assurances of loyalty or bribes. God told him, conveniently, that everyone
should follow him and never question a word he said.
<p>He sold this bag of goods to the blithering idiots who lived in the Arabian
Peninsula at the time. If that weren't shockingly stupid enough, over a billion
people continue to believe the convenient lies that Mohammed told all that time
ago -- to this very day.
<p>We live in a world full of insane people. Sanity is an island battered in an
ocean of frothing delusion. The people who believe in science are the minority.
The people who believe in bloody fairytales are the overwhelming majority.
<p>George W. Bush is the most powerful man alive. He is a class A imbecile. He
is far less intelligent than the average Christian. But like most of the others,
he believes Jesus died for his sins. That idea is so perverse and devoid of
logic it should shock the conscience. Instead, it gets him elected, and earns
him the reverence of a great percentage of America. America! The most advanced
country in the world -- run by a bunch of villagers who still believe Santa
Claus is going to save them.
<p>There is no fucking Easter Bunny. There is no Jesus waiting to return. Moses
never even existed. These were all convenient lies from the men of those times
to gain power. Their actions were rational -- they wanted to deceive their
brethren so that they could amass power. I get their motivations. But I cannot,
for the life of me, understand our motivations, thousands of years later, still
following the conmen of yesteryear into our gory, bloody, violent end.
<p>Jesus is said to have said on the cross, "My God, My God, why have you
forsaken me?" Because Jesus was insane and the God he thought would rescue
him did not exist. And he died on that cross like a fool. He fancied himself the
son of God and he could barely convince twelve men to follow him at a time when
the world was full of superstition.
<p>Excellent marketing by some of his followers would later rescue his botched
effort. How many people saw his miracles? One? Twelve? Eighty? Why didn't he
show the whole world? Not because this is some giant pop quiz by God to test us
-- but because he did not perform any miracles!
<p>Even his apostles can't agree on what miracles he supposedly carried out or
when he carried them out. Or whether he returned after death or he didn't.
Whether they saw him in person or just as a vision. Rational human beings
shouldn't believe this kind of nonsense. Yet most of the world does.
<p>If a man today killed his only son to show how much he loved other people, he
would be considered a madman, locked in jail and earn society's contempt. Yet we
think this is some sort of noble act by our Father in Heaven.
<p>In Heaven? What, with the harps and the winged angels and the 72 virgins? My
God, how stupid do you have to be to believe that?
<p>I know most of you don't actually read your religious texts, and when you do,
you assiduously try to avoid the parts that make no sense whatsoever or hide
underneath the comforting grasp of your religious leaders who have concocted a
bunch of circular logic (a crime to even use that word in regards to
Christianity, Islam or Judaism) to shield you from the obvious folly of the
written text.
<p>So, I'm not calling you stupid if you haven't really read the material. And I
know how powerful brainwashing is. We all received it when we were young and it
is exceedingly difficult to break its grasp. But people dance around the issue
out of politeness because they don't want to call you what you are -- ignorant.
<p>There are a lot of people I love dearly and respect wholeheartedly who
believe in religion. I hate to do this to them. But we have killed far too many
people, wasted far too much time on this nonsense for us to keep going in this
direction for fear of offense.
<p>Jesus was a lunatic. God is not coming to your rescue. He hasn't come to
anyone's rescue in thousands of years, including Jesus. Mohammed was a power
hungry scam artist and ruthless conqueror. Moses and Abraham were figments of
the imagination some long dead rabbi. He would probably laugh his ass off at all
of you who still believe the fairytales he made up thousands of years ago. He
probably wouldn't even believe it if you told him.
<p>Did I mention Judaism? The chosen people? Come on, get off it. People walk
around in clothes from 18th century Russia, thinking they have been chosen by
God when they look like a bunch of jackasses. I'm tired of all the deaths
because we did not want to give offense. Orthodox Jews are wrong and ridiculous.
<p>As are the orthodox and fundamentalists of all of the religions. It says in
the Bible that it is an abomination to wear clothes made of two different cloths
or to eat shellfish. If you think God will hate you because you mixed wool and
linen or because you ate some shrimp, you are insane.
<p>How long are we going to dance around the 800-pound gorilla in the room? The
world is run by madmen. It's not just Bush and bin Laden. It is the leader of
all of the countries in the Middle East, almost all of the Americas and most of
the rest of the world.
<p>Have I offended you? That's too bad. Stop killing each other in the name of
false and ridiculous gods and I will stop ridiculing you. Trust me, your offense
is much worse than mine.
<p>Right now as you read this, there are ignorant, hateful Muslims teaching
other ignorant Muslims how to put on a suicide belt. There are orthodox Jews
telling other Jews how they must never leave their "holy land" no
matter what the consequences are to other human beings. They assure their
followers -- remember, they are not the chosen ones, we are. If we crush and
oppress them, don't worry, God will excuse it, and even desires it, because He
is on our side.
<p>There are maniacal Christians who are praying for the end of time. Who are
hoping that most of the world's population is wiped off the face of the Earth by
their vengeful and murderous God. Whom they believe is, ironically, a loving
God. Unless, of course, you make the fatal mistake of not kissing his ass and
appeasing him, in which case he will slaughter you and condemn you to eternal
torture. What kind of sick people believe this?
<p>The kind who live next to you. The kind who voted for George Bush. The kind
who send their religious leaders to the White House to argue against
even-handedness in the Middle East because it would prevent their sick prophecy.
The kind who have undue influence over how we use the greatest and most lethal
army ever built by man.
<p>If you don't want to be called ignorant or misinformed, then get informed.
Learn the real nature of our universe and put aside old wives' tales about
resurrected gods, omniscient prophets and a guy who could split the Red Sea but
couldn't find where he's going in the desert for forty years.
<p>It's the year 2005. Let's start acting like it.<p>
