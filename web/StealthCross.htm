<h3>Signals from above</h3>

<br>
To Christians, the cross is a symbol of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
A proposal to transform that symbol atop a Methodist church in<br>
Schaumburg IL, however, is grounded in a more secular belief: good<br>
cellular reception.<br>
<br>
Sprint PCS has offered to pay Our Redeemer's Methodist Church an<br>
undisclosed amount of money to encase a cellular antenna inside the<br>
church cross, which towers atop the house of worship.<br>
<br>
Called a "stealth" antenna, Sprint will replace the church's present<br>
cross with a new fiberglass one that has the antenna built inside.<br>
<br>
The church is at Springinsguth and Schaumburg roads.<br>
<br>
It's a new twist on a growing trend called "stealthing" used by<br>
cellular companies to locate antennas where they can improve the<br>
signal, said Mark McHale, regional communications director for Sprint<br>
PCS wireless division.<br>
<br>
A church cross is the latest stealth tactic, but they've already<br>
found places inside flagpoles, high school football stadium lights<br>
and, in some parts of the United States, inside evergreen trees,<br>
McHale said.<br>
<br>
If the deal goes through, the Schaumburg cross would go up sometime<br>
next year, becoming what McHale believes would be the first of its<br>
kind in the Chicago area.<br>
<br>
The new cross will be the same height as the existing cross, but 6<br>
inches wider. It would also give the church a little facelift, as the<br>
current metal cross is beginning to show signs of rust.<br>
<br>
The antenna is 12 inches long, but would be built inside the new<br>
cross -- invisible to passers-by. Graphite would allow for the<br>
signals to be transmitted.<br>
<br>
Sprint would also pay to lease a small space adjacent to the church<br>
building for a brick-enclosed bay station, equipment needed on the<br>
site.<br>
<br>
Why did Sprint go after this particular church?<br>
<br>
"That location and that site helps extend the network coverage in<br>
Chicago," McHale said. "If you want to build it over from Chicago to<br>
Aurora, we needed a site there to continue with the coverage in<br>
Schaumburg."<br>
<br>
Church leaders were intrigued by the idea because Sprint is offering<br>
to replace the old cross and pay money besides -- revenue needed for<br>
church programs.<br>
<br>
However, the Rev. Bill Shaw, senior pastor at Our Redeemer, said the<br>
deal is not set in stone.<br>
<br>
Church leaders signed a contract with Sprint more than a year ago,<br>
but as the company took a second look at how it would fit into its<br>
cellular network, it expired. Now Sprint is showing interest again,<br>
and Schaumburg planning officials say the plans could go before the<br>
board as early as this fall.<br>
<br>
The church's initial decision over whether to allow the placing of an<br>
antenna inside a cross wasn't an easy one. Church members voted in<br>
favor of the antenna only after a long discussion, Shaw said.<br>
<br>
"There were practical concerns as well as theological," he said.<br>
<br>
Driving the decision was bringing more money to church programs, Shaw<br>
said.<br>
<br>
"It would bring funds for the ministry. That's a big part of what we<br>
do, we do ministry," he said.<br>
<br>
The fact that the antenna would bring funds to the church is an<br>
appealing point in its favor, said Linda Rhodes, director of<br>
communications for the Northern Illinois Conference of the United<br>
Methodist Church.<br>
<br>
Rhodes said she wishes her church in Naperville would take that route.<br>
<br>
"My personal opinion is it's smart," she said. "Nobody said<br>
Christians are supposed to check their brains at the door."<br>
<br>
"(The cross) is a symbol, it is not sacred in and of itself. There is<br>
all kinds of steel, cement and brick holding up the cross. This is<br>
just another piece of metal."<br>
<br>
From a larger community perspective, the stealth antenna is a nicer-<br>
looking alternative to cellular towers, said Schaumburg planner Tom<br>
Farace. With cell phones continuing to increase in popularity and<br>
numbers, and residents commonly complaining about unsightly cell<br>
towers, the stealth antennas are a good substitute.<p>
