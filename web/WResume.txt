Washington, DC 20520

EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE:

Law Enforcement:  
Ø      I was arrested in Kennebunkport, Maine, in 1976 for driving under 
the influence of alcohol. I pled guilty, paid a fine, and had my driver's 
license suspended for 30 days. My Texas driving record has been "lost"
and is not available.

Military:  
Ø      I joined the Texas Air National Guard and went AWOL. I refused to 
take a drug test or answer any questions about my drug use. By joining the 
Texas Air National Guard, I was able to avoid combat duty in Vietnam.

College:  
Ø      I graduated from Yale University with a low C average. I was a cheerleader.  


Past Work Experience:
Ø      I ran for U.S. Congress and lost. I began my career in the oil 
business in Midland, Texas, in 1975. I bought an oil company, but couldn't 
find any oil in Texas. The company went bankrupt shortly after I sold all my 
stock. I bought the Texas Rangers baseball team in a sweetheart deal that 
took land using taxpayer money. With the help of my father and our friends 
in the oil industry (including Enron CEO Ken Lay), I was elected governor of Texas.

ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS GOVERNOR OF TEXAS:  
         - I changed Texas pollution laws to favor power and oil companies, 
           making Texas the most polluted state in the Union. During my tenure, Houston 
           replaced Los Angeles as the most smog-ridden city in America.
         - I cut taxes and bankrupted the Texas treasury to the tune of 
           billions in borrowed money.  
         - I set the record for the most executions by any governor in American history.  
         - With the help of my brother, the governor of Florida, and my father's appointments
           to the Supreme Court, I became President after losing by over 500,000 votes.

ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS PRESIDENT:  
         - I am the first President in U.S. history to enter office with a criminal record.  
         - I invaded and occupied two countries at a continuing cost of over one billion dollars per week.  
         - I spent the U.S. surplus and effectively bankrupted the U.S. Treasury.  
         - I shattered the record for the largest annual deficit in U.S. history.  
         - I set an economic record for most private bankruptcies filed in any 12-month period.  
         - I set the all-time record for most foreclosures in a 12-month period.  
         - I set the all-time record for the biggest drop in the history of 
           the U.S. stock market. In my first year in office, over 2 million Americans 
           lost their jobs and that trend continues every month.  
         - I'm proud that the members of my cabinet are the richest of any 
           administration in U.S. history. My "poorest millionaire," Condoleeza Rice, 
           has a Chevron oil tanker named after her.  
         - I set the record for most campaign fund-raising trips by a U.S. President.  
         - I am the all-time U.S. and world record-holder for receiving the most corporate campaign donations.  
         - My largest lifetime campaign contributor, andone of my best friends, Kenneth Lay,
           presided over the largest corporate bankruptcy fraud in U.S. History, Enron.  
         - My political party used Enron private jets and corporate 
           attorneys to assure my success with the U.S. Supreme Court during my election decision.  
         - I have protected my friends at Enron and Halliburton against 
           investigation or prosecution. More time and money was spent investigating the Monica
           Lewinsky affair than has been spent investigating one of the biggest corporate rip-offs
           in history. I presided over the biggest energy crisis in U.S. history and refused to
           intervene when corruption involving the oil industry was revealed.  
         - I presided over the highest gasoline prices in U.S. history.  
         - I changed the U.S. policy to allow convicted criminals to be awarded government contracts.  
         - I appointed more convicted criminals to administration than any President in U.S. history.  
         - I created the Ministry of Homeland Security, the largest bureaucracy in the history of
           the United States government.  
         - I've broken more international treaties than any President in U.S. history.  
         - I am the first President in U.S. history to have the United 
           Nations remove the U.S. from the Human Rights Commission.  
         - I withdrew the U.S. from the World Court of Law.  
         - I refused to allow inspector's access to U.S. "prisoners of war" 
           detainees and thereby have refused to abide by the Geneva Convention.  
         - I am the first President in history to refuse United Nations 
           election inspectors (during the 2002 U.S. election).
         - I set the record for fewest numbers of press conferences of any 
           President since the advent of television.  
         - I set the all-time record for most days on vacation in any 
           one-year period. After taking off the entire month of August, I presided 
           over the worst security failure in U.S. history.  
         - I garnered the most sympathy ever for the U.S. after the World 
           Trade Center attacks and less than a year later made the U.S. the most hated 
           country in the world, the largest failure of diplomacy in world history.
         - I have set the all-time record for most people worldwide to 
           simultaneously protest me in public venues (15 million people), shattering 
           the record for protests against any person in the history of mankind.  
         - I am the first President in U.S. history to order an unprovoked, 
           pre-emptive attack and the military occupation of a sovereign nation. I did 
           so against the will of the United Nations, the majority of U.S. citizens, 
           and the world community.  
         - I have cut health care benefits for war veterans and support a cut in duty
           benefits for active duty troops and their families in wartime.  
         - In my State of the Union Address, I lied about our reasons for 
           attacking Iraq and then blamed the lies on our British friends.  
         - I am the first President in history to have a majority of
           Europeans (71%) view my presidency as the biggest threat to world peace and security.  
         - I am supporting development of a nuclear "Tactical Bunker Buster," a WMD.  
         - I have so far failed to fulfill my pledge to bring Osama Bin Laden to justice.

RECORDS AND REFERENCES:  
         - All records of my tenure as governor of Texas are now in my 
           father's library, sealed and unavailable for public view.  
         - All records of SEC investigations into my insider trading and my 
           bankrupt companies are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public view.  
         - All records or minutes from meetings that I, or my Vice-President,
           attended regarding public energy policy are sealed in secrecy and
           unavailable for public review.
