<H2>A FREE MIND</H2>

From the book <i>Secular Nation</i> by Thomas Vernon<p>

There are many people who have, from time to time, been tempted to
think for themselves -- who have found themselves questioning beliefs
they inherited but really never examined.&nbsp; This is nowhere more apt
to be the case than in the area of religious beliefs.&nbsp; Our religious
beliefs came to us in a protective coating of age and respectability,
like the invisible "force field" of science fiction.<p>

It takes a degree of intellectual courage to penetrate this penumbra
of sanctity and inspect a belief on its own merits.&nbsp; Still, many
people have done so.&nbsp; They have found themselves asking such
questions as, how do I know that this book called the Bible is the
supernaturally revealed and infallible word of God?&nbsp; How do I know
there is even such a being as God?&nbsp; How does anybody know there is
such a thing as immorality?&nbsp; When people begin seriously to raise
questions of this sort, they find that their "faith", that is, their
accustomed belief-patterns, seem increasingly insubstantial.<p>

To lose one's faith may seem, in prospect, like being turned
out of a comfortable home and left to fend for oneself in a vast and
trackless waste.&nbsp; Those with a persistent curiosity and adventurous
spirit will never-the-less leave their cozy shelter and set out to
learn for themselves what it is like "out there."&nbsp; Although their
first steps may be taken "in fear and trembling," they begin to find
that they are not alone.&nbsp; They discover stalwart companions.&nbsp; They
learn, indeed that they are "compassed about" with a "cloud of
witnesses."&nbsp; As their minds become strengthened by use, they begin to
see what others have seen, that their "spiritual home" was in
reality a prison; its walls were built of ignorance and fear, and
reinforced by habit and custom.<p>

No one is kept in this prison but by oneself; it is a prison
where every inmate is his or her jailer.&nbsp; Everyone, aware of it or
not, already has the key that will unlock the door: the freedom to
seek the truth.<p>
