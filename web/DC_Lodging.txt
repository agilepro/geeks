With a little judicious searching of hotels located close to a station for the outstanding D.C. subway system,
the Metro, much less expensive rates can be found.

One suggestion is Ramada Limited (via Ramada.com (best rate)) in Silver Spring, Maryland on the Red Line, which
has a stop at Union Station two blocks from the convention hotel.  It's $189.00 for three nights including tax.
Not bad when ONE night at the convention hotel is $155.00.  You can walk around three blocks from the station in
Silver Spring to the motel.

Suburban communities on the Metro have lodging that is considerably less than in close to the center city.

You can also take the Metro to and from the airport.

Metro maps can be found at:

There is also lots of useful information about things around each station and other useful data.
Both sites are very helpful.
