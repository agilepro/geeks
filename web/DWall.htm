<h2>The Disappearing Wall</h2>
Published: April 26, 2005
<p>To the dismay of many mainstream religious leaders, the Senate majority
leader, Bill Frist, participated in a weekend telecast organized by conservative
Christian groups to smear Democrats as enemies of "people of faith."
Besides listening to Senator Frist's videotaped speech, viewers heard a speaker
call the Supreme Court a despotic oligarchy. Meanwhile, the House majority
leader, Tom DeLay, has threatened the judiciary for not following the regressive
social agenda he shares with the far-right fundamentalists controlling his
party.
<p>Apart from confirming an unwholesome disrespect for traditional American
values like checks and balances, the assault on judges is part of a wide-ranging
and successful Republican campaign to breach the wall between church and state
to advance a particular brand of religion. No theoretical exercise, the program
is having a corrosive effect on policymaking and the lives of Americans.
<p>The centerpiece is President Bush's so-called faith-based initiative, which
disregards decades of First Amendment law and civil rights protections. Mr. Bush
promised that federal money would not be used to support religious activities
directly, but it is. The program has channeled billions of taxpayers' dollars to
churches and other religion-based providers of social services under legally
questionable rules that allow plenty of room for proselytizing and imposing
religious tests on hiring. The initiative even provides taxpayers' money to
build and renovate houses of worship that are also used to offer social
services.
<p>Offices in the White House and federal departments pump public money to
religious groups, but provide scant oversight or accountability to make sure
that the money is spent on real services, not preaching. Indeed, Mr. Bush's goal
is to finance programs that are explicitly religious.
<p>A recent want ad posted by a taxpayer-financed vocational program of the Firm
Foundation for inmates in a Pennsylvania jail stipulated that a job seeker must
be "a believer in Christ and Christian Life today" and that the
workday "will start with a short prayer." A major portion of inmates'
time is spent on religious lectures and prayer, according to a lawsuit filed by
two civil liberties groups.
<p>The Bush administration and Congress have turned over issues bearing on
women's reproductive rights to far-right religious groups opposed not just to
abortion, but to expanded stem-cell research, effective birth control and AIDS
prevention programs. The Food and Drug Administration continues to dawdle over
approving over-the-counter access to emergency contraception for fear of
inflaming members of the religious right who deem any interference with the
implantation of a fertilized egg to be an abortion. This foot-dragging may be
good politics from one narrow view, but it harms women and drives up the
nation's abortion rate.
<p>The result of this open espousal of one religious view is a censorious
climate in which a growing number of pharmacists feel free to claim moral
grounds for refusing to dispense emergency contraception and even birth control
pills prescribed by a doctor. Public schools shy away from teaching about
evolution, and science museums reject scientifically sound documentaries that
may offend Christian fundamentalists. Public television stations were afraid to
run a children's program in which a cartoon bunny met a lesbian couple.
<p>In a recent Op-Ed article in The Times, John Danforth, the former Republican
senator and U.N. ambassador who is also a minister, said his party was becoming
a political arm of the religious right. He called it a formula for divisiveness
that ultimately threatened the party's future. With the nation lurching toward
the government sponsorship of religion, and the Senate nearing a showdown over
Mr. Bush's egregious judicial nominees, it is a warning well worth heeding.
