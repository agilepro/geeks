You may think that I made this up.  You may think, "This can't happen
here."  

Below is an example what our legislators are doing to "preserve our
freedoms" (of speech, of religion, of thought, etc.) and protect us
from the evil people who hate us for our freedom.  

Beneath the verbatim selected text is a link to the actual House
Resolution document so you can see for yourself.

Anyone remember the concept of "The Separation Of Church And State?" 
It's a really, really good idea.  A very AMERICAN one, too.

HRES 153 IH

108th CONGRESS

1st Session

H. RES. 153


Recognizing the public need for fasting and prayer in order to secure 
the blessings and protection of Providence for the people of the 
United  States and our Armed Forces during the conflict in Iraq and
under the  threat of terrorism at home.

Whereas the United States is currently engaged in a war on terrorism 
in  response to the attacks of September 11, 2001;

Whereas the Armed Forces of the United States are currently engaged  in
a campaign to disarm the regime of Saddam Hussein and liberate the 
people of Iraq;

Whereas humility, fasting , and prayer in times of danger have long 
been rooted in our essential national convictions and have been a 
means  of producing unity and solidarity among all the diverse people
of  this  Nation as well as procuring the enduring grace and
benevolence of  God;

Whereas, through prayer, fasting , and self-reflection, we may better 
recognize our own faults and shortcomings and submit to the wisdom  and
love of God in order that we may have guidance and strength in those 
daily actions and decisions we must take; and 

Whereas dangers and threats to our Nation persist and, in this time  of
peril, it is appropriate that the people of the United States, 
leaders  and citizens alike, seek guidance, strength, and resolve
through  prayer  and fasting : Now, therefore, be it 

Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the  President should issue a proclamation--

(1) designating a day for humility, prayer, and fasting for all  people
of the United States; and 

(2) calling on all people of the United States-- 

(A) to observe the day as a time of prayer and fasting ; 

(B) to seek guidance from God to achieve a greater understanding of 
our  own failings and to learn how we can do better in our everyday 
activities; and

(C) to gain resolve in meeting the challenges that confront our 
Nation.
