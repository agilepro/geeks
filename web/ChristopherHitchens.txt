<p>Over the course of his 60 years, Christopher Hitchens has been a citizen of
both the United States and the United Kingdom. He has been both a socialist
opposed to the war in Vietnam and a supporter of the U.S. war against Islamic
extremism in Iraq. He has been both a foreign correspondent in some of the
world's most dangerous places and a legendary bon vivant with an unquenchable
thirst for alcohol and literature. He is a fervent atheist, raised as a
Christian, by a mother whose Jewish heritage was not revealed to him until her
suicide.<p>In other words, Christopher Hitchens contains multitudes. He sees all sides of
an argument. And he believes the personal is political.<p>This is the story of his life, lived large.
<p>Christopher Hitchens is a contributing editor to <em>Vanity Fair</em> and a
visiting professor of liberal studies at the New School. He is the author of
numerous books, including works on Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, George
Orwell, Mother Teresa, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Henry Kissinger, and his #1 <em>New York Times</em>
bestseller and National Book Award nominee, <em>God Is Not Great</em>
