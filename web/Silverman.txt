Hi Dave,

I got to thinking about the radio host last weekend, and how he ranted about the African men screwing around so much and causing the AIDS epidemic there.  As I recall from my early days as a xtian, Jesus purportedly had something to say about this.  "Let he who is without sin cast the first stone."  (Doncha' just love it when we can use their holy words against them?)

It's frightening how militant Christianity is becoming - antithetical to what was largely written (and is largely believed) about their mythical Christ.  The other religions also seem to be getting more militant.  Militancy breeds militancy.  The Christians, the Jews, the Moslims, the Hindus -- they are all getting fuckin' crazier.  And, the fundies in each religion have more in common with the fundies in the other religions than with the moderates in their own religion.  See http://www.godlessgeeks.com/LINKS/Quiz_JPO.htm

"AIDS is not just God's punishment for homosexuals; it is God's punishment for the society that tolerates homosexuals."

"The Bible is the supreme law that all governments must obey."

"I want you to just let a wave of intolerance wash over you.  I want you to let a wave of hatred wash over you.  Yes, hate is good - Our goal is a Christian nation.  We have a Biblical duty.  We are called by God to conquer this country."
— Randall Terry

"If Christian people work together, they can succeed during this decade in winning back control of the institutions that have been taken from them over the past 70 years.  Expect confrontations that will be not only unpleasant but at times physically bloody.  When it is over, I am convinced God’s people will emerge victorious."
— Reverend Pat Robertson
