Thirty years ago, British scientist Richard Dawkins set out to explain the newest and most thought-provoking
theories of evolutionary biology to a wider audience. Written with clear and vivid prose, Dawkin’s groundbreaking
book <i>The Selfish Gene</i> reignited Darwinian theory and synthesized broad ideas on natural selection,
influencing both his peers and the public. Throughout his prestigious writing career in books including
<i>Unweaving the Rainbow, A Devil’s Chaplain</i>, and <i>The Ancestor’s Tale</i>, Dawkins has exposed many
common misperceptions of evolutionary theory. A rationalist and vocal Atheist, Dawkins asserts the irrational belief
in God in his most recent book <i>The God Delusion.</i> Dawkins firmly roots <i>The God Delusion</i> in historical
arguments for a divine being, from St. Augustine onwards, and negates influential theologians. His impassioned
rebuttal compellingly shows how religious fervor fuels wars, compounds bigotry, and perpetuates oppression in
human society. One of the most influential scientists of our time, Richard Dawkins is the Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University. He is also a Fellow of the Royal Society.<p>
Discover magazine recently called Richard Dawkins "Darwin's
Rottweiler" for his fierce and effective defense of evolution.
Prospect magazine voted him among the top three public intellectuals
in the world (along with Umberto Eco and Noam Chomsky). Now Dawkins
turns his considerable intellect on religion, denouncing its faulty
logic and the suffering it causes.<p>
He critiques God in all his forms, from the sex-obsessed tyrant of the
Old Testament to the more benign (but still illogical) Celestial
Watchmaker favored by some Enlightenment thinkers. He eviscerates the
major arguments for religion and demonstrates the supreme
improbability of a supreme being. He shows how religion fuels war,
foments bigotry, and abuses children, buttressing his points with
historical and contemporary evidence. In so doing, he makes a
compelling case that belief in God is not just irrational, but
potentially deadly.<p>
Dawkins has fashioned an impassioned, rigorous rebuttal to religion,
to be embraced by anyone who sputters at the inconsistencies and
cruelties that riddle the Bible, bristles at the inanity of
"intelligent design," or agonizes over fundamentalism in the Middle
East—or Middle America.
