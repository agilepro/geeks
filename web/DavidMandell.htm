<hr><p><h3>No Santa, No God</h3>
Fremont, CA. Argus Newspaper, 7/9/02<p>
Hurray for Michael Newdow the atheist! He had
the courage to convince the federal court that the
Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional because it
endorses religion with the words "under god". Mr.
Newdow being an atheist was humiliated to have his 2nd
grade daughter say under god, when he knows very well
no god exists, never has existed, or ever will exist.
And how does he know? For the same logical reason
he knows there is no Santa Clause. Believe it or not.
It's ludicrous for 47 million atheists in this country
to recite the P.O.A. with "under god" included.
Atheists are moral, decent, patriotic, responsible,
loving, educated, hard working people. Religion is an
unscrupulous psychological system to mind control
unaware people. Any psychologist will tell you that. It
has caused more suffering, mental anguish, violence,
wars, and medical set backs than any other philosophy.<br>
Please let's keep state and church separate for the
good of our country.

<h3>Science needed for us to progress</h3>
Fremont, CA. Argus newspaper, 12/12/01<p>
The DEC. 6 Argus editorial gave an excellent
explanation on the topic, "California Ignores science
education in Schools".<p>
One paragraph in particular states: "Rather than
taking a holistic approach and giving our children the
best comprehensive education possible, we're leaving
big holes in what they know."<p>
Besides scholastic holes in their curriculums, they
are deprived of the biggest gift of all- their ability
to reason logically in an illogical world. Because
logic is the bases of all science, every child
therefore needs science in order to exercise their
powers of reasoning.<p>
Is it then any wonder that there is such a conflict
between science and religion?<p>
Science develops the mind to think with reason and
logic. Religion does not.<p>
Science has to prove with certitude its statements and
accomplishments. Religion does not.<p>
Regretfully for religion, science disproves many - if
not all - of its suppositions. And that is the hidden
underlying reason for not teaching science in schools.<p>
Are we as human beings going to progress intellectually
or stay stagnate with continuing religious degenerative teachings?<p>
Albert Einstein said: " One thing I have learned in a
long life: that all our science, measured against
reality, is primitive and childlike - and yet it is the
most precious thing we have."

<hr><p><h3>Wall Of Seperation</h3>
Fremont, CA. Argus newspaper, 8/29/02<p>
The First Amendment and Article VI of the Constitution
was written by our founding fathers who were not
christians but diests. Deism is a system of thought
advocating natural religion based on human reason rather
than a god or bible. The founders were well aware they were
creating a secular state. There is no mention of God
or a supreme being in the constitution or in the Bill
of Rights.<p>
Since the wall of seperation between church and state
is established that means our federal, state, county,
and city governments have no power to tell anybody who
to worship or who not to worship. It is none of their
business! It also means no religious dictators, like
Ayotullah Khomeini; no government endorsing
Christianity, Judaism, Islamics, Santanism, God, or
any religion for that matter. No blasphemy laws, no
church taxes, no national religion, no praying in
public schools or government buildings, no nativity
scenes on public land, no ten commandments displayed
in court rooms, and no crosses entrenched on public lands.<p>
We should be grateful to Madison and Jefferson for the
wall of separation that protects us all. The freedom
to believe as one will regarding religion is the ultimate
freedom of the human mind and final approval of self-government.

<hr><p><h3>Westboro Baptists Wrong</h3>
Fremont, CA. Argus Newspaper, 10/18/02<p>
I am a member of Atheists of Silicon Valley, www.godlessgeeks.com, and we deplore the Kansas Westboro Baptist Church condemning the Newark Memorial High School for performing "The Laramie Project". They sound like they are completly brainwashed by their religion. Too bad religion does not teach human compassion based on plain common sense. Since I know there is no God, devil, heaven or hell; I don't need
any bible to tell me what to do and what to believe. I know what is right and what is wrong. Therefore it's only appropriate for me to protest the brainwashed baptists when they arrive in Newark. I urge all people to show the Westboro Baptists that they are definitely positively, unequivocally, unquestionably wrong!

<hr><p><h3>BLAME RELIGION</h3>
Fremont, CA. Argus newspaper, Jan. 31, 2003<p>
In a Jan. 13 letter to the editor, Dan Tracy wrote that despite a few bad priests and bishops in the Catholic Church, the church actively addresses many injustices in the world. Really? It probably is a few THOUSAND bad priests and bishops. The injustices to people, created by not only the Catholic Church, but also by all religions are, insurmountable compared to the good. The first and foremost evil is mental anguish from FEAR created by all religions. If you don't follow their doctrines, the punishment is mental torture in this world, and burning in hell in their imaginary next life. This cruel brainwashing of malleable children's minds amounts to ABUSE, and more often than not remains effective throughout adulthood. The adults are so brainwashed that they are afraid not to believe, and cannot recognize it because they still are subject to the mind control. Simply believing in a god is mental abuse, because this all-powerful, all- knowing god can punish you painfully whenever he chooses. This is the psychology of all religions and why it is so dangerous to everyone. Sept. 11 is one example of religious terror by Muslim fanatics. But what about religious terror of the individual? This encompasses the whole world and is by far the worse.<p>
Lest we forget, religion is the cause of more human suffering, loss of life and scientific stifling than any other institution.

<hr><p><h3>Jesus club</h3>
Fremont, CA. Argus newspaper, July 9, 2003<p>
WARNING to all parents of James Logan High School students: Your child may be enticed by the "Youth Alive For Jesus Club."<p>
Members may offer your child free soda, pizza and ice cream. But what they don't tell you are the pitfalls of their religion.<p>
Suicide, anxieties, depression, family relation problems, social problems, and conning you from your money and time.<p>
Religion has caused more misery to all men in every state of history than any other single idea.<p>

<hr><p><h3>ABSURD AND LUDICROUS</h3>
Fremont, CA. Argus newspaper, April 4, 2004<p>
On March 31, Robert Hunziber wrote taking God out of the Pledge of Allegiance is totally wrong. I say it is totally right for three reasons.<p>
First, "under God" in the pledge is being sanctioned by the government, a violation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; printed at the bottom of this page. This First Amendment means separation of church and state by a million miles. I'm sure people don't want their government to tell them what church to go to, or have them pay religious taxes, or have religious laws govern them. Second, the "under God" is an insult to the intelligence of 40 million godless patriotic Americans. Third, the dictionary defines God as being supernatural. Supernatural does not exit. God does not exit. God is nothing. So to have the powerful country of the United States under nothing is absurd and ludicrous.<p>

<hr><p><h3>In for a surprise</h3>
Fremont, CA. Argus newspaper, August 2, 2004<p>
BOY, IS Bush in for a surprise this coming election.
Little does he know that the atheists, freethinkers, secular humanists and other nonbelievers now have political clout. They have formed GAMPAC -- "Godless Americans Political Action Committee." Of course the GAMPAC has endorsed Kerry/Edwards. John Kerry is way more intelligent than Bush and will make an excellent president.<p>

<hr><p><h3>Religious rhetoric</h3>
Fremont, CA. Argus Newspaper, Jan. 6, 2005<p>
As an atheist, it always amazes me how people can pray after a disaster, but never blame God for causing it in the first place. God killed more than 150,000 people with a tsunami. Is this a merciful God? I don't think so. To say God had a purpose in killing innocent people and children is insane. This terrible tragedy only proves one simple thing: There is no God, only religious rhetoric.<p>

<hr><p><h3>Insulted</h3>
Fremont, CA. Argus Newspaper, March 7, 2005<p>
I agree with The Argus Feb. 23 editorial, "Thou shalt not go overboard." that the Pleasanton lawyer is nitpicking about removing the Ten Commandments from a seal.<p>
However a massive stone copy of the Ten Commandments in Texas ( "Justices hear Ten Commandments cases," ) March 3 is another matter.  To subject atheists to this religious monument is disgusting. To have my tax dollars support any religious symbol on public property is a rip-off and insulting. The stone Decalogue on public property amounts to a governmental imposition of monotheism.<p>
I'm sick and tired of religionists sneaking around the First Amendment to get their demented messages to the public.<p>
It's just too bad that religion is on a decline in the United States. I guess people are getting too smart to believe that religious brain-washing rhetoric anymore. Well good for them.  Religion has caused more suffering and pain than any other man-made idea.<p>

<hr><p><h3>No Saint</h3>
Argus Newspaper Fremont, CA, April 25, 2005<p>
Well, Pope John Paul II is dead. So what.<p>
After reading about him it's obvious the pope was no saint.<p>
You would think with all the millions of people mourning over him, he was a saint. But he wasn't. The only
good thing he did was wave his arms and hands blessing everybody.<p>
I would say as an atheist, he was an excellent public relations man. But what did he do that was so bad?<p>
The worst is that he banned condoms in Africa resulting in millions of babies who would die because their
mothers had no milk. Banning condoms also caused thousands of HIV deaths, and left families throughout the
world producing so many kids that they have to live in squalor.<p>
Next he ordered bishops in the U.S. to oppose civil rights laws that protect gays and lesbians
(including hate-crime laws), leaving them outside the boundaries of legal protection.<p>
Then he told heterosexuals what to do:  no contraceptives, no premarital sex, no oral sex, no anal sex,
no masturbation, no remarriage, no divorce, no artificial insemination, no three-ways, no swinging, no
sterilization, no legal abortion, no stem cell research, no women priests, and no death with dignity
because your forced to live against your wishes.<p>
And lets not forget he didn't stop the priests from sexually abusing thousands of children.<p>

<hr><p><h3>Knowledge is our goal</h3>
June 6, 2005 in the Fremont, CA.  Argus newspaper.<p>
I'M ECSTATIC over the atheist rally held in San Francisco on May 20-22. It was a huge success.<p>
Its main purpose was to confront the rise of religion in politics.<p>
The movie I saw May 21 was "The God Who Wasn't There." It was really interesting because it gave the true documentation of Jesus Christ by historians and scholars.<p>
From watching the movie, you came to a conclusion that Jesus Christ was nothing more than a folk fable. So to believe in Jesus Christ, you must rely on faith alone. But of course faith means without evidence.<p>
So where does that leave you? Simply believing in something that does not exist. And of course, that's a common thing to do with a lot of people who don't care about the facts.<p>
I used to believe in Santa Claus until my friend told me my parents lied to me. They finally apologized; however, I couldn't trust them after that.<p>
Well, because the atheists in the Bay Area are growing so fast, it won't be long before the government takes notice.<p>
Just think, in the near future, instead of "In God we trust" on our money, it will have something really important, like "Knowledge is our goal."<p>
Remember, religion has caused more suffering and misery to humanity than any other idea.<p>

<hr><p><h3>Ludicrous</h3>
July 23, 2005 in the Fremont Argus Newspaper<p>
REGARDING THE July 19 news brief, "Judge 'narrows' lawsuit over pledge," I congratulate Michael Newdow, the only atheist who's got the guts to challenge the U.S. government about "Under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance.<p>
Not everybody is brainwashed into believing the word God stands for a supreme being protecting our country.<p>
There are at least 40 million atheists in the United States who look at the word God as it really is. An imaginary supernatural ludicrous thing.<p>
Do we want our country protected by a supernatural thing? I don't think so. So let's get rid of it.<p>
Good luck to Newdow on his lawsuit. I hope that this time he will win.<p>
Remember, religion is the biggest mental fraud ever devised by man.<p>
