<h1>Is America a Christian Nation?</h1>
<img class="picborder" height="302" alt="Is America A Christian Nation?" hspace="20" src="xian.jpg" width="250" align="right" vspace="20" border="1">
<p>The U.S. Constitution is a secular document. It begins, "We
the people," and contains no mention of "God" or "Christianity."
Its only references to religion are exclusionary, such as, "no
religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any
office or public trust" (Art. VI), and "Congress shall make no
law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the
free exercise thereof" (First Amendment). The presidential oath
of office, the only oath detailed in the Constitution, does not
contain the phrase "so help me God" or any requirement to swear
on a bible (Art. II, Sec. 1, Clause 8). If we are a Christian
nation, why doesn't our Constitution say so?
<p>In 1797 America made a treaty with Tripoli, declaring that
"the government of the United States is not, in any sense,
founded on the Christian religion." This reassurance to Islam
was written under Washington's presidency, and approved by the
Senate under John Adams.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>The First Amendment To The U.S. Constitution:</h3>
<h4>"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment
of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . ."</h4>
</blockquote>
<h2>What about the Declaration of Independence?</h2>
<p>We are not governed by the Declaration. Its purpose was to
"dissolve the political bands," not to set up a religious
nation. Its authority was based on the idea that "governments
are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the
consent of the governed," which is contrary to the biblical
concept of rule by divine authority. It deals with laws,
taxation, representation, war, immigration, and so on, never
discussing religion at all.
<p>The references to "Nature's God," "Creator," and "Divine
Providence" in the Declaration do not endorse Christianity.
Thomas Jefferson, its author, was a Deist, opposed to orthodox
Christianity and the supernatural.</p>
<h2>What about the Pilgrims and Puritans?</h2>
<p>The first colony of English-speaking Europeans was Jamestown,
settled in 1609 for trade, not religious freedom. Fewer than
half of the 102 Mayflower passengers in 1620 were "Pilgrims"
seeking religious freedom. The secular United States of America
was formed more than a century and a half later. If tradition
requires us to return to the views of a few early settlers, why
not adopt the polytheistic and natural beliefs of the Native
Americans, the true founders of the continent at least 12,000
years earlier?
<p>Most of the religious colonial governments excluded and
persecuted those of the "wrong" faith. The framers of our
Constitution in 1787 wanted no part of religious intolerance and
bloodshed, wisely establishing the first government in history
to separate church and state.</p>
<h2>Do the words "separation of church and state" appear in the
Constitution?</h2>
<p>The phrase, "a wall of separation between church and state,"
was coined by President Thomas Jefferson in a carefully crafted
letter to the Danbury Baptists in 1802, when they had asked him
to explain the First Amendment. The Supreme Court, and lower
courts, have used Jefferson's phrase repeatedly in major
decisions upholding neutrality in matters of religion. The exact
words "separation of church and state" do not appear in the
Constitution; neither do "separation of powers," "interstate
commerce," "right to privacy," and other phrases describing
well-established constitutional principles.</p>
<h2>What does "separation of church and state" mean?</h2>
<p>Thomas Jefferson, explaining the phrase to the Danbury
Baptists, said, "the legitimate powers of government reach
actions only, and not opinions." Personal religious views are
just that: personal. Our government has no right to promulgate
religion or to interfere with private beliefs.
<p>The Supreme Court has forged a three-part "Lemon test" (<i>Lemon
v. Kurtzman,</i> 1971) to determine if a law is permissible
under the First-Amendment religion clauses.</p>
<ol>
<li>A law must have a secular purpose.
</li>
<li>It must have a primary effect which neither advances nor
inhibits religion.
</li>
<li>It must avoid excessive entanglement of church and
state. </li>
</ol>
<p>The separation of church and state is a wonderful American
principle supported not only by minorities, such as Jews,
Moslems, and unbelievers, but applauded by most Protestant
churches that recognize that it has allowed religion to flourish
in this nation. It keeps the majority from pressuring the
minority.</p>
<h2>What about majority rule?</h2>
<p>America is one nation under a Constitution. Although the
Constitution sets up a representative democracy, it specifically
was amended with the Bill of Rights in 1791 to uphold individual
and minority rights. On constitutional matters we do not have
majority rule. For example, when the majority in certain
localities voted to segregate blacks, this was declared illegal.
The majority has no right to tyrannize the minority on matters
such as race, gender, or religion.
<p>Not only is it unAmerican for the government to promote
religion, it is rude. Whenever a public official uses the office
to advance religion, someone is offended. The wisest policy is
one of neutrality.</p>
<h2>Isn't removing religion from public places hostile to
religion?</h2>
<p>No one is deprived of worship in America. Tax-exempt churches
and temples abound. The state has no say about private religious
beliefs and practices, unless they endanger health or life. Our
government represents all of the people, supported by dollars
from a plurality of religious and non-religious taxpayers.
<p>Some countries, such as the U.S.S.R., expressed hostility to
religion. Others, such as Iran ("one nation under God"), have
welded church and state. America wisely has taken the middle
course--neither for nor against religion. Neutrality offends no
one, and protects everyone.</p>
<h2>The First Amendment deals with "Congress." Can't states make
their own religious policies?</h2>
<p>Under the "due process" clause of the 14th Amendment
(ratified in 1868), the entire Bill of Rights applies to the
states. No governor, mayor, sheriff, public school employee, or
other public official may violate the human rights embodied in
the Constitution. The government at all levels must respect the
separation of church and state. Most state constitutions, in
fact, contain language that is even stricter than the First
Amendment, prohibiting the state from setting up a ministry,
using tax dollars to promote religion, or interfering with
freedom of conscience.</p>
<h2>What about "One nation under God" and "In God We Trust?"</h2>
<p>The words, "under God," did not appear in the Pledge of
Allegiance until 1954, when Congress, under McCarthyism,
inserted them. Likewise, "In God We Trust" was absent from paper
currency before 1956. It appeared on some coins earlier, as did
other sundry phrases, such as "Mind Your Business." The original
U.S. motto, chosen by John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas
Jefferson, is <i>E Pluribus Unum</i> ("Of Many, One"),
celebrating plurality, not theocracy.</p>
<h2>Isn't American law based on the Ten Commandments?</h2>
<p>Not at all! The first four Commandments are religious edicts
having nothing to do with law or ethical behavior. Only three
(homicide, theft, and perjury) are relevant to current American
law, and have existed in cultures long before Moses. If
Americans honored the commandment against "coveting," free
enterprise would collapse! The Supreme Court has ruled that
posting the Ten Commandments in public schools is
unconstitutional.
<p>Our secular laws, based on the human principle of "justice
for all," provide protection against crimes, and our civil
government enforces them through a secular criminal justice
system.</p>
<h2>Why be concerned about the separation of church and state?</h2>
<p>Ignoring history, law, and fairness, many fanatics are
working vigorously to turn America into a Christian nation.
Fundamentalist Protestants and right-wing Catholics would impose
their narrow morality on the rest of us, resisting women's
rights, freedom for religious minorities and unbelievers, gay
and lesbian rights, and civil rights for all. History shows us
that only harm comes of uniting church and state.
<p>America has never been a Christian nation. We are a free
nation. Anne Gaylor, president of the Freedom From Religion
Foundation, points out: "There can be no religious freedom
without the freedom to dissent."
