<p><br><h2 align=center>What to do at 'prayer time'</h2>
godless friends,
<p>Many of us will be spending time with religious friends and relatives over holidays and other social events.&nbsp; This often involves prayers before meals, which keep the believers ritually reminded of their beliefs.&nbsp; I've found a method to graciously interrupt this habit.&nbsp; When it's apparent that 'prayer time' is imminent, seize the moment, look around, and start thanking people for whatever seems appropriate — your mutual love, friendship, travel to get together, preparation of the wonderful meal you are about to eat, etc.
<p>After this detour they can have their prayers, and you've made a very human point about what really counts — to us and likely also to them.
<p>Several times I’ve found that people didn’t even pray, and I can only guess about what they were thinking.&nbsp; When there is a prayer, I keep my head up and eyes open, and watch.&nbsp; It would be great if somebody were to offer a prayer to some pagan god of the harvest, but it’s never happened.&nbsp; Even tho the prayers are wasted breath, there’s still our humanity to be shared.
<p>Cheers,
<br>Mark
<p><br>"We experience happiness and suffering ourselves; we encounter others in the world and recognize that they experience happiness and suffering as well; we soon discover that 'love' is largely a matter of wishing that others experience happiness rather than suffering; and most of us come to feel that love is more conducive to happiness, both our own and that of others, than hate.&nbsp; There is a circle here that links us to one another: we each want to be happy; the social feeling of love is one of our greatest sources of happiness; and love entails that we be concerned for the happiness of others.&nbsp; We discover that we can be selfish together."<br>— Sam Harris, <i>The End of Faith</i>, pp.186-187<p><hr><p>
