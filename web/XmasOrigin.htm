archaeologists claim<br>

Archeologists say they have traced the origins of the first Christmas <br>
to be celebrated on 25 December, 300 years before the birth of <br>
Christ. The original event marked the consecration of the ancient <br>
world's largest sun god statue, the 34m tall, 200 ton Colossus of <br>
Rhodes.<br>
<br>
It has long been known that 25 December was not the real date of <br>
Christ's birth and that the decision to turn it into Jesus's birthday <br>
was made by Constantine, the Roman Emperor, in the early 4th century <br>
AD. But experts believe the origins of that decision go back to 283 <br>
BC, when, in Rhodes, the winter solstice occurred at about sunrise on <br>
25 December.<br>
<br>
The event was preserved by academics on Rhodes or in Alexandria, and <br>
seems to have been passed to Caesar by the Hellenistic Egyptian <br>
scientists, who advised him on his calendrical reforms.<br>
<br>
The date was chosen because the emperor seems to have believed that <br>
the Roman sun god and Christ were virtually one and the same, and the <br>
sun's birthday had been decreed as 25 December some 50 years earlier <br>
by one of Constantine's predecessors, the Emperor Aurelian. He, in <br>
turn, seems to have chosen 25 December because, ever since Julius <br>
Caesar's calendar reforms of 46 BC, that date had been fixed as the <br>
official winter solstice, even though the real date for the solstice <br>
in Caesar's time was 23 December.<br>
<br>
Dr Alaric Watson, one of the British historians involved in the <br>
current research and author of the major book on the period, Aurelian <br>
and the Third Century, said: "Constantine's choice of 25 December as <br>
the day on which to celebrate the birth of his divine patron, Christ, <br>
must be viewed in terms of the tradition on which Aurelian had drawn <br>
and which may well have originated in the celebration of the winter <br>
solstice at Rhodes some six centuries earlier.<br>
<br>
"Constantine clearly saw his divine patron, initially Sol Invictus <br>
but later Christ, in much the same way as Aurelian had done. The <br>
imagery of Christ, like that of the ruler cults of the Hellenistic <br>
and Roman worlds, owed much to solar theology."<br>
<br>
Jesus's real date of birth is not known, although various different <br>
pre-4th century traditions and computations put it either in the <br>
January to March period or in November.<br>
