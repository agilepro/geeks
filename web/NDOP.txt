— <font color=RED>*PROTEST*</font> of the National Day of Prayer event, at the NEW S.J. City Hall</h2>
<b>Atheists of Silicon Valley will again lead a protest against the National Day of Prayer event,
as we have for the last five years. This is a federally-funded annual abuse of the Constitution.<p>
We will have signs to hold up and pamphlets to hand out. There will be plenty of Christian highschoolers who get the
time off to come to this, and are at least nominally interested in an alternative view. Join us for some fun.<p>
See Joe Mercado's <a href=LINKS/NDOP2004.htm>write-up</a> of 2004's event.
See American Atheists' <a href=AA_NDOP2006.htm>press release</a>.<p>
This year's event will be at the NEW San Jose City Hall, 200 E. Santa Clara St. at 5th St. (see map link below).
This means that there will be far more car and foot traffic than in years past.<p>
GET THERE EARLY!<p>
