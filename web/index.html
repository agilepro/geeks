"Religion, a mediaeval form of unreason, when combined with modern weaponry becomes a real threat to our freedoms. This religious totalitarianism has caused a deadly mutation in the heart of Islam and we see the tragic consequences in Paris today. I stand with Charlie Hebdo, as we all must, to defend the art of satire, which has always been a force for liberty and against tyranny, dishonesty and stupidity. 'Respect for religion' has become a code phrase meaning 'fear of religion.' Religions, like all other ideas, deserve criticism, satire, and, yes, our fearless disrespect."<br>
- Salman Rushdie<p></font>

<i>"There are so many people who speak badly about religions or other religions, who make fun of them, who make a game out of the religions of others. They are provocateurs.

<i>“With respect to public acknowledgment of religious belief, it is entirely clear from our nation's historical practices that the Establishment Clause permits this disregard of polytheists and believers in unconcerned deities, just as it permits the disregard of devout atheists.”</i><br>- Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, <a href=http://wid.ap.org/scotus/pdf/03-1693P.ZD.pdf>06/2005</a><p>
<i>“...ideological rejection of God and an atheism of indifference, oblivious to the Creator and at risk of becoming equally oblivious to human values, constitute some of the chief obstacles to development today. A humanism which excludes God is an inhuman humanism.”</i><br>- Pope Benedict XVI, in his encyclical "Caritas in Veritate" (Charity in Truth)<p>
Pope Benedict XVI stated in May, 2007 that the Church had not imposed itself on the indigenous peoples of the Americas. He said that the natives had welcomed the arrival of European priests at the time of the conquest as they were "silently longing" for Christianity. <i>[Right, and rape victims "silently long" for rape.]</i><p>
<hr><p>“We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus, and nonbelievers.”<br>- President Barack Obama,
in his <a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/us/politics/20text-obama.html>Inaugural Address</a><p>
“Democracy demands that the religiously motivated translate their concerns into universal, rather than religion-specific, values. It requires that their proposals be subject to argument, and amenable to reason. I may be opposed to abortion for religious reasons, but if I seek to pass a law banning the practice, I cannot simply point to the teachings of my church or evoke God's will. I have to explain why abortion violates some principle that is accessible to people of all faiths, including those with no faith at all.”<br>

“The separation of church and state is critical and has caused our democracy and religious practices to thrive.”<br>

<hr><b>Christianity:</b> The belief that a cosmic Jewish zombie who was his own father can make you live forever if you symbolically eat his flesh and telepathically tell him you accept him as your master, so he can remove an evil force from your soul that is present in humanity because a rib-woman was convinced by a talking snake to eat from a magical tree. — unknown<p><!/font><!font color="#662233">
"Imagine a world in which generations of human beings come to believe that certain films were made by God or that specific software was coded by him. Imagine a future in which millions of our descendants murder each other over rival interpretations of Star Wars or Windows 98. Could anything — anything — be more ridiculous? And yet, this would be no more ridiculous than the world we are living in."
<br>— Sam Harris, <i>The End of Faith</i><p>
"Religion is the process of unconscious wish fulfillment, where, for certain people, if the process did not take place it would put them in self-danger of coming to mental harm, being unable to cope with the idea of a godless, purposeless life."<br>— Sigmund Freud</font><p>

<h2 align=middle><a href=FreeMind.htm><font color="#000077">Why Join an Atheist Organization?</h2></a>
In a 1999 poll, 48% of Americans said they would not consider voting for an atheist. Some dictionaries offer an alternate definition of atheist as “wicked.” The Boy Scouts membership form says, “no member can grow into the best kind of citizen without recognizing his obligation to God.”<p>
How are people supposed to know that atheists in fact do grow up to be the best kinds of American citizens every day — if we aren't visible? Atheists of Silicon Valley is reclaiming the A-word in our community by encouraging local atheists to come out of the closet and be open with friends, co-workers, neighbors and family. We're standing up and speaking out. <a href=http://www.atheists.org/flash.line/atheist4.htm>14%</a> of Americans and <a href=LINKS/Unchurched.htm>19%</a> of Californians identify themselves as some kind of non-believer.&nbsp; We may be a minority, but we're sizable and growing.&nbsp; According to the American Religious Identification Survey, Americans who answered "none" when asked to identify their religion numbered 29.4 million in 2001, more than double the 14.3 million in 1990.</table>

Don't be afraid of the A-word! If you're godless, concerned with the increasing god-talk in government and their schemes to funnel our tax dollars toward religious projects, or just need a safe place to sound-off and tell your religious jokes — then join us and experience how much you have in common with other atheists.
