<p><hr><H3>Sunday May 8, 5 pm, Be Powerfully Persuasive, by ArLyne Diamond, Ph.D.<br>
- Silicon Valley Objectivists</h3>
For Objectivists, Libertarians And those Dedicated to Truth and Understanding<p>
Although most of us are extremely well-read and can quote our favorite authors chapter and verse, we often succeed in either boring or alienating the people with whom we are speaking, rather than persuading them to our point of view.<p>
Do you want to win the argument?  Or persuade?  If you are interested in learning how to persuade others, come and listen to Dr. ArLyne Diamond share some information with you about how people receive information, learn new ideas, and even how easily they get turned off and tune out.<p>
Dr. Diamond is a noted writer, public speaker and corporate consultant, specializing in helping people get the best out of themselves and others.  In addition to teaching managers how to manage people, she provides conflict resolution services and teaches persuasion and negotiation.  She also works with people individually to enhance their professional growth.<p>
ArLyne’s doctorate is in psychology – and in addition to her personal reading of the great philosophers, and her formal education, she studied philosophy with Ayn Rand, psychology with Nathaniel Branden, and economics with George Reisman.<p>
This workshop was originally developed for The Torchbearers at Reason Weekend in 2003 and was very well received by some of the brightest minds teaching and writing for Reason Magazine.<p>
