<p>With his face on a £10 note, Darwin is common
currency in Britain. He placed fourth (right behind
Diana, Princess of Wales) in the BBC’s 2002 “Great
Britons” contest. Yet for much of the American
heartland, Darwin is heretical, the real “devil’s
chaplain,” as Darwin himself once mockingly put it. In
“The Reluctant Mr. Darwin,” the journalist David Quammen
distills the latest (largely English) Darwiniana and
shrink-wraps it for Norton’s “Great Discoveries” series.
But judging by the preamble on litigious creationism and
those Gallup revelations about the more than 80 percent
of Americans who believe in life’s divine plan, his
intention is partly to proselytize.

<p>This sort of potted biography tends to rip its
subject out of time, while the historiographical trend,
in the case of the founder of the theory of evolution,
has been the reverse — to locate the Dickensian Darwin
so that his words convey their original sense. But
Quammen’s plucky condensation manages to hold London’s
workhouse world together. It’s half a life, pared down
to the minimum and focused mainly on the years between
the Beagle’s return in 1836 to the publication, in 1859,
of “The Origin of Species,” in which Darwin belatedly
(hence the “reluctance” of Quammen’s title) laid out his
theory. Essential bits of the baby — Darwin’s
upbringing, university education, voyage — can be seen
floating off with the bath water.</p>
<p>Darwin’s creativity in explaining how species vary
forms the crux of the story here. Quammen’s book is
almost as creative, giving a very free translation of
his secondary sources: Darwin becomes “largely an indoor
guy,” whose family purse meant that he never needed a
“day job.” Darwin is “nerdy.” He was indeed socially
awkward, and later his huge beard hid his emotions as
well as his boils. He was also obsessive, testing
thousands of seeds with the same intensity that he
tested thousands of arguments. Such Gradgrind doggedness
seems to define his genius. But he was also fanatical
about the gentlemanly proprieties. Invitations were
answered with courteous refusals, and no cultural
refraction can render these, as Quammen does, as “Leave
me the hell alone!”
<p>Decorum was Darwin’s watchword, and it’s essential to
understanding his predicament. He hated giving offense,
yet covertly held what to many were pestilential
notions. So he was always politely self-effacing, not
least when hinting at what Quammen calls his “scary
materialism” and his chance-driven evolution, which was
like “confessing a murder.”
<p>Darwin’s was a double life. He glided among the
Anglican divines while surreptitiously scribbling notes
on monkey-men. With his speculations came a mysterious
chronic sickness, with “gut-heaving, head-blurring
symptoms.” Darwin’s jottings and dreams reveal a worried
man, and invalidism would eventually become an excuse to
shut out society. The isolation was increased by his
departure in 1842 to the Kentish village of Down.
<p>Why was the upstanding patriarch drawn to evolution
in the first place? Was it just the evidence thrust in
his face? Others had seen something similar. Drunken
John MacGillivray, the gifted naturalist on the H.M.S.
Rattlesnake, recorded representative snail species on
each of the Great Barrier Reef islands (just as Darwin
had recorded finches and tortoises in the Galapagos),
but saw no evolutionary implications. Darwin’s
upbringing among the squires acquainted him with fancy
duck and dog breeding. Mate this to his Unitarian
inheritance, his exposure to radical questions about
mind, matter and Lamarckian evolution at Edinburgh. Add
in the time to digest Charles Lyell’s geology of slowly
evolving landscapes and Malthus’s pessimistic
predictions about human overpopulation. And more pieces
of the jigsaw may still turn up.
<p>But now is a good moment to gloss the Darwin
industry. After the pathbreaking studies on Darwin’s
notebooks in the 1980’s, and with the projected
32-volume “Correspondence of Charles Darwin” halfway
complete, we seem to be in a phase of consolidation,
though the coming bicentennial of Darwin’s birth and the
150th anniversary of the publication of “The Origin of
Species” will provide an opportunity for retooling. If
some big themes — progress, race, empire — are absent
from Quammen’s boils-and-all distillation, plenty are
present. No hagiographer, he reveals Darwin’s story as
sad and heroic by turns. The hastily produced “Origin,”
we’re told, is flawed. (Quite right — don’t believe
those who tell you it is brilliantly written.) “The
Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication” is
identified as one of his “somniferous duds” though we
don’t really hear why (it foundered under a welter of
facts, as the respectable Darwin — so fearful of
criticism — nailed every evolutionary point a hundred
times over).
<p>Quammen captures the hottest revisionism, if
occasionally to warm up some old chestnuts. The
anti-design implications of Darwin’s random variation
and selection are used against modern fundamentalists, a
Manichean approach that tends to feed back into Darwin’s
own world. So we hear of “Charles’s recent free fall
into disbelief” at the time of his marriage in 1839,
when in fact his growing skepticism was a more
protracted, complicated affair.
<p>Still, “The Reluctant Mr. Darwin” works well as a
vernacular primer on the Victorian view of evolution.
And it has its hilarious moments, particularly when it
depicts Darwin as some Philip Marlowe, dragging on a
cigarette, playing pool, squinting through a haze of
smoke (in the refined Ilkley Wells sanitarium for
gentlefolk). It is as disconcerting as Shakespeare in
modern dress. Anachronism and journalese may be the way
to get the Word across. But the gentlemanly Darwin might
not have approved.
<p>Adrian Desmond is writing a book, with
James Moore, on the anti-slavery underpinnings of
Darwin’s theories of human evolution.</div>
