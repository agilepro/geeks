Hello Dan,

I stayed up late Monday night reviewing the debate half of Sunday's event.  It was an arduous task taking notes on what the two of you said.  He talked especially fast (and sometimes apparently in Arabic, to give his words extra magic).  I will be interested in reading the transcript that they say will be done.  I don't envy the person doing it.  I didn't envy your attempting to take notes on it during the debate.

Your performance was impressive, direct, gentle, organized, and logical.  His was disjointed and full of bald statements without any backing.  You addressed almost all of his points, easily showing their lack of merit.  He addressed few of your points, often with the same types of blanket statements that he used in his initial 20 minutes.

One area that I think you could give even better evidence on, is a hobby of mine - cosmology, the study of the origin and evolution of the universe.  A recent DISCOVER magazine (Vol. 23 No. 4; April 2002) had a great article on it.  You can read it online at starting at http://www.discover.com/recent_issue/index.html  Below are two paragraphs of mine on cosmology and evolution.

Once again, thank you for such a coherent, logical, and human performance.  I gained new insights from it.

godlessly,
Mark Thomas

Mark,

Thanks! You saw that I only had 10 minutes for rebuttal, and although I have TONS of notes on
cosmology, I didn't get to it. Anyway, he only mentioned "fine-tuning" briefly, almost in
passing, so I didn't consider it a major point of his.

He concentrated on "design," as you know. And I used about half of my "design" arsenal on him. I
would have liked to invoke the multiverse, and all that, but there was not time.

Then, I really debated what I should say in the Closing. I had prepared TWO different Closing
Statements. One was to recap the debate and tie up loose ends, which would have been good. The
other, which I used, was a plea for our common humanity -- shooting
for a higher ground than a technical debate, which I think worked better with such an audience.

Maybe it was a tactical mistake, but I think it was a strategic plus, looking at the big
picture, trying to get people to think outside the circle.

Yes, some poor woman is currently transcribing that whole debate! Wow. I transcribed a debate
once, and it was back-breaking work, more than 20 hours at a keyboard with headphones.

Thanks, again, for your comments. They are helpful.
