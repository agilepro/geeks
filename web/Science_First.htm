<h2><font size=6>Science and the First Amendment</font></h2>
<h2>by PATRICIA J. PRINCEHOUSE</h2>
<p>[posted online on May 16, 2006]
<p>When I was a grad student, I had romantic notions about how knowledge was
gained, how science was done and how democracy worked. Little by little, those
notions have changed.
<p>One blow came when I was doing field work at a 19-million-year-old fossil
site in Africa. This wonderful site had six different species of fossil
hominoids all living in the same place at the same time. It had been declared a
national monument, and yet the shoestring budget couldn't muster the funds to
bring all the fossils back to the museum. Many had to be left to erode into
dust, along with all the knowledge they could have offered.
<p>I had the notion that scientific investigation was always well planned-out,
with reasonably clear and specific expectations for how knowledge would advance.
This view was challenged when my adviser at Yale explained how a crucial
discovery in human evolution actually came about. They were in the field in
Africa, he said, and they were really bored. No one had found much of anything
and it was too hot to breathe anyway. The only thing they kept finding were
piles and piles of fresh elephant dung. It's not clear how it got started, but
at some point somebody chucked a handful of elephant dung at someone, and pretty
soon they were in the middle of an elephant dung slinging contest. At one point,
he hit the deck to avoid getting plastered, and right in front of his eyes was a
fossilized footprint. The dung-slinging escapade led to the discovery of a trail
of 3 million-year-old footprints made by three individuals of the same species
as the fossil hominid
<a href="http://www.wsu.edu/gened/learn-modules/top_longfor/timeline/%20afarensis/afarensis-a.html">
Lucy</a>. Three million years ago, a volcano had erupted, and before the ashfall
had hardened, these three had crossed the tuff. Two of the individuals were
walking together, and the third, a tiny child, was stepping into the footprints
of one of the adults. This wonderful find was the result of serendipitous
elephant dung.
<p>That's not exactly how I thought science worked. But it turns out that
gaining knowledge and doing science is a messy business, impinged on by all
sorts of prosaic issues like funding and elephant dung. And I've come to love
seeing how embedded science is in the rest of human endeavor. I've learned to
value such stories as going to the heart of science as a very creative and very
human enterprise.
<p>But what about democracy? What about the noble Constitution? I used to think
the US Constitution was fixed, an absolute guarantee of freedom of speech,
freedom of religion, freedom of the press in this country. The past five years
have shown me that the Constitution is valuable only insofar as people are
willing to stand up for the rights it protects. Our freedoms are guaranteed only
as long as ordinary, everyday people are willing to claim them--indeed, to
insist on them.
<p>People ask me, Why pour so much energy into protecting science education? Why
not fight for literacy generally or any of a thousand other educational issues?
I have two answers. One is easy: I know about evolution, so it makes sense that
I would work on what I know best. The second is harder to grasp. And that is
that freedom of religion is the bedrock foundation of liberty in this country.
If we allow certain special-interest religious groups to co-opt the public
school science classroom, to use it as a vehicle for converting children to
religious views their parents don't hold, if we allow them to spout outright
lies about the nature and content of science, what do we really have left? If
you can lie about science and get away with it, you can lie about anything.
<p>Evolution is just the tip of the iceberg or, as the creationists put it, the
leading edge of "the wedge." The wedge they are seeking to drive through the
heart of American democracy. The lies about science are not limited to
evolution. Every day more lies about science seep into public consciousness.
Lies about stem cell biology, lies about global warming, about clean air and
water, lies about sexuality, about conception and contraception, lies about the
effects of hurricanes on metropolitan infrastructure.
<p>The war on science is a war on democracy itself. And the special weapons and
tactics are rhetorical. The enemies of democracy use the language of tolerance
to attack it from inside. Why, they ask, are we "censoring" the evidence for
"intelligent design"? Why do we deny our teachers the "right" to use their
"academic freedom" to teach "critical analysis" of evolution. Isn't it only fair
to teach both the evidence for and against evolution? All these clever ploys
play well in the media on this issue and many, many others, and we will see
these word games more and more in coming years. I call it the "orange is the new
pink" strategy; every time the public cottons on to a catch term like "creation
science" or "intelligent design," they change to a more neutral-sounding term
like "critical analysis" or "evidence against." But defenders of American
freedom are learning to stand up and say no, it really is fair to forbid
teachers to lie to students, to prohibit school boards from using the power of
the state to convert children to other peoples' religions. Tolerance requires
judgment.
<p>So the rhetorical battle is pitched and the enemy is well armed. But it turns
out that standing up for freedom and democracy is a lot like doing science. You
start with noble principles and do the best you can, but when you get right down
to it, you spend a lot of time dodging elephant dung.
<p>Defending the Constitution is a messy business, but is it worth it? You
betcha. Our future depends on it. </p>
