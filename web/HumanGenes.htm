Providing the strongest evidence yet that humans are still
evolving, researchers have detected some 700 regions of the human
<a title="Recent and archival health news about Genetics and Heredity." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/geneticsandheredity/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">
genome</a> where genes appear to have been reshaped by natural
selection, a principal force of evolution, within the last 5,000
to 15,000 years.
<p>The genes that show this evolutionary change
include some responsible for the senses of taste
and smell, digestion, bone structure, skin color
and brain function.<p>Many of these instances of
selection may reflect the pressures that came to
bear as people abandoned their hunting and
gathering way of life for settlement and
agriculture, a transition well under way in
Europe and East Asia some 5,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Under natural selection, beneficial genes
become more common in a population as their
owners have more progeny.
<p>Three populations were studied, Africans,
East Asians and Europeans. In each, a mostly
different set of genes had been favored by
natural selection. The selected genes, which
affect skin color, hair texture and bone
structure, may underlie the present-day
differences in racial appearance.
<p>The study of selected genes may help
reconstruct many crucial events in the human
past. It may also help physical anthropologists
explain why people over the world have such a
variety of distinctive appearances, even though
their genes are on the whole similar, said Dr.
Spencer Wells, director of the Genographic
Project of the National Geographic Society.
<p>The finding adds substantially to the
evidence that human evolution did not grind to a
halt in the distant past, as is tacitly assumed
by many social scientists. Even evolutionary
psychologists, who interpret human behavior in
terms of what the brain evolved to do, hold that
the work of natural selection in shaping the
human mind was completed in the pre-agricultural
past, more than 10,000 years ago.
<p>"There is ample evidence that selection has
been a major driving point in our evolution
during the last 10,000 years, and there is no
reason to suppose that it has stopped," said
Jonathan Pritchard, a population geneticist at
the University of Chicago who headed the study.
<p>Dr. Pritchard and his colleagues, Benjamin
Voight, Sridhar Kudaravalli and Xiaoquan Wen,
report their findings in today's issue of
PLOS-Biology.
<p>Their data is based on DNA changes in three
populations gathered by the HapMap project,
which built on the decoding of the human genome
in 2003. The data, though collected to help
identify variant genes that contribute to
disease, also give evidence of evolutionary
change.
<p>The fingerprints of natural selection in DNA
are hard to recognize. Just a handful of
recently selected genes have previously been
identified, like those that confer resistance to
<a title="Recent and archival health news about Malaria." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/malaria/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">
malaria</a> or the ability to digest lactose in
adulthood, an adaptation common in Northern
Europeans whose ancestors thrived on cattle
milk.
<p>But the authors of the HapMap study released
last October found many other regions where
selection seemed to have occurred, as did an
analysis published in December by Robert K.
Moysis of the
<a title="More articles about the University of California." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/university_of_california/index.html?inline=nyt-org">
University of California</a>, Irvine.
<p>Dr. Pritchard's scan of the human genome
differs from the previous two because he has
developed a statistical test to identify just
genes that have started to spread through
populations in recent millennia and have not yet
become universal, as many advantageous genes
eventually do.
<p>The selected genes he has detected fall into
a handful of functional categories, as might be
expected if people were adapting to specific
changes in their environment. Some are genes
involved in digesting particular foods like the
lactose-digesting gene common in Europeans. Some
are genes that mediate taste and smell as well
as detoxify plant poisons, perhaps signaling a
shift in
<a title="Recent and archival health news about Diet and Nutrition." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/diet/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">
diet</a> from wild foods to domesticated plants
and animals.
<p>Dr. Pritchard estimates that the average
point at which the selected genes started to
become more common under the pressure of natural
selection is 10,800 years ago in the African
population and 6,600 years ago in the Asian and
European populations.
<p>Dr. Richard G. Klein, a paleoanthropologist
at Stanford, said that it was hard to correlate
the specific gene changes in the three
populations with events in the archaeological
record, but that the timing and nature of the
changes in the East Asians and Europeans seemed
compatible with the shift to agriculture. Rice
farming became widespread in China 6,000 to
7,000 years ago, and agriculture reached Europe
from the Near East around the same time.
<p>Skeletons similar in form to modern Chinese
are hard to find before that period, Dr. Klein
said, and there are few European skeletons older
than 10,000 years that look like modern
Europeans.
<p>That suggests that a change in bone structure
occurred in the two populations, perhaps in
connection with the shift to agriculture. Dr.
Pritchard's team found that several genes
associated with embryonic development of the
bones had been under selection in East Asians
and Europeans, and these could be another sign
of the forager-to-farmer transition, Dr. Klein
said.
<p>Dr. Wells, of the National Geographic Society,
said Dr. Pritchard's results were fascinating
and would help anthropologists explain the
immense diversity of human populations even
though their genes are generally similar. The
relative handful of selected genes that Dr.
Pritchard's study has pinpointed may hold the
answer, he said, adding, "Each gene has a story
of some pressure we adapted to."
<p>Dr. Wells is gathering DNA from across the globe
to map in finer detail the genetic variation
brought to light by the HapMap project.<p>Dr.
Pritchard's list of selected genes also includes
five that affect skin color. The selected
versions of the genes occur solely in Europeans
and are presumably responsible for pale skin.
Anthropologists have generally assumed that the
first modern humans to arrive in Europe some
45,000 years ago had the dark skin of their
African origins, but soon acquired the paler
skin needed to admit sunlight for vitamin D
synthesis.
<p>The finding of five skin genes selected 6,600
years ago could imply that Europeans acquired
their pale skin much more recently. Or, the
selected genes may have been a reinforcement of
a process established earlier, Dr. Pritchard
said.
<p>The five genes show no sign of selective
pressure in East Asians.
<p>Because Chinese and Japanese are also pale,
Dr. Pritchard said, evolution must have
accomplished the same goal in those populations
by working through different genes or by
changing the same genes — but many thousands of
years before, so that the signal of selection is
no longer visible to the new test.
<p>Dr. Pritchard also detected selection at work
in brain genes, including a group known as
microcephaly genes because, when disrupted, they
cause people to be born with unusually small
brains.
<p>Dr. Bruce Lahn, also of the University of
Chicago, theorizes that successive changes in
the microcephaly genes may have enabled the
brain to enlarge in primate evolution, a process
that may have continued in the recent human
past.
<p>Last September, Dr. Lahn reported that one
microcephaly gene had recently changed in
Europeans and another in Europeans and Asians.
He predicted that other brain genes would be
found to have changed in other populations.
<p>Dr. Pritchard's test did not detect a signal
of selection in Dr. Lahn's two genes, but that
may just reflect limitations of the test, he and
Dr. Lahn said. Dr. Pritchard found one
microcephaly gene that had been selected for in
Africans and another in Europeans and East
Asians. Another brain gene, SNTG1, was under
heavy selection in all three populations.
<p>"It seems like a really interesting gene,
given our results, but there doesn't seem to be
that much known about exactly what it's doing to
the brain," Dr. Pritchard said.
<p>Dr. Wells said that it was not surprising the
brain had continued to evolve along with other
types of genes, but that nothing could be
inferred about the nature of the selective
pressure until the function of the selected
genes was understood.
<p>The four populations analyzed in the HapMap
project are the Yoruba of Nigeria, Han Chinese
from Beijing, Japanese from Tokyo and a French
collection of Utah families of European descent.
The populations are assumed to be typical of
sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia and Europe, but
the representation, though presumably good
enough for medical studies, may not be exact.
<p>Dr. Pritchard's test for selection rests on
the fact that an advantageous mutation is
inherited along with its gene and a large block
of DNA in which the gene sits. If the improved
gene spreads quickly, the DNA region that
includes it will become less diverse across a
population because so many people now carry the
same sequence of DNA units at that location.
<p>Dr. Pritchard's test measures the difference
in DNA diversity between those who carry a new
gene and those who do not, and a significantly
lesser diversity is taken as a sign of
selection. The difference disappears when the
improved gene has swept through the entire
population, as eventually happens, so the test
picks up only new gene variants on their way to
becoming universal.
<p>The selected genes turned out to be quite
different from one racial group to another. Dr.
Pritchard's test identified 206 regions of the
genome that are under selection in the Yorubans,
185 regions in East Asians and 188 in Europeans.
The few overlaps between races concern genes
that could have been spread by migration or else
be instances of independent evolution, Dr.
Pritchard said.<p>
