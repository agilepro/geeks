//--></SCRIPT>
 </font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q.  And
these incendiary views are…?</b></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A.  Well, where to
begin?  Essentially I claim that when man received his new brain
addition—-the cerebrum--which separated him from the animal kingdom, it
enabled him to create abstract ideas as well as attribute cause and
effect. The first thing he did with this new talent was to try to get
some control over his terrible, cruel and meaningless life.  He did so
by trying to figure out how nature worked so as to possibly influence
its random cruelty.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>Where did he get the
idea from that he might be able to influence nature by his own behavior?
He did so logically, by following a model he--and every animal--knew
very well.  During childhood, he had imprinted in his emotional makeup
the realization that if he obeyed his father, if he behaved, then his
father was often kinder to him, might give him an occasional treat, and
perhaps make him work a little less hard at his chores. He certainly
knew if he disobeyed, he would be quickly and harshly disciplined.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>As a child, the
benefits of this submissive behavior to the alpha figure was proven
rationally and emotionally to be true and effective.  It did not take a
new brain to learn this. Any animal would behave the same.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>But now he is an
adult, and an adult with a brain than can construct cause and effect. So
it was a natural extension of that childhood memory to assume that
perhaps, if once again he behaved properly, if he obeyed, and especially
if he paid obeisance just as he had as a child, then maybe somehow he
would be smiled upon and his load lightened.  This must have worked
often enough to convince himself, and nearly every other human in the
world, that humbling yourself before the now invisible father had a net
benefit. It was better than nothing, and most importantly, it seemed to
give him a smidgeon of control over the otherwise implacably cruel
forces of nature. </font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>Every human society
has this feature of kow-towing to an invisible alpha figure.  It didn’t
matter that the idea is completely false; it just matters that it seemed
to give man some tiny control over his fate and—importantly—a reward for
sticking it out. In a sense it was a major survival tool.  Instead of
throwing in the towel when the situation became impossible—only humans
can commit suicide--it gave him the encouragement to continue on, to
care for his offspring, so he could collect his heavenly social security
benefits—a reward that he himself dreamed up!</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>Much folk lore
arises from the mistaken attribution that some act that man has
committed—say working on the Sabbath—will cause another event to occur.
Earthquakes will shake, crops will fail and wives will become barren.
There is no connection whatever with working on the Sabbath and these
disasters, but because of his new brain’s capability, man is able to
create out of whole cloth the <u>idea</u> that there is a connection—and
then believe his idea is real, because he wants it to be. He doesn’t
want to work continuously, but doesn’t want to admit to such laziness.
So he conjures up that working on the Sabbath is against the all-seeing
father’s wishes, to be punishable not by a cuff, but by natural
disasters. And not just for himself--but for anyone working on the
Sabbath. You break the rule--we all suffer.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>There is a second
important aspect to this newly acquired talent.  As you know, man’s
brain becomes wired-up as he grows up. The huge intellectual feat of
learning a new language—which comes so easily to children—is much more
difficult for adults, whose brains have already made their connections.
In fact, if humans are not taught any language as children—the so-called
“wolf children” found in the wild—they will never be able to speak any
language fluently after they have reached about 15 years of age. Thus,
children are most impressionable when they are  young.  And what is it
that impresses them the most?  Their parents, of course.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>Father can walk into
a dark room and make it light; mother can make hot food come out of a
big box. Or, in cave man days, father can make a fire and warm the cave,
mother can feed me from her warm breast. These are all inexplicable
miracles to children.  True, they quickly take them for granted, but
nevertheless, fixated in their brains at childhood is the proven truth
that a higher authority figure--Daddy--can work miracles. He and mom
feed me, provide shelter and nurse my wounds.  This powerful emotional
imprint never leaves the average child. Thus, this god-sense becomes
wired into the brain at an early age. (By the way, Sigmund Freud had
this idea long before me.)</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q.  So you’re
saying that religion is a bunch of childhood hogwash…?</b>

  </font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A. Oh, by no means.
It is not <i>historically</i> true--a fact the orthodox find impossible
to understand. But religion certainly embodies the hopes and dreams of
billions of people who desperately need a fixed star by which to set
their course. And who have absolutely nothing else: no money, no
chances, no hope. They are the downtrodden, the chronically exploited,
the uneducated, the filthy, the ill and the always-hungry.  Their
religion-—any religion--gives them the hope they need to carry on
regardless.  So it is very much <i>mythically</i> true, which becomes
"truer" to them than their actual miserable lives. Although shielded
from want, the well-to-do also need religion, the same way a compass
needle needs a magnetic field. </font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>And recognize as
well, that because man wanted his own construct to be true, he did
everything in his power to make it so.  He acted as if it were
true--this is called faith.  He found ever more effective ways
to explain away discrepancies. He thrilled to moments when-—by
coincidence-—his prayers were answered, and he broadcast loudly this
additional "proof."</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q. In other
words, he invested hugely in his own creation…</b></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A. Precisely. And he
built up his system of rewards and punishments to see that this
precarious construct-—which he believed shielded him from the worst
effects of cruel nature-—was not tampered with by ignoramuses whose
blundering might cause the protection to fail, and cast them all back
into the pit. Thus, intolerance toward heretics began as a genuine
safety mechanism.  Only later did it become a primary method of control.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>Of course, an
inevitable side-effect was the creation of a priestly class to mediate
your emotional well-being. They built up everywhere a myriad of ways to
reinforce the salvatory message—-always to their own personal gain, and
hopefully to yours, too. <b>It’s no different than the stockbroker cult</b>
which wants to “mediate” your money to their benefit, and maybe to
yours.  In both cases, it is essential to believe that the system works,
that it is “real.”  Start to cast doubt and you risk depriving a very
powerful establishment of its livelihood. This has never been a winning
proposition.  <i>Neither</i> side wants to hear it: not the peasants,
not the priests.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>Of course it is very
painful to come to the realization that miracles <i>contra naturum</i>
can’t and don’t, and have never happened—ever.  You are left with a huge
gaping hole in your life: How should you live?  How do you wish to
live?  That is where religion so conveniently steps in, and it is a
tremendous survival feature of the human mind that we were able to
repeatedly create a vision of what life and the hereafter <i>should</i>
be.  <i>Must</i> be. <i>Is</i>.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q.  But what
about miracles?</b></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A. Well, miracles
certainly do occur.  The miracle of childbirth, the miracle of falling
in love, the miracle of Ebenezer Scrooge becoming a philanthropist.  All
of these miracles are enjoyable.  Some of these  miracles may be
unlikely or rare, but none of them are supernatural. And if they were
supernatural, they were not real--full stop.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q.  But this
realization of the essential meaninglessness of life would be less
interesting to wealthy people…?</b></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A. Yes. They are
able to ameliorate much of the deprivation of living by shielding
themselves from life’s fundamental physical horrors. Jesus recognized
this by saying it is harder for a rich man to get to heaven than to
thread a rope through the eye of a needle.  If you don’t need myth to
support your psyche, than you don’t need religion as we define it here.
This is a greatly over-looked aspect of Jesus' teachings.  We all know
that the wealthy can protect themselves from the ordinary vicissitudes
of life; Yet are they any happier than anyone else? Jesus has indirectly
answered that question, but the orthodoxy has failed completely to even
address the issue.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>The biggest threat
to religion is wealth, security and happiness. Thus, the enormous
success of Islam, which provides a staple diet of poverty, fear and
sorrow.   But the chances of wealth and happiness taking over the world
is still pretty slender. But where it does—in major cities and in richer
sections of the US for example--it causes orthodox religions to
suffocate. To survive, they must rediscover the essential Jesus. </font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>The second biggest
threat was recognized centuries ago by </font><font size=2>
<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08130b.htm">
<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Irenaeus</font></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">,
the Church’s  most virulent heretic hunter.  He decried the ability of </font><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14145c.htm"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Sophists</font></a></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>
to mimic the Church’s supernatural teachings but always turn the point
around to natural causes. They had the right idea long before Jesus was
born: "Heaven"--that is, peace of mind--comes from how we receive the
natural world we live in.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q.  Are you
saying that heresy is not the biggest threat to religion?</b> </font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>Oh, not at all.
Some heresy is actually quite beneficial.  It gives people a symbol
around which to rally. Hitler really had that figured out. The German
people, a warrior culture, had just suffered a horrific war (WW-1) and
been humiliated on the battlefield. What better way to vent their
collective spleens than by fanning an hysterical hatred of the Jewish
heretic? And on the other side, look at how important the swastika has
become to the Jewish religion.  It too provides a focus for them to
ventilate--in this case about the unfairness of life, the evilness of
man and their special place in God's eyes. Quite an astonishing
symbiosis.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q. So the
Sophists would agree with your definition of "miracles?”</b></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A.
Precisely.  Because the Sophists had the right idea; they believed in
the simple reality of miracles, not the artificially contrived
explanation so necessary to the growth of the church.  Religion is a
construct that, when it is not making them up, tries to <i>explain</i>
facts in a particular light rather than relate or tell them.  It uses
and embodies mankind’s most intimate experiences and beliefs.  Those
experiences are true--they happened. But creating a particular <i>
explanation</i>—-as religions do-—over another is a simple exercise of
authoritarianism. The <i>explanations</i> didn’t happen. They were just
made up. That there was a flood is fact.  Explaining who or what caused
it is always suspect.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q.  Thank you,
sir, for a very forthright, if highly controversial disquisition.</b>

</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q. Professor, the
main thread brought up by e-mailers concerning your thesis, other than
the usual illiterate hate mail, is “So what?”</b></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A.  By which, I
presume, they mean, what bearing does man’s natural predilection to
conceive of a superior father figure have to do with proving or
disproving whether there is a God?</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>Well, it moves the
argument to a different stage.  If we show that man’s rational gift
automatically causes him to transmute his childhood experience with a
father-figure to an adult conception of another superior power-–a power
that he hopes can alter natural disasters such as storms, drought and
the like–-then we have a simple, logical reason why man is “religious.”
This theory then puts the ball into the supernatural religion advocates’
court.  They are now obliged to show that their rationale for an actual
supernatural God is at least as convincing as the simple nature
argument. And this rationale has to be more than the usual insistence
that their belief is so intense it must be true.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q. But you say
“rational gift.”  Who is the gift-giver?</b>   </font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A. Hah!  There is
the nub of the problem.  And this is once again a fault of our superb
ability to create artificial realities.  Language, like mathematics, is
a completely man-made creation.  It is an artifice.  Orthodox religious
believers fall in love with language, because it provides them the
building blocks to create their own religious edifice unfettered by
gravity.  And language also has a problem of provenance.  The only words
we have to use are those that arose from our experiences.  Since the
word “gift” arose as a present given to us from someone, it suggests
quite naturally that for there to be a gift, there must be a gift-giver.
But part of language is to take a specific meaning and generalize from
it.  In other words, to alter or enlarge a word’s narrow original
meaning.  So we have the “gift” of musical ability, the “gift” of a
perfect sweater-weather day for skiing, the “gift” of surviving a
accident in which others are killed.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q. But what is
wrong with saying that the reason you survived an accident is because
God wanted to preserve you for his own reasons?</b></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A. You <i>can</i>
say and believe that.  It makes perfect sense.  If there is a God, then
he could have saved you instead of others.  In fact it seems to makes
more sense because it seems to give reason–right or wrong–to a factual
incident. Even when there is no reason.  It makes thinking about the
accident easier because instead of being an entirely random event, it is
now nicely fit into a story that suits human psychology.  You are not
just alive–<i> you have been spared</i> .  Note that your being alive is
a fact, while your having been spared is an explanation. Note with what
alacrity the human mind leaps from facts to explanations.  The new
brain, with its survival lust to find reasons for events, always wants
to leap from facts to explanations. That is the so-called “religious
gene.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>But I have presented
here a natural explanation of why people naturally believe in a
supernatural being.  Occam favors the simplest explanation.  Those who
wish to push a more complex explanation are obliged to show why their
complication is better, or more true. And what the additional
complications bring to the table–other than accreting more power to the
claimants.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b> Q.  All right,
Professor, you have made the argument that religion is a carry-over of
childhood awe of the father into adulthood awe of a supreme

leave the creationists and their “intelligent design” argument?</b>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A.  To answer that,
let us first define what an ideologue is because, as I will claim, <u>
all</u> orthodox religious people are ideologues, that is, untrustworthy
to argue their case.  An ideologue is someone who argues from a fixed
conclusion—a conclusion that cannot be questioned or changed.  Unlike a
rational inquirer, who examines all evidence in order to find a
conclusion, an ideologue "knows" the answer and is looking only for that
evidence which will support it.  History has continually shown that
those who argue as ideologues--from fixed conclusions--have been
consistently wrong about everything—from the flat earth, to the earth as
center of the universe, and now to “intelligent design.”  </font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A.  Yes; a good
point.  But they do that on a temporary basis.  It’s like a trial where
they defend their point of view and see if it passes the test.  If it
does not, the loser may be disappointed, but he takes the new evidence
that the trial has brought forth, and hopes to fit it in with his
continuing effort to explain his thesis—whatever it is. By successive
trials, the truth gradually emerges. <i> Unlike religion, scientific
conclusions are never fixed in advance.</i>  Most importantly,
scientists are obliged to explain exculpatory evidence.  They
cannot–-as ideologues always do-—ignore it.  In fact, in science, <i>a
single piece</i> of negative evidence, if it is true evidence, can sink
an entire majestic theory.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q.  Well, how is
the intelligent design theory wrong?</b>  </font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A. It is wrong on
two major counts:  It is completely wrong on the archeological evidence,
which not only proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that man evolved over
hundreds of thousand of years into what he is today, and that he evolved
from some sort of lesser ape-like primate.  And it is wrong on a
theoretical basis, which claims that evolution cannot be--is not
"powerful" enough--to have produced such a miraculous creation as man in
so short a time.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>The sorriest aspect
of intelligent design is that creationists who espouse it either
completely ignore the archeological record—which is lying by
omission--or they pathetically try to pick at it in hopes that showing
one tiny questionable aspect will bring the entire theory down—which is
lying by innuendo.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q. But you just
said that a single negative fact could destroy an entire argument.</b>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A.  Yes, of course.
But creationists haven’t found such powerful negative evidence.  They
usually pull out of context some arcane interpretation, and harp on it
as not proving something or other, something that rarely has anything to
do with the central argument.  You know for certain that if they had
such a negative fact, they would be trumpeting it to the skies.  Instead
they pull these nits out of thin air in internet chat-room arguments
where they are essentially bamboozling people who don’t know what in
God's name they are talking about.  By the time anyone figures out where
they’re coming from, it’s too late, the chat room is already on to
something else.  </font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q. So what is the
central "intelligent design" argument?</b>  </font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A. It has come down
to the claim—-entirely unsupported—-that humans are so complex, that
they couldn’t have evolved to where they are, even in a million years.
Therefore—catch the rigorous logic of this—they must have been plunked
down by God in their present form 10,000 years ago.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q.  And your
rebuttal is?</b>   </font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A. My rebuttal is
quite simple.  They are completely wrong.  They do not understand
evolution or how it works.  But while the archeological record is clear,
it has been difficult to prove they are <i>theoretically</i>
wrong--until quite recently.  But now they have been proven completely
wrong—again—on their spurious scientific claims.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q. Namely…?</b>
  </font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A.  The theoretical
problem has been that of proving that evolution alone and without God’s
intervention, could produce a creature as different from apes and as
increasingly complex as a modern human.  It was a good
argument.  Although scientists believed in their hearts that this must
be so, they could not prove it.  Now they have.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>Scientists at the
Digital Evolution Laboratory at Michigan State University have developed
and are running a program called </font><font size=2>
<a href="http://dllab.caltech.edu/avida/">
<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Avida</font></a></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>.
Avida starts with the representation of a simple life-form, and then
applies Darwin’s laws to it.  That is, the program allows these digital
life-forms to replicate, mutate, compete with one another for energy
(“food”).  They are then allowed to mutate.  The trick is to realize
that some huge percentage—let’s say 99.999%--of all mutations are
neutral or harmful.  They don’t add any advantage to an organism, or
they add a disadvantage.  Since those neutral or harmful mutations don’t
confer any advantage, life-forms in which they occur don’t have any
special advantage in carrying out Darwin’s laws: they don’t replicate
better, they can’t get food more easily and they don’t live longer.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>However, every once
in a blue moon, and by absolute sheer chance, a mutation does incur
an advantage.  Those life-forms in which this happens now do have a
survival advantage: They are better at finding food, they are
stronger to prevent others from stealing their food, they are able to
replicate more prolifically.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>It is thus easy to
visualize that the life-forms which have gained this advantage will more
likely replicate than ones which have no advantage, and much more so
than those who have incurred a negative advantage.  And since mutations
are heritable, the advantage will be passed on to the offspring. </font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q.  So the
negative ones tend to die out, and the positive ones thrive?</b>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A. Exactly.  </font><font size=2><a href="http://www.literature.org/authors/darwin-charles/the-origin-of-species/"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Darwin's

Up to the present, when there are only a few competing strains left.

subject.  One is quite enough for this discourse.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q.  But I’m still
not sure I get the point of Avida.</b>  </font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A.  Well, it should
be clear.  Avida has shown that the <i>mechanics</i> of evolution can,
by itself, provide a race of creatures with an ever-improving gene
pool.  A gene-pool that slowly improves a species to a very high level.
Not by divine intervention, but by simple chance as a blind, reactive
responses to a hostile environment.  It just takes an enormous amount of
time and many, many attempts, but both the mechanics and now the theory
has been shown to exist and to work as Darwin has claimed. But we don't
have to argue about it.  Go to the </font><font size=2>

website, download the program and try it yourself.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q. Which leaves
the intelligent design theory where?</b>   </font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A. With one tiny
off-limits section, it demolishes it.  Natural Darwinian evolution has
been shown by physical evidence to be correct, and now it has been shown
by theoretical evidence to be correct.  That does not leave much room
for competing theories that have neither.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q.  By
“theoretical” you mean…?</b>   </font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A. By theoretical I
do not mean “maybe.”  I mean a systematic, organized and logically
rigorous explanation.  Which includes exculpatory evidence. And in this
case, one that is thoroughly validated by the archeological record. I
also do not mean a perfect explanation, which is what the Creationists
demand for all but themselves.  The tiny off-limits splinter is their
"watch-maker" theme.  It is possible that a supreme being set the
universe in motion, with its physical laws and all.  But there is
absolutely no way of proving, or disproving that idea. Therefore it
cannot be discussed sensibly. And once watches are designed, built and
set running, the watchmakers no longer intervene.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q. Well, as a
last ditch try, what about “punctuated evolution”?</b>   </font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A.  That is, as you
say, a last-ditch effort to salvage some small part of creative design.
The short answer is "So what?"  In fact, evolution <u>is</u> punctuated
to some degree.  Since mutations are entirely random, there is no
telling when positive ones will occur, if ever.  A long time can go on
before positive ones occur.  And they may not occur sufficiently to
rescue a species whose environment is changing.  That species may become
extinct.  We may become extinct.  It is also possible that various
species have reached the acme of their “design.”  That is, there are no
mutations that can improve upon them, given their environment.  They
have perfectly adapted to it, and no change will render an advantage.
However,  environments generally do change—look at the human
environment—and so there will always be this jockeying for advantage.
The evolution of the human race is not finished, by a long shot.  </font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q. Finally, where
does this leave organized religion?</b>  </font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A. Yes, the $64
question. Well, the ideological elements of religions—most forms of
Islam, many forms of Judaism and Christianity--will probably die out, if
its adherents don’t first kill everyone who disagrees with them.  </font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q. And that
leaves…?</b>  </font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A.  And that leaves
<i>evolving</i> religions.  Religions that are open-ended; religions
that keep asking the cosmic questions.  Religions that have cast off the
curse of ideology. These can be Islamic, Jewish and Christian—-altered,
of course by rejecting the straightjacket of orthodoxy--but pretty much
valid, none the less. In fact, they may look like recognizable sisters
of today's incarnations.  But adherents must realize that all religions
are man-made, just as Jesus' ministry was, so we must look to inspired
men for direction.  Men like Jesus.</font>

will be dytropic-—that is become more complex--eventually leading to
humans.  For Christians, that leaves only two questions remaining: What
about Jesus Christ, and where does that leave organized religion?</b>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A.  I mentioned
earlier that I would eventually address the organized religion
question.  The question of who Jesus Christ was, has finally been
convincingly answered by Graham Phillips in his fascinating book, </font><font size=2><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1591430437/102-7247392-5862546?v=glance"><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">The
virgin Mary conspiracy: the true father of Christ and the tomb of the
virgin</font></i></a></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>
.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>Phillips’ research
highlights some of the severe stumbling blocks to the orthodox
description of who and what Jesus was.  First, leaving the “miracles”
aside, let’s look at some of the obvious <i>rational</i> flaws of their
Christian tale:  </font></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>1.       We are
asked to believe that a humble carpenter’s son with essentially no
education was able to preach in the Temple and astound the learned
rabbis.  This is beyond unlikely.  Of course whenever an overblown
tale like this is told, it means two things: First, it is a cover-up
of what would otherwise be an obvious flaw in the story--a
“scripting weakness” would be the modern appellation; and secondly,
the mechanism to perform the cover-up is to repeatedly invoke the
power of God—<i>deus ex machina.</i> "God said so.  End of story,"
is the way the Evangelicals love to put it.  In other words stop
thinking and shut up.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>2.       Leaving
aside the simple mistranslation of the “virgin” who gave  birth—we
know the correct translation is “young girl”—Jesus’ mother is
venerated in the huge role as “co-redeemer” with Christ of mankind’s
sins.  Why? This for a person who plays no theological role in
Jesus’ philosophy whatever. Indeed, Jesus fell out with his mother
over his teaching. Why? Other than being present at his birth, his
wedding and his death she plays no role in the scriptures at all.
In fact, her entire theological stature was constructed centuries
after the fact.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>3.
Incredibly, in a religion so fixated on “the Father,” Jesus’
scriptural father—Joseph--is even more invisible, having done
nothing except—presumably--teach Jesus to hew wood. In a real Jewish
family, the father is responsible for teaching the child religion,
yet we hear not a word about this or any other influence
whatsoever.  Why? That these questions are not even raised, much
less answered, points to the acute discomfort Christian theologians
have in probing the fragility of their religious construct. They are
terrified of what would happen if they  learned anything new about a
father, because his actions would be the most obvious ones to cast
doubt on their virgin birth claim.  Without the virgin birth, the
entire structure of their Christian argument would come tumbling
down. Jesus would be just another radical itinerant preacher. </font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>4.
Finally, what is the meaning of the scenario of Jesus riding into
Jerusalem on an ass but blatant stage-managing?  It cannot possibly
mean he is deliberately reenacting prophecies to an audience <u>in
order</u> to be crowned King of the Jews.  Jewish law is very strict
in this regard. The only way to be seriously considered King of the
Jews is by paternity—not by Hollywood enactment. Without a clear
line of <u>hereditary succession</u>, all the play-acting in the
world won’t carry the weight. Only with a provable line of
succession do the reenactments then become necessary prophetic
fulfillments. Thus, the only reason Jesus bothered to reenact the
prophecies was <i>because he could prove his lineage.</i>   </font>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q.  You said “his
wedding”?</b>   </font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A.  Possibly. There
was no reason for Jesus not to have been married except it doesn't fit
in with the revised versions of Christianity which doesn't like any form
of sexual activity to blemish its leaders.  The bible is a lot like an
ambitious businessman's resume; over the years the blemishes have been
airbrushed out, and positive accomplishments burnished to a fine
luster.  Jesus was in his 30’s after all, well past the age when a
Jewish rabbi would have been expected to get married.  One historical
clue is the wedding scene in Luke where he rebukes his mother for
haranguing the servants.  A guest to a wedding is not likely to do that,
but the mother of the groom is.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>But to continue.
What Graham Phillips posits is very exciting.  He shows convincingly
that Jesus must have been the (biological) son of Antipater, who himself
was the son of the real King of the Jews--Herod.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q. Herod?  The
same guy who tried to kill Jesus along with all the other newborns of
Bethlehem?</b>   </font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A.  The same.  Herod
really was the official King of the Jews, so anointed by no less than
the emperor Augustus. After his death, Augustus was then promoted to
being a god; thus this decree could not be revoked.  Antipater was
Herod’s eldest son and next in line to succeed his father.  (BTW,
Antipater’s wife was named Miriamne—-Greek for Mary.)  But Salome,
Herod’s sister, began to plot to eliminate Antipater in the line of
succession in favor of  a younger son of Herod’s,  Phillip.  Phillip was
a pliable lad, easy for Salome to control and through him, she
hoped, the Kingdom of Palestine.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>Salome inflamed
Herod’s already slipping sanity against Antipater by falsifying a plot
by Antipater to kill Herod in order to speed up the accession.  </font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>Because this newly
discovered paternity of Jesus changes the story of Herod to his hunting
down of possible <i>legal</i> usurpers to his throne (as opposed to
spiritual usurpers), the story of Herod killing all newborns in
Bethlehem finally makes sense. There are only two candidates that could
usurp Herod: Antipater, and Antipater’s yet to be first born son.  The
warning to Herod that Antipater’s pregnant wife was on her way to
Bethlehem was all the evidence Herod needed to confirm in his mind that
a plot to replace him was afoot. Thus, the paranoid Herod ordered his
own son Antipater and his family arrested.  Herod had Antipater killed
in his cell, but his wife, the pregnant Mary, escaped.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>This royal lineage
puts the story of Jesus’ life in an entirely different—and finally
believable--light.  Not a humble carpenter’s son picked by God out of
the blue, Jesus was of royal blood and in direct line to accession of
the throne by Roman decree.  Mary knew full well that her son by
Antipater was legally in line to take on the title of King of the Jews.
But to rule effectively, he could not do so as an untutored youth. His
mother, Mary, also high-born, clearly had big plans for her son. (This
is a discovery that Phillips does not pursue adequately. That Jesus was
essentially of royal blood has profound implications for the entire
Jesus legend. But Phillips was on a different spur.  He wanted to find
out what happened to Mary after the crucifixion of her son.)</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>How did Phillips
glean Jesus’ paternity with such certitude?  By a careful reading of the
Gospels. When Pontius Pilate directly asks Jesus, “Art thou the King of
the Jews?”, Jesus hems and haws and eventually answers: “To this end I
was born.”  Instead of crucifying Jesus immediately for making the false
claim of being a direct descendant of Herod, Pilate--amazingly--finds
“in him no fault in him at all.”  Such a judgment can <u>only</u> be a
result of Jesus indeed being a direct descendent of Herod, and that is
<u>only</u> possible if he is Antipater’s first son. Case closed. Of
course the orthodoxy jump through hoops to spin this answer
differently.  If you really want to see some dizzying spin, look at some
of the incredible, completely nonsensical genealogies proposed for
Jesus.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>Escaping from
Herod’s grasp, Mary married Joseph to help raise the young Jesus as the
next in line to succession. Since the prophets foretold (i.e., required)
that the Messiah be born in Bethlehem (forget the “census” ploy--Mary's
home was Nazareth, not Bethlehem). Mary and Joseph traveled there not by
angelic instruction, but specifically in order to fulfill that Old
Testament requirement, to set Jesus up for his secular role.  Warned of
his infanticidal decree by Essene elders, the new family once again
escaped Herod’s grasp--this time with the infant Jesus--by fleeing out
of reach to Egypt. Herod died soon thereafter making it safe for the
family to return to their actual home town of Nazareth.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>Once an adolescent,
Jesus was inducted into the rigorously orthodox Jewish Essene sect.
Located at Qumran on the banks of the Dead Sea, this was supposedly the
spiritual West Point of Jewish orthodoxy.  It is here that he received
his extensive theological training, all part of an upbringing designed
to let him reign successfully when he was ready to claim his rightful
title. He may at this time have impressed some rabbis at the Temple with
his theological precocity. His life and study at this strict religious
commune accounts for the so-called “missing years” of Jesus’ life.
These years are “missing” only insofar as they the orthodoxy doesn't
want to know about them.  They offend the regnant fairy tale that Jesus
was a humble lamb, designated by God to fulfill the forthcoming
Christian mission, instead of a highly trained rabbi, endowed by royal
lineage to succeed Herod’s reign. <b>One major unanswered question:
Could Joseph, Jesus' step father, have been Joseph of Arimathea?)</b>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q. This is all so
fantastic…</b>   </font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A. Oh, come now, not
at all.  Herod’s vicious behavior was standard fare for all the many
internecine plots amongst royals of every nation state since as long as
history has been recorded. Look at the way the English kings murdered
their wives and family members to gain advantage.  It was routine fare.
What <i>is</i> fantastic—that is, a fantasy—is the improbable concoction
the orthodoxy asks us to believe about Jesus.  No motives, no real
people fighting savagely for dominance, no authentic historicity. Just a
bunch of extras without a script, standing around waiting for the hero
to speak his lines. And then there are all the large holes in Jesus’
official biography--the so-called missing years, the fates of his mother
and father—-which no Christians seem to care enough about to find out
what happened.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q.  But why not?</b>
  </font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A.  Because the
natural answers, the historical answers, are not palatable. They leave
the Walt Disney God out of the equation. They make the Jesus story mere
history instead of a physical singularity.  But when you do find out
what really happened, you realize instantly that that Phillips’
historical scenario makes eminent sense. It shows up the sham that is
orthodox Christianity like the close examination of a Hollywood set.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q.  So once again
you come back to the claim that modern Christianity is a fraud.</b>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A.  Well, I come
back to the fact that modern Christianity has lost its way-—almost from
the beginning. Certainly no one can any longer claim with a straight
face that Jesus’ biography, as told in the gospels is historical.
But–and this really is The  Great Betrayal of the Christian
orthodoxy--instead of taking the genius behind these heavily edited
stories of Jesus into both hands, and trying to discover what it was
that Jesus actually meant, and who he actually was, the usual corporate
mentality took over. <i> <b>Today's orthodox Christianity is a huge
failure of the imagination.</b> </i>The result is a watered-down
confabulation that serves only its grasping creators and bears little if
any relationship to the life and teachings of Jesus Christ.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>The amount of
bafflegab that has been used to try to smooth over clearly contrary
facts in the bible to fit current "infallibility" theology, the
intellectual fraud necessary to twist ideas around to make them fit
modern concepts, all this just kept building up over the centuries,
encrusting Jesus’ teachings with everything from anti-female sexism to
murderous intolerance and torture in the name of Christ, to ingrained
pedophilia.  How much farther from Christ’s teachings could orthodox
religions possibly have traveled? Where are the modern Martin Luther's
to say, <b>"Now just a bloody minute"?  </b></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>Ask your self  how
much practical research about Jesus has been conducted by the Church?
Nearly all useful information about early Christianity is recent and
stems from historians and archeologists, with the orthodoxy fighting an
ever weaker rear-guard action.  Of late, the orthodoxy has just given
up.  They don’t even bother to answer new research issues and have
retreated to the sanctity of a complete religious fantasy. The
creationists and the biblical literalists have joined the orthodox

the last part, you claim that, according to Graham Phillips, Jesus was
an historical figure of royal blood, the issue of  Herod’s first son
Antipater and Mary, and in direct line of succession to Herod’s title of

Emperor, Augustus. Therefore all the rigmarole about virgin birth, a

the miracles.  Only the supernatural miracles. They cannot be true.  If
there is a God, he would not allow it.  I have been struggling with how
best to answer this.  Here is a try.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>First, the words of
the four Gospels are clear about what the religion of Jesus was—and it
was certainly not a huge corporate edifice with layers of priests,
cardinals, bishops and a pope/king. Nor did Jesus envision the need for
an intermediary to facilitate a person's relationship with God. The
religion of Jesus was a simple one of preaching, poverty, helping the
poor, and spreading the word of God.  The “lifestyle” of his group was
one of renouncing all worldly goods, and taking to the road to cure the
spiritual ills of the countryside.  They sponged-off the people they
preached to. They lived in communes and shared everything.
They undoubtedly married and the women probably accompanied their
itinerate preacher husbands on their missions. Not a very glamorous
life, and an extraordinary path for a real king to take. This is one
fact that makes the story of Jesus so astonishing--and so full of hope.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>The rich do not
qualify.  Jesus said it is easier to thread a rope through the eye of a
needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Thus he
renounced his high social standing, much to the consternation of his
family and the Essene community.  This again is an unexamined aspect of
his teachings that cries for further explication.  It is also certain
that Jesus was able to effect many “miraculous” cures of the then common
afflictions-—disfiguring skin ailments, hysteria and the like.  The
power of the placebo effect, particularly with skin ailments, while
scientifically well-documented, is even today not at all understood. The
ability of some people to trigger such cures is also quite remarkable,
but Jesus was not alone in that gift.  Numerous countryside preachers of
the times had similar abilities.  Their many historical accounts—-also
including virgin births, healing the disfigured, raising people from the
dead, etc.--are carefully left out of Christian orthodox history,
because they make Jesus seem like just one of many charismatic
preachers, which is what he was.  The orthodoxy, fearful that Jesus'
radical message is not enough--which is what is so remarkable about the
man--and one they themselves barely understand, ignore it in order to
pile on the social-security aspect of a heavenly retirement community.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>But, if Jesus' type
of Christianity is what you wish to pursue, there are still a few
options.  Jewish communes still exist, but they are generally not the
hippy life of love, peace and joy that Jesus’ group also did not
experience.  Rather, too many of them degenerated into snake pits of
rivalries, jealousies, intolerance and hatred—and failed to sustain
themselves as businesses, dissolving in acrimonious bankruptcy.  They
gave the early Christianity life-style a bad name. The ones that still
exist are strictly regulated by long lists of petty rules. Bitter
complaints about the other guy malingering, are part of everyday life.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>I have imagined a
modern version of the early Christian community that might be  closer to
Jesus’ idea, and one that might work today.  As an assemblage of
traveling preachers, Jesus' group didn’t exist long enough—only about
1-1/2 years--with him as leader, to indicate whether it possessed a
stable framework to hold together by anything other than the force of
his personality. In fact, almost immediately after his death, the Jesus
group morphed into several different variations.  His half-brother
James--a brother presumably sired by Joseph and Mary—-was a high priest
of the Jerusalem Temple (more evidence of Mary’s highborn standing), and
led the initially strongest Jesus movement.  But it was solely open to
Jews. Paul (who never met Jesus) picked up the gauntlet and opened
Christianity up to gentiles. As such, he--not Peter--is the real father
of the modern Christian orthodoxy.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>I call this
hypothetical self-governing form of Ur-Christianity <i>The</i> <i>
Followers of Jesus,</i> or simply “Followers.” Here it is:  </font></p>
<blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>Followers
are obliged to join professions that help their fellow man,
especially in such jobs as nurses, doctors, teachers, the
ministry, policemen and the like.  They might join Doctors
without Borders, or the Salvation Army.  They could teach in
prisons.  They might work in hospitals for the poor or in mental
institutions.  If you want to live a glamorous life, try a later
version of Christianity. </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>Wherever
they work, Followers have their paychecks deposited directly
into a central Followers’ accounts. </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>Followers
are themselves paid a living wage which is based on a sliding
scale. The lowest paid Followers receive nearly all of what they
would have taken home.  As they earn more, an ever greater
portion of their earnings is retained by the administration.  A
successful surgeon might receive only 25% of his net pay back.
This engenders an appreciation of poverty and discourages those
joining who lust to accumulate wealth and earthly power. No
Follower drives a BMW.  Followers who pay-in 75% or more of
their earnings are highly esteemed and play a special role in
the community. </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>In return
for this sliding scale of pre-take-home tithes, the central
administration provides its own network of churches, medical
care, schools and a retirement fund. </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>Local
congregations are formed with ministers chosen by election.
Ministers serve 5-year renewable terms, but can be recalled by a
2/3rds vote of their congregation. These ministers form the
board of directors of the Executive Committee. </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>The board
of directors oversee the Executive Committee, which runs the
show.  The Committee directs the prudent investment of the
accumulating capital which is used to fund the creation and
operation of hospitals and schools, and the cost of medical care
for the flock as well as the funding of their retirement
benefits. Retirement communities are created and maintained.
And, of course, they fund their extensive good works.  </font>
</li>
<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>To avoid
complaints of elitism, the Followers’ hospitals and schools
operated as "profit centers," open on a minority basis to
non-Followers. Instruction follows the Catholic school model,
i.e., strict, non-union, and secular with an added religious
component. </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>All
Followers not directly involved in care-giving careers must
perform some sort of on-going community service. </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A strange
rite is required of all those who form the Executive Committee:
they must all be medically castrated!  This has been found to
reduce the testosterone-fuelled lust for power, and is certainly
a bar to anyone who seeks the honor for the wrong reason.  In
one sense, selective castration of the executive leaders
replaces the Jewish custom of universal male circumcision.
</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>
Intermarriage of a Follower and a non-follower is not
discouraged, but the non-Follower partner must abide by
the rules of the Group—although he or she is not obligated to
join or “believe.”  A non-member can attend services but may not
become a minister unless she does convert. </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>Finally, <i>
the rules of the Followers cannot over-ride the democratic laws
of the land in which they dwell.</i> There is no higher earthly
authority than the democratic law of the land. This is always a
bitter pill to swallow when abortion comes up, or polygamy, etc.
As a follower, you may <u>chose</u> personally not to have an
abortion; you may <u>counsel</u> others not to have an abortion;
but you may not <u>force</u> or try to force anyone not to have
an abortion if the law allows it.   </font></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>What do the
Followers <i>believe</i>?  Religious beliefs are not really taught; <b>
only religious  behavior is</b>. Act out the ten Commandments. Some of
the habits Jesus and his disciples had were to eat communal meals as
part of their religious fellowship.  This is carried over into the
informal services held by the churches. A Mid-day dinner is the focus of
the Sunday service. The essence of this group’s beliefs is that they
must <i>act</i> correctly in God’s eyes. <b>Switching good actions in
favor of good beliefs was the greatest perversion of Jesus’ teachings
that can be imagined.</b>   It permitted the orthodoxy to do <i>anything</i> as
long as could claim to be doing it "in the name of the Lord." The result
was the Inquisition.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>And, or course, the
biggest problem facing these Ur-Christians is the same one that faced
the Bolsheviks--how do you prevent a socialistic system like this from
turning into an out-of-control dictatorship? The Bolshies quickly
consolidated power among a small clique by eliminating democracy--and
brutally eliminating the slightest competition. Because they were
decisive, they were very effective in the short term.  But, because they
were anti-democratic they could not compete in the long term. Any
elections were complete frauds. Elections amongst the Followers are a
very serious business.  Everyone must vote; the voting is supervised by
an outside agency--many agencies, actually, and the outcome is quickly
enforced: losers are cast out of office the next week. Recalcitrants are
dealt with harshly...</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>To be considered
“Followers of Jesus,” adherents must <i>act</i> according to Jesus’
commands, and attempt to follow his example.  This thesis has been
well-explicated by Robert Funk, founder of the </font><font size=2>
<a href="http://www.westarinstitute.org/Jesus_Seminar/jesus_seminar.html">
<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Jesus Seminar</font></a></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>
.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>Essentially, Funk
realized that in spite of the vocabulary later used to describe it,
Jesus’ heaven was right here on Earth.  Jesus’ view of the committed
life was so different, so outside the box, that there exists no
vocabulary to describe it. Those like Jesus, who have glimpsed it, are
pushed into using what words they have, a vocabulary that offends normal
sensibilities.  Listen to born-again Christians rant.  But, instead of
an earthly here-and-now filled with grace, the disciples thought they
heard a description of another physical place.  Instead of the suffering
the slings and arrows of this cruel world full of ugliness, temptation,
and hatred, Christian acolytes understood a celestial haven, free from
these sins and especially free of Roman persecution.  You can imagine
why: Proselytizers quickly picked up on the fact that it is easier to
pitch a heavenly eternal spa than a mere different way of looking at
ugly life here on earth.  They began the ionization of Christ--failing
to see, to appreciate, his hard, down-to-earth message in favor of a
glistening Disney World.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>But, the
self-abnegation and personal sacrifice the Followers demand would be a
difficult religion for most people to practice today—-as it surely was
in Christ’s time. So most of us must find a different way to serve
Him.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q.  But wait.
You mean there are “Followers,” and there are “Followers-Lite”?</b>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A.  Of course. Being
entirely man-made, people create and live the religion they want.
Today’s’ Christians religions are glorified social clubs with faint
religious overtones. The Salvation Army is one terrific response to
keeping Jesus' mission alive. Except that they are universally
liberal--religion and politics shouldn't mix-- the Quakers are a modest
attempt to keep the faith. Even the Masons, the Shiners and the Rotary
Clubs do as much for the poor as organized religions—perhaps more--and
at least they don't kill anyone.  They are churches without
religion, that help the poor.  They are the direction all religions must
head.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q. You used the
term “to serve Christ.”  What exactly do you mean by that?</b>   </font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A.  Surely that is
the central core of Christianity.  If you believe Jesus was the Son of
God--which is marvelous simile--then the question each Christian must
answer for himself is this: To what extant can I obey the dictates of
Jesus? There is nothing else to think about. Of course everyone provides
his own answer on a sliding scale. We will leave for later his commands
to <i>believe</i> any particular thing.  His commands of action are what
count--the action to love your neighbors, the act of turning the other
cheek to your enemies. To actually honor your mother and father in deed
and not merely in thought. And most of all—in my opinion--to <i>give of
yourself</i>—not just money--to your spouse and children, to your
parents and neighbors, to your fellow man in general, and and especially
to those less well-off than you.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q.  That’s all?</b>
 </font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A.  That’s a lot.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q.  But what
about all the religious imagery, the rituals, the hymns of praise, the
prayers of thanksgiving, the glorification of the saints…?</b>    </font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A.  Well, those make
you feel good, but how does all that help the poor? </font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q.  That’s it?
You’ve reduced “Christianity-Lite” to helping the poor?</b>    </font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A.  That’s not a bad
reduction.  As to hymns of praise, they serve to make us feel good about
ourselves, which is a large part of what religion is there for.   </font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><b>Q. And where does
God fit in?</b>   </font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A.  God doesn't "fit
in."  God is unknowable. However, we know what he isn’t.  He isn’t a
heavenly Santa Claus that makes exceptions to his own house rules just
because some one spends a lot of time on bended knee.  <i>If prayer
worked at all, its advantages would show up statistically.  </i>Devout
Christians would suffer less cancer, have fewer heart attacks, and lose
fewer children in accidents.  If prayer worked at all, theologians would
have a thousand studies to prove that being a Christian is healthier
than being a Muslim or an atheist.  But they don’t even do those
studies, which means they don’t even believe in the efficacy of that
kind of prayer themselves.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>And we do have some
idea of what God is.  Imagine you are in an airliner.  You just locked
yourself into the rear loo when suddenly the plan starts twisting and
turning violently.  You can’t get back to your seat.  The plane crash
lands; the tail section with you in it, breaks off. Dazed, but unhurt,
you jump to the ground, only to see the fuselage--200 yards down the
field--burning fiercely.  None of the emergency exits are open.
Everybody has been burned alive—-except you.  What do you do now?  What
do you think?  Most people would drop to their knees, burst out in
tears, and blurt out: “Thank God I’m alive.”  </font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>“Thank God I’m
alive.” The same person who five minutes ago, in the process of
explaining to his seat-mate that “God is Dead” is struck with diarrhea
and is now on his knees thanking the Lord for sparing him.  So, in spite
of all our learned cerebration, this <u>idea</u> of a supreme deity is
firmly anchored in the mind of man.  We use his name repeatedly--he
permeates our language: “For God’s sake;” “God dammit;” “God forsaken;”
God is such a<i> necessary idea;</i> his teachings are the focal point
of the diffuse light of our lives, and he is the lens.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>But man, the
thinking animal, never gives up trying to define God, or pigeon-hole
him, or appropriate him.  The latter is especially true of  the
theocrats who claim an exclusive knowledge of God, and suggest that they
alone control his appointment book.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>In the final
analysis, it is nearly useless to try to talk about God, to try to
define him or explain who or what he is.  Let’s go back to the radical
idea that religion is kind deeds, not any belief; and what you believe
about God—-or anything—-is entirely your own business—-and not that of
the Church or the State.  Then each person can work out for himself who
and what his or her God is. You needn’t look further; if there is a God
for you,  He--not a priest or some unnamed university professor--will
help you come to terms with Him.  Amen.</font>

further than he, a wise man, but not much further.  But let us first set
the scene. While not yet clear to everyone, the battle lines about the
place of God and man in today’s society have been drawn and the fight is
on in earnest.  To see what it is that the two sides are fighting about,
let us review the reason for any battle. It is not to place God in or

<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>According to their
scriptures, the God of Judaism, of Christianity and of Islam is
the ruler of the universe and the source of all power, Earthly and
Celestial.  And we also know that throughout history, many (Greek &amp;
Roman) gods were replaced by a single God, who was slowly replaced by a
mortal god, e.g., Louis XIV, the Emperor of Japan, Mao Tse-tung, Stalin,
Hitler, etc.  Now, in advanced nations, it is “Power to the
People”–democracy--that rules the roost. So the idea of where ultimate
power lies has devolved downward from many heavenly gods to a single
heavenly god to a single god-like person on earth, and thence, to many
people on Earth--to everyman. In a democracy, no matter what your
religion is, all human actions are subject to the will of the people
and, in that sense, “God is dead.”</font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2>A. Oh come now.  I said
you don’t understand the calculus of force. Try to understand it.
Understand that the result you are looking for is one that causes the <u>
least</u> amount of destruction in order to achieve your goal.  The
rapid application of overwhelming force is usually the cheapest way to
get there. If you aren’t ready to apply maximum force to achieve a
difficult result–democracy to replace a cruel theocracy--then don’t even
get started in the first place. And doing nothing is almost always more
expensive than avoiding regrettably “cruel” action now in hopes that
something gentler and kinder will appear on the horizon. Indeed, the use
of overwhelming force is the backbone of the U.S. Armed Forces Military
Doctrine–except that it’s never used by them any more–and that’s why the
American can’t make any progress in Iraq.  If you can get over the moral
issue, the Germans in WW-II understood the correct use of force. They
practiced then what the American military preaches now. Of course
Americans have such trouble getting over the moral issue, as opposed to
the technical issue.  But Vietnam certainly showed the world that it
doesn’t matter how powerful you are; if you aren’t willing to use as
much force as necessary to get the job done, you might as well stay home
and polish your weaponry for the parade ground.</font>

This separation is, of course a very bitter pill for the religiously
intense to swallow and, indeed, they will never swallow it voluntarily.
If allowed to come to power, they will do everything in their power to
replace democratic institutions with undemocratic religious
institutions. Today Catholics and Jews would, if they could, reinstall
God as the Central Authority, with the priests and Rabbis as
interlocutors.  That is, they will steal power from the people and
accrete it for themselves.  All in the name of God. That is why (coming

While orthodox theologians have been deliberating, dissecting and
heavily embellishing the scanty accounts of Jesus' life, modern <i>
independent</i> theologians have been slowly coming to a different
conclusion.  The most recent hypotheses suggest that <i>nothing</i> was
written about Jesus before about 90 AD (See </font></span>

and that the strongest evidence of his existence--the letters of St.
Paul--are mid 2nd Century forgeries ("pseudoipigraphs"). Jewish elders,
worried about the influence of Julius Caesar, created Jesus as a
theological counter-weight.  This deliberate legend was tried out in
various versions, each new edition modifying and "purifying" the tale a
bit further, until a group of stories came together that told roughly
the same story--which became the synoptic gospels. Thus, the Jesus Myth
was designed by Jews to give Jews a super-hero around which to rally.
They did too good a job. <i> Christ</i>-ianity was then pre-empted
by Roman leaders as a very handy framework around which
to construct--over many centuries--the official Roman
religion--Catholicism.  Objecting to the resulting Italian theological
(and military) dictatorship, democratically-inclined German theists
wanted their own version, and split with the mother church to create it.
Thus was born a third major variation of the Jesus Myth--Protestantism.
(Others broke off from Roman Catholicism, too--the Greeks, the
Armenians, etc.)  All proving, modern theologians point out, that
religion is essential man-made, and nothing will stop the people from
creating the religion they want. </font></span>

<b>Why is this important to any but the Christians themselves?</b> After
all, in free countries, people can <i>believe</i> whatever they want (as
long as they do not <i>act</i> against the democratic laws of the
land).  It matters because if there was no super-natural event (A
here-and-now God, the insemination by God of a virgin, etc.), then the
claim by Christians to certain "inalienable rights"--such as a
prohibition against abortion--becomes just another special pleading by
just another pressure group, and cannot automatically supersede as
"higher law" the secular law of the land.  (This does not mean
Christians cannot agitate against abortion, and try to reverse the legal
rulings that allow it.  But those are then merely self-serving political
acts, and not a defense of "God's will.")  </font></span>

there was a way to prove that God did set the universe in motion in the

to believe in a God that is caring, that is present in the here and now,
that watches over every sparrow, and that can and does intervene when it
suits him. So one strongly suspects that Creationists are merely using
the Watchmaker idea as the camel's nose under the tent--a way to stay in
the science game so that later, when they are no longer scrutinized,
they can "expand" the Watchmaker theory to include their literal
biblical  interpretations.  This is a devious tactic of which
Creationists should be ashamed.  But, as ideologues, they believe that

  Perfect.  That is exactly what the orthodoxy of all religions should
be doing.  But they are far too lazy, much too comfortable and set in
their ways.  Their intellectuals are too frightened and too timid to do
their theological job, which is to interpret what their founding
fathers--real humans all--thought and believed about man's ultimate
destiny. Such a pity.  The job will eventually get done, but it means it
will be left to social scientists who will probably be atheists.  What a
scandal--theologians are too oafish to explain themselves, so outsiders
will have to do the job for them. See </font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=2><a href="http://www.egodeath.com/TheFabricatedPaul.htm">Hermann
