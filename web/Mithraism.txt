Here's one religion's basic story: Over two thousand years ago on December 25 a baby was born to a virgin, who
was given the title “Mother of God.”&nbsp; The birth took place in humble surroundings, with shepherds in
attendance.&nbsp; The baby grew to be a man who had twelve followers.&nbsp; He taught morality and performed
miracles, including raising the dead and making the blind see.&nbsp; This man was known as “The Light of the
World,” “The Good Shepherd,” and “Mankind's Savior.”&nbsp; He took part in a last supper with his companions, was
killed and three days later resurrected.&nbsp; He then ascended into heaven where he protected the faithful from
above, was mediator between heaven and Earth, and was a member of a holy trinity.&nbsp; His followers practiced
purification thru baptism and also took part in a ceremony in which they drank wine and ate bread to symbolize
the blood and body of their savior.&nbsp; The savior's name was Mithras and the religion was Mithraism, which
had been a popular religion for several hundred years before Christianity began.<p>


It would be an oversimplification to suggest that Mithraism was the only basis for Christianity.
