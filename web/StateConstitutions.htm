<p><b>Arkansas State Constitution, Article 19 Section 1 ("Miscellaneous
Provisions")</b><br>
<i>No person who denies the being of a God shall hold any office in the civil
departments of this State, nor be competent to testify as a witness in any
court.</i></p>
<p><a href="http://www.mdarchives.state.md.us/msa/mdmanual/43const/pdf/const.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Maryland's
Declaration of Rights, Article 36</b></a><br>
"<i>That as it is the duty of every man to worship God in such manner as he
thinks most acceptable to Him, all persons are equally entitled to protection in
their religious liberty; wherefore, no person ought by any law to be molested in
his person or estate, on account of his religious persuasion, or profession, or
for his religious practice, unless, under the color of religion, he shall
disturb the good order, peace or safety of the State, or shall infringe the laws
of morality, or injure others in their natural, civil or religious rights; nor
ought any person to be compelled to frequent, or maintain, or contribute, unless
on contract, to maintain, any place of worship, or any ministry; nor shall any
person, otherwise competent, be deemed incompetent as a witness, or juror, on
account of his religious belief; <u>provided, he believes in the existence of
God,</u> and that under His dispensation such person will be held morally
accountable for his acts, and be rewarded or punished therefore either in this
world or in the world to come.</i>"</p>
<p><a href="http://www.state.ma.us/legis/const.htm#cart011.htm" target="_blank"><b>Massachusetts'
State Constitution, Article 3 </b></a><br>
"<i>Any <u>every denomination of Christians,</u> demeaning themselves
peaceably, and as good subjects of the commonwealth, shall be equally under the
protection of the law: and no subordination of any one sect or denomination to
another shall ever be established by law.</i>"<br>
<b>Comment: </b>Apparently Non-Christians are not "equally under the
protection of the law".</p>
