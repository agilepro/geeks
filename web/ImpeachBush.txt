Our Constitution says that Congress shall have the power to declare war.  Iraq has never been linked to Sept. 11, so the invasion of Iraq is an act of war; without explicit congressional approval it is unconstitutional. G. W. Bush should be impeached.

The U.S. has lost our moral position as leader of the free world.  We now lead by force.
