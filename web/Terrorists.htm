Gotta wonder...<br>

Terrorism.  Everyone seems to be wondering why the Arab terrorists are so quick to commit suicide?  Let's see now:<br>

No premarital sex.
No booze.
No bars.
No television.
No internet.
No organized sports, stadiums, tailgate parties.
Actually, no tailgates.<br>

No Hooters.
No meat from a pig.
Sand everywhere and not a dune buggy in sight.
Ever try to fish at an oasis?
Rags for clothes and hats.
Eating only with your right hand cause you wipe your butt only with your left. (Like life isn't complicated enough already.)<br>

Constant wailing from the guy next door because he is sick and there are no doctors.
No music.
No radio.
You can't shave.
You can't shower.
Bar-B-Q donkey cooked over burning camel dung.
The women have to wear baggy dresses and veils at all times.
Your bride is picked by someone else.<br>

Oh, .... and then they tell you... that when you die, it all gets better.<br>

Who wouldn't go for it?<p>
