<h2>The Sacrifice of Reason</h2>
<h3>By Sam Harris</h3>
Humanity has had a long fascination with blood
sacrifice. In fact, it has been by no means uncommon
for a child to be born into this world only to be
patiently and lovingly reared by religious maniacs
who believe that the best way to keep the sun on its
course or to ensure a rich harvest is to lead him by
tender hand into a field or to a mountaintop and
bury, butcher, or burn him alive as offering to an
invisible (and almost certainly fictional) God.<p>In
many ancient cultures whenever a nobleman died,
other men and women allowed themselves to be buried
alive so as to serve as his retainers in the next
world. In ancient Rome, children were sometimes
slaughtered so that the future could be read in
their entrails. The Dyak women of Borneo would not
even look at a suitor unless he came bearing a net
full of human heads as a love offering. Some Fijian
prodigy devised a powerful sacrament called
“Vakatoga” which required that a victim’s limbs be
cut off and eaten while he watched. Among the
Iroquois, captives from other tribes were often
permitted to live for many years, and even to marry,
all the while being doomed to be flayed alive as an
oblation to the God of War; whatever children they
produced while in captivity were disposed of in the
same ritual. African tribes too numerous to name
have a long history of murdering people to send as
couriers in a one-way dialogue with their ancestors
or to convert their body parts into magical charms.
Ritual murders of this sort continue in many African
societies to this day.
<p>It is essential to realize that such impossibly
stupid misuses of human life have always been
explicitly religious. They are the product of what
certain human beings think they know about invisible
gods and goddesses, and of what they manifestly do
<em>not</em> know about biology, meteorology,
medicine, physics, and a dozen other specific
sciences that have more than a little to say about
the events in the world that concern them.<br>

And it is astride this contemptible history of
religious atrocity and scientific ignorance that
Christianity now stands as an absurdly
unselfconscious apotheosis. As John the Baptist is
rumored to have said upon seeing Jesus for the first
time, “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the
sin of the world” (John 1:29). For most Christians,
this bizarre opinion still stands, and it remains
the core of their faith. Christianity amounts to the
claim that we must love and be loved by a God who
approves of the scapegoating, torture, and murder of
one man—his <em>son</em>, incidentally—in
compensation for the misbehavior and thought-crimes
of all others.<p>Let the good news go forth: we live
in a cosmos, the vastness of which we can scarcely
even indicate in our thoughts, on a planet teeming
with creatures we have only begun to understand, but
the whole project was actually brought to a glorious
fulfillment over twenty centuries ago, after one
species of primate (our own) climbed down out of the
trees, invented agriculture and iron tools, glimpsed
(as through a glass, darkly) the possibility of
keeping its excrement out of its food, and then
singled out one among its number to be viciously
flogged and nailed to a cross.
<p>The notion that Jesus Christ died for our sins
and that his death constitutes a successful
propitiation of a “loving” God is a direct and
undisguised inheritance of the scapegoating
barbarism that has plagued bewildered people
throughout history. Viewed in a modern context, it
is an idea at once so depraved and fantastical that
it is hard to know where to begin to criticize it.
Add to the abject mythology surrounding one man’s
death by torture—Christ’s passion—the symbolic
cannibalism of the Eucharist. Did I say “symbolic”?
Sorry, according to the Vatican it is most assuredly
not symbolic. In fact, the opinion of the Council of
Trent still stands:
<p><em>I likewise profess that in the Mass a true,
proper and propitiatory sacrifice is offered to God
on behalf of the living and the dead, and that the
body and blood together with the soul and divinity
of our Lord Jesus Christ is truly, really, and
substantially present in the most holy sacrament of
the Eucharist, and that there is a change of the
whole substance of the bread into the body, and of
the whole substance of the wine into blood; and this
change the Catholic Church calls transubstantiation.
I also profess that the whole and entire Christ and
a true sacrament is received under each separate
species.</em>
<p>Of course, Catholics have done some very
strenuous and unconvincing theology in this area, in
an effort to make sense of how they can really eat
the body of Jesus, not mere crackers enrobed in
metaphor, and really drink his blood without, in
fact, being a cult of crazy cannibals. Suffice it to
say, however, that a world view in which
“propitiatory sacrifices on behalf of the living and
the dead” figure prominently is rather difficult to
defend in the year 2007. But this has not stopped
otherwise intelligent and well-intentioned people
from defending it.
<p>And now we learn that even Mother Teresa, the
most celebrated exponent of this dogmatism in a
century, had her doubts about the whole story—the
presence of Christ in the Eucharist, the existence
of heaven, and even the existence of God:
<p><em>Lord, my God, who am I that You should
forsake me? The Child of your Love — and now become
as the most hated one — the one — You have thrown
away as unwanted — unloved. I call, I cling, I want
— and there is no One to answer — no One on Whom I
can cling — no, No One. — Alone ... Where is my
Faith — even deep down right in there is nothing,
but emptiness &amp; darkness — My God — how painful is
this unknown pain — I have no Faith — I dare not
utter the words &amp; thoughts that crowd in my heart —
&amp; make me suffer untold agony.
<p>So many unanswered questions live within me
afraid to uncover them — because of the blasphemy —
If there be God — please forgive me — When I try to
raise my thoughts to Heaven — there is such
convicting emptiness that those very thoughts return
like sharp knives &amp; hurt my very soul. — I am told
God loves me — and yet the reality of darkness &amp;
coldness &amp; emptiness is so great that nothing
touches my soul. Did I make a mistake in
surrendering blindly to the Call of the Sacred
Heart?</em><br>
— addressed to Jesus, at the suggestion of a
confessor, undated
<p>Teresa’s recently published letters reveal a mind
riven by doubt (as it should have been). They also
reveal a woman who was surely suffering from
run-of-the-mill depression, though even secular
commentators have begun to politely dress this fact
in the colors of the saints and martyrs. Teresa’s
response to her own bewilderment and hypocrisy (her
term) reveals just how like quicksand religious
faith can be. Her doubts about God’s existence were
interpreted by her confessor as a sign that she was
sharing Christ’s torment upon the cross; this
exaltation of her wavering faith allowed Teresa “to
love the darkness” she experienced in God’s apparent
absence. Such is the genius of the unfalsifiable. We
can see the same principle at work among her fellow
Catholics: Teresa’s doubts have only enhanced her
stature in the eyes of the Church, having been
interpreted as a further evidence of God’s grace.
<p>Ask yourself, when even the doubts of experts are
thought to confirm a doctrine, what could possibly
disconfirm it?
