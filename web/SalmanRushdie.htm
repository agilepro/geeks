<strong><h2>Before a Crowd of Hundreds and C-SPAN Cameras, Salman Rushdie
Defends Freedom to Blaspheme</h2>
<p>By Austin Dacey</strong>
<p>In a wide-ranging lecture and discussion presented by the Center for
Inquiry-<em>New York</em> on October 11, Salman Rushdie defended an
uncompromising right of blasphemy and diagnosed the failure of Western
liberals to confront Islamic radicalism. He began by describing his recent
efforts to defeat the passage of a law in Britain that would have made it
illegal to offend the religious sensibilities of fellow citizens,
commenting, "Islamaphobia a victimless crime. It must be, in any free
society, OK to be as open as you want to be about your dislike of a set of
ideas. Otherwise it becomes impossible to think. It becomes impossible to
have any kind of interchange of thoughts."
<p>Addressing Western liberals whose animus towards American foreign policy
leads them to seek allies among Islamist movements, Rushdie said, "Islamic
radicalism is not interested in creating a world of greater social justice.
It's not interested in liberating women. It's not interested in tolerance
for minorities and sexual dissidents. It's not interested in democracy. It's
not interested in economic redistribution. It's not interested in any of
things that you would call social justice. It's interested in what the
Taliban is interested in. It's interested in creating a new, religious,
fascist rule over the planet; the new caliphate, the talibanization of the
earth. For the left to refuse to understand the nature of the people that
they are refusing to criticize, is a historical mistake as great as those
who were the fellow travelers of Stalinist communist in an earlier age."
<p>Throughout, Rushdie was candid about his own unbelief, remarking,
"Religion will break your heart."
<p>The evening with Salman Rushdie was the first of the Center's <em>Voices
of Reason 2006-2007 series</em>, and its most successful public event to
date. Media coverage included <em>C-SPAN Book TV, CNN IBN</em> (an Indian
sister station), <em>WBAI, Democracy Now, Air America, the New York Observer</em>,
and others.
