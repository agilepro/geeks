<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Lt. Columbo</b>: All right sir, lemme see if I got this
straight: You say you were made by a Creator to look and be just like Him, is
that it?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Witness</b>: Yes Lieutenant, how many times do I have to
tell you?
<p><b>Lt. Columbo</b>: OK, so you got a mind and a brain just
like He does?
<p><b>Witness</b>: Yes, of course, mine works just like His,
but His is much bigger. See, He’s perfect in every way, He doesn’t make any
mistakes, and He knows everything. But that’s not the best part – the best part
is, he loves me, and I can’t tell you what a warm glow I get from that.
<p><b>Lt. Columbo</b> (squints and takes a puff of cigar):
Now, you say you were using that brain and ….
<p><b>Witness</b>: I used it a LOT, because He is always
telling me not to squander the talents He gave me and I spent a lot of time with
some other folks who were using theirs too
<p><b>Lt. Columbo</b>: And you say you discovered He couldn’t
possibly exist?
<p><b>Witness</b>: Yes
<p><b>Lt. Columbo</b>: When did you discover this?
<p><b>Witness</b>: It was about 3 in the morning a couple
weeks ago.
<p><b>Lt. Columbo</b>: Ok, so He gave you a brain, you used
the brain to figure out He wasn’t real—so what, sir, if I may ask, is exactly
the problem?
<p><b>Witness</b>: Threats
<p><b>Lt. Columbo </b>(raises eyebrow): What kind of threats?
<p><b>Witness</b>: He said He was going to pour gas on me and
set me on fire in front of my mother and wife and kids while they’re all at a
party at His mansion whooping it up.
<p><b>Lt. Columbo</b>: I know, we got the call down at the
station. We’re going to put a tail on Him and…
<p><b>Witness</b>: WAIT! Don’t do that!
<p><b>Lt. Columbo</b>: And why not, sir?
<p><b>Witness</b>: Cause there’s an out
<p><b>Lt. Columbo</b>: What do you mean an out?
<p><b>Witness</b>: He’s got a relative who is actually the
same person as Him. He told me He arranged to have the relative bumped off, but
see, the relative was only bumped off for a couple of days, then he wasn’t
bumped off any more, He did this all for me – like I said, He loves me -- and if
I bought this, and also ate a piece of the relative every now and then, He said
he would forget all about the gasoline thing. So, I’m thinking about it.
<p><b>Lt. Columbo</b> (squinting heavily): Ok, sir, let’s add
this all up: You were made by Mr. Perfect, He gives you the brain that’s a copy
of His, then He threatens to set you on fire for using the brain, even though He
loves you, &nbsp;then He changes His mind, has Himself bumped off to fix the mistake
that He made by making you, even though you say He doesn’t make mistakes, only
He knows ahead of time He’s not really bumped off, and even though the relative
didn’t do anything wrong and He thinks you <i>did, </i>if you buy this story,
and eat the relative, then you don’t get set on fire, is that right?
<p><b>Witness</b>: That’s about it, yes.
<p><b>Lt. Columbo</b> (shakes head slowly): OK sir, here’s my
card, you be sure and call us if you hear from Him again.
<p>(Turns and heads for door, then suddenly turns around)
<p>Oh…sir..just one more thing?
<p><b>Witness</b> (looking peeved): YES Lieutenant?
<p><b>Lt. Columbo</b>: Well sir, it’s just…I mean…when did He
tell you about this relative thing?
<p><b>Witness</b>: He didn’t tell me -- it’s all in a book I
have at home
<p><b>Lt. Columbo</b>: A book?
<p><b>Witness</b>: That’s what I said – is there anything
else?
<p><b>Lt. Columbo</b>: &nbsp;Yes sir, how do you know the book is
right?
<p><b>Witness</b>: BECAUSE, Lieutenant, it says right in the
book that the book is right, and so did the guy who gave it to me.
<p><b>Lt. Columbo</b> (grins and takes a long puff of cigar):
Well sir, I have to admit, for the first time… for the very first time -- I …am…
stumped.</p>

Columbo took off for Florida and was never seen around here again.</span>
