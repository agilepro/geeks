Flag Desecration Amendment (amended 17 times in more than 200 years) HJ Res. 4/SJ Res. 4,
holding prisoners as “enemy combatants” without charge

===========

While flag burning is rare, it can be a powerful and important form of free speech.  In fact, the proposed constitutional amendment would do irreparable harm to our right to free speech and undermine the very principles for which the American flag stands.  Those who favor the proposed amendment say they do so in honor of the flag.  But in proposing to unravel the First Amendment, they desecrate what the flag represents, and what millions of Americans have died to defend.

Jailing protesters is common under authoritarian regimes, not in America. I read that two young protesters in Hong Kong were arrested for burning the Chinese flag after mainland China took over control of the island nation. Cuban courts commonly jail dissidents who "dishonor" the Cuban flag. While jailing protesters might be common in totalitarian regimes, Americans expect -- and indeed have put their lives on the line -- to ensure that our right to free speech is not abridged.

Do not amend the First Amendment for the first time in history. Please oppose any effort to ban flag desecration.

The Bush Administration continues to hold prisoners as “enemy combatants” without charge -- thereby violating international law and the U.S. Constitution. If the government has evidence that an individual is involved with terrorism, there are other, better, legal options than detaining them without charge.
