<h1><p>Directions to Stanford University</h1>
<b>From Highway 280 North & South:</b><br>
Exit Sand Hill Road & go east toward Stanford.&nbsp; Continue past Pasteur and Vineyard, turning right at
Arboretum Rd.&nbsp; Go past Quarry and turn right on Palm Dr.&nbsp; At the end of Palm Dr. is the Oval.<p>
<b>From Highway 101 North & South:</b><br>
Take University Ave. south thru Palo Alto.&nbsp; At El Camino it changes name to Palm Drive and ends at the Oval.<br>
&raquo; or &laquo;<br>
Take the Embarcadero Road exit west toward Stanford.&nbsp; At El Camino Real, Embarcadero turns into Galvez
Street as it enters the campus.&nbsp; The next right is Arboretum Rd.&nbsp; Go two blocks and turn left on
Palm Dr.&nbsp; At the end of Palm Dr. is the Oval.<p>
I suggest that you take map printouts at zoom levels 2 & 4, as it can be easy to get lost on campus.<p>
