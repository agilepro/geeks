<h2>OUTSOURCING OF JOBS REACHES THE PRESIDENT</h2>

      Washington DC - Congress today announced that the Office of
President of the United States of America will be outsourced to overseas
interests as of June 30th, the end of this fiscal year.  The move is being
made to save not only a significant portion of the President's $400K yearly
salary, but also a record $521 Billion in deficit expenditures and related
overhead.

    "We believe this is a wise move financially. The cost savings should
be significant" stated Congressman Thomas Reynolds (R-Wash).   Reynolds,
with the aid of the GAO (the General Accounting Office), has studied
outsourcing of American jobs extensively.  "We cannot expect to remain
competitive on the world stage with the current level of cash outlay,"
Reynolds noted.

     Mr. Bush was informed by email this morning of his termination.

     Preparations for the job move have been underway for some time. Sanji
Gurvinder Singh of Indus Teleservices, Mumbai, India will be assuming the
Office of President of the United States as of July 1.  Mr. Singh was born
in the United States while his parents were vacationing at Niagara Falls,
thus making him eligible for the position.  He will receive a salary of $320
(USD) a month but with no health coverage or other benefits.  It is believed
that Mr. Singh will be able to handle his job responsibilities without
support staff. Due to the time difference between the US and India, he will
be working primarily at night, when  few offices of the US Government will
be open.

     "Working nights will allow me to keep my day job at the American
Express call center," stated Mr. Singh in an exclusive interview. "I am
excited about this position.  I always hoped I would be President someday."


     A Congressional Spokesperson noted that while Mr. Singh may not be
fully aware of all the issues involved in the office of President, this
should not be a problem.  Mr. Singh will rely upon a script tree that will
enable him to respond effectively to most topics of concern.  Using this
tree, he can address common concerns without having to understand the
underlying issues at all.

    "We know these scripting tools work," stated the Spokesperson.  "Mr.
Bush has used them successfully for years."

     Mr. Bush will receive health coverage, expenses, and salary until his
final day of employment.  Following a two week waiting period, he will be
eligible fo r $240 dollars a week unemployment for 13 weeks.  Unfortunately
he will not be eligible for Medicaid as his unemployment benefits will
exceed the allowed limit.

      Mr. Bush has been provided the outplacement services of Manpower,
Inc. to help him write a resume and prepare for his upcoming job transition.
According to Manpower, Mr. Bush may have difficulties in securing a new
position due to limited practical work experience.  One possibility is
re-enlistment in the Army National Guard.  Should he choose this option, he
would likely be stationed in Iraq, a country he has visited.  "I've been
there, I know all about Iraq," stated Mr. Bush, who gained invaluable
knowledge of the country in a visit to the Baghdad Airport nonsmoking
terminal and gift shop.  Sources in Baghdad and Falluja say Mr. Bush would
receive a warm reception from local Iraquis.  They have asked to be provided
with details of his arrival so that they might arrange an appropriate
welcome.
