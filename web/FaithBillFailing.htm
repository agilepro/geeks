<b>DESPITE WHITE HOUSE PRESSURE, COMPROMISE FAITH BILL IN TROUBLE?</b><br>
-- American Atheist News
<p>
 "Time Is Slipping Away," Whines Lieberman As Groups Blast Discrimination Loophole
<p>
A bipartisan compromise bill to enact part of President Bush's<br>
faith-based initiative is once again in trouble on Capitol Hill.
<p>
Opponents in the House and Senate have joined with gay civil rights<br>
groups in what the Boston Globe is describing as "an aggressive<br>
lobbying campaign" to block the legislation, and possibly de-rail a<br>
vote prior to the October 4 congressional recess deadline.
<p>
The compromise bill, S.  1924 is known as CARE or the "Charity Aid,<br>
Empowerment and Recovery Act."  Cobbled together by Sens.  Joseph<br>
Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Rick Santorum (R-PA.), the measure calls for<br>
tax incentives to encourage giving to religious organizations<br>
operating faith-based social programs.  Parts of the bill also provide<br>
money for training and legal support for those groups wishing to apply<br>
for federal grant money, and a $2 billion social services fund to be<br>
distributed by states and other agencies.
<p>
Proponents claim that the measure skirts many of the contentious legal<br>
issues that were part of earlier efforts to fund the faith-based<br>
initiative.  The House of Representatives has already passed HR 7, the<br>
"Community Solutions Act" that expanded the charitable choice<br>
provision of the 1996 welfare reform act.  The measure permits<br>
churches, mosques and temples to compete for government money in order<br>
to administer social welfare programs.  It also allows those groups to<br>
retain their "religious character" and ignore many of the First<br>
Amendment-related controls that existed previously.
<p>
Critics say that HR 7 and even CARE give wide latitude to religious<br>
service providers, and would, in effect, permit them to use public<br>
money for promoting religion.  American Atheists has opposed the<br>
faith-based initiative from its inception, charging that under the<br>
guise of combating poverty and other social ills, it imposes a<br>
"Religion Tax" on American citizens.
<p>
The CARE measure was adopted as a compromise on the initiative.  The<br>
White House is already trying to tap additional public funding<br>
sources, though, and recently ordered major federal agencies such as<br>
Housing and Human Services to re-write their regulations to include<br>
more faith-based programs.
<p>
At stake are billions of dollars in potential grants and other forms<br>
of financial aid to houses of worship.
<p>
With the Senate under enormous pressure from the White House to pass<br>
CARE in time for the upcoming election recess, the new civil rights<br>
coalition led by Rep.  Barney Frank, Massachusetts Democrat, wants to<br>
amend the measure and require religious groups accepting public money<br>
to obey civil rights laws and other anti-discrimination statutes.
<p>
That could upset the delicate balance of liberals and especially<br>
conservatives who fear that such a mandate would compromise religious<br>
freedom and offend some faith-based service providers.  If successful,<br>
the measure would mean that a church, for instance, could not<br>
discriminate in hiring practices on the basis of religious doctrine.
<p>
Since the Roosevelt Era and the New Deal, federal public aid programs<br>
have explicitly banned any such discrimination.  The Bush initiative,<br>
though, breaks with that policy and gives faith-based providers<br>
greater leeway in employment and other policies.
<p>
Frank and others "fear that discrimination will take place as a result<br>
of tenets of faith or cultural practices," notes Globe reporter Mary<br>
Leonard.
<p>
"It will lead to racism," Rep.  Frank warned.  He added that religious<br>
groups would only hire those who reflect their own teachings and that<br>
"Christian fundamentalists won't hire gays or lesbians."
<p>
Joining with Frank are the Human Rights Campaign and the Lambda Legal<br>
Defense Fund.  HRC says that while it "recognizes and supports the<br>
critical role performed by the many faith-and-community-based<br>
organizations," it seeks to amend S.  1924 with language prohibiting<br>
any group receiving tax dollars under the program from discriminating<br>
against gay Americans.
<p>
<b>A Monkey Wrench In The Works?</b>
<p>
Lieberman and Santorum are reportedly "frustrated and disappointed"<br>
that once again the faith-based initiative is stalling on Capitol Hill.
<p>
"Most senators would agree that getting help to charitable<br>
organizations in times of economic distress and war is a good thing to<br>
do," Santorum told reporters -- all the while ducking the<br>
constitutional problems of providing public money to religious groups.<br>
Santorum added that he and Lieberman had intentionally avoided any<br>
prohibition on discriminatory policies by faith groups in hopes of<br>
avoiding "the hot button issue" that has characterized the history of the<br>
legislation.
<p>
He also failed in a cloak room maneuver to persuade Senate Democrats<br>
to agree to a vote on CARE with a strict limit on amendments and time<br>
for debate.
<p>
Sen.  Lieberman is reportedly even furious about the latest pit-fall<br>
for his pet compromise.
<p>
"Time is slipping away," he told the Globe.  "This is a good bill, and<br>
it's one of the best things we could do for our communities this year.<br>
But, for reasons that are sometimes clear and sometimes not so clear,<br>
some of our colleagues are holding up action."
<p>
Sen.Jack Reed (D-RI) is working with Frank and the coalition to draft<br>
an amendment to CARE that would bar both discrimination in hiring and<br>
other practices by groups operating faith-based social programs, as<br>
well as outright proselytizing.  That would erode support for the<br>
initiative, though, from many conservatives and evangelical groups<br>
that insist they cannot participate in programs that affect the<br>
application of their dogmas to employment guidelines.<br>
