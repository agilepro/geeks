<b>Bill Moyers on Election 2002</b><p>

Way back in the 1950's when I first tasted politics and journalism,<br>
Republicans briefly controlled the White House and Congress. With the<br>
exception of Joseph McCarthy and his vicious ilk, they were a reasonable<br>
lot, presided over by that giant war hero, Dwight Eisenhower, who was<br>
conservative by temperament and moderate in the use of power.<p>

That brand of Republican is gone. And for the first time in the memory<br>
of anyone alive, the entire federal government - the Congress, the<br>
Executive, the Judiciary - is united behind a right-wing agenda for<br>
which George W. Bush believes he now has a mandate.<p>

That mandate includes the power of the state to force pregnant women to<br>
give up control over their own lives.<p>

It includes using the taxing power to transfer wealth from working<br>
people to the rich.<p>

It includes giving corporations a free hand to eviscerate the<br>
environment and control the regulatory agencies meant to hold them<br>
accountable.<p>

And it includes secrecy on a scale you cannot imagine. Above all, it<br>
means judges with a political agenda appointed for life. If you liked<br>
the Supreme Court that put George W. Bush in the White House, you will<br>
swoon over what's coming.<p>

And if you like God in government, get ready for the Rapture. These<br>
folks don't even mind you referring to the GOP as the party of God. Why<br>
else would the new House Majority Leader say that the Almighty is using<br>
him to promote 'a Biblical worldview' in American politics?<p>

So it is a heady time in Washington - a heady time for piety, profits,<br>
and military power, all joined at the hip by ideology and money.<p>

Don't forget the money. It came pouring into this election, to both<br>
parties, from corporate America and others who expect the payback.<br>
Republicans outraised democrats by $184 million dollars. And came up<br>
with the big prize - monopoly control of the American government, and<br>
the power of the state to turn their ideology into the law of the land.<br>
Quite a bargain at any price.<p>

That's it for this week.<p>

For NOW, I'm Bill Moyers.
