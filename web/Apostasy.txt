Islam, Christianity, Apostasy and Morality
-------------------------------------------

There are probably many Christians who are feeling morally superior to the Muslims who demanded death for the Afghani who converted to Christianity.  While it certainly is good to allow people freedom of religion, Christians should realize that the Bible is against it.  There are verses in Leviticus, Exodus, Deuteronomy, and Zechariah that mandate the death penalty for blasphemers, witches, false prophets, and anyone who attempts to entice a believer to worship another god.  By rejecting such biblical mandates, Christians are using human-centered morality instead of God-centered.

Christians should also know that there's no reliable historical record of Jesus ever actually existing.  The evidence is strong that Jesus is a mythical creation of writers in the second century and latter part of the first century.

Some Christians say that Jesus brought a new morality.  However, Jesus is quoted as supposedly saying that Scripture (what is now the Old Testament) is to be followed.

Christians also face an even more pressing problem; there's not a single reliable historical record of Jesus ever actually existing.  The evidence is strong that Jesus Christ is purely a mythical creation of writers in the second century and latter part of the first century.
