<p>"Long long ago, in a laboratory far far away, scientists
figured out that chimpanzees have 24 chromosomes in
their sperms and eggs, whereas humans only have 23.&nbsp;
Therefore, these great scientists theorized that two of
our chromosomes might have fused together sometime in
the recent past (aka millions of years ago).
<h3>Their theory made 3 predictions:</h3>
(1) One of our chromosomes would look like two of the
chimp chromosomes stuck together.<br>
(2) This same chromosome would have an extra sequence in
it that looked like a centromere.&nbsp; Centromeres are the
things in the middle that microtubules grab onto to
divide a pair of chromosomes during mitosis.<br>
(3) It would also have telomeres (ends) but in the middle
- and they would be in reverse order.&nbsp; Sort of like this:<br>
ENDchromosomestuffDNEENDchromosomestuffDNE
<br>See the "DNEEND" in the middle?&nbsp; That's what two
telomeres would look like if two chromosomes were stuck
together.<p>
As you might have guessed, all three predictions have been
verified.&nbsp; While, as always, it's impossible to prove that an
all-powerful being didn't create the evidence to trick us,
the reasonable explanation is that humans and chimps share a
common ancestor.<p>
