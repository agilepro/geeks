<b>Jeremiah 10:2-8</b><br>
Thus saith the Lord, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen
are dismayed at them. For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of
the hands of the workman, with the axe. They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with
hammers, that it move not.... They are altogether brutish and foolish.<p><br>
