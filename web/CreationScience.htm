The Theory of Evolution, Historical Evidence for Jesus</b></font></div>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Just because people
call themselves "creation scientists" does not make them scientists.&nbsp; "Creation
science" is not science because it
completely lacks what real science needs — empirical evidence.&nbsp; "Creation
science" and its latest incarnation,
intelligent design, make no verifiable predictions, get no useful results, and are not falsifyable,
and thus cannot in any way be called science.&nbsp; That is why accredited public
schools don't teach "creation science" or intelligent design.<p>
The Theory of Evolution is supported by the evidence of millions of facts all pointing to
evolution.&nbsp; These facts range from the distribution of animals, plants and fossils,
to the protein sequences, genes, and morphological characteristics of plants and
animals.&nbsp; Many Christians, including
the late Pope John Paul II, believe the Theory of Evolution.&nbsp; Scientists and
others don't just believe the Theory of Evolution; they
conclude that it is true — based on evidence and logic.
<p>Even our own bodies
have extensive evidence of our evolutionary heritage.&nbsp; When we get goose bumps,
our bodies are trying to keep warm by raising
hairs that no longer help.&nbsp; The
ability to wiggle ears is of no use for us, but not for some distant ancestors.&nbsp; We also
have many useless, vestigial organs such as nipples
on males, the appendix and the tailbone, which is just a holdover from when our
primate ancestors actually had tails millions of years ago.
<p>Many people, including scientists, believe in a god.&nbsp; However,
among America's top scientists, who are members of the National Academy of
Sciences, we find that only 7% of them believe in a personal god.&nbsp; Albert
Einstein did not believe in a personal god.
<p>As Americans, we are
all free to believe or disbelieve in what we want.&nbsp; Those who believe in Jesus
should know that there is no reliable
historical evidence that Jesus ever existed.&nbsp; In fact, the Jesus story
has many similarities to other religions of the
time — especially Mithraism, a religion that started in Persia about 4000 years
ago.&nbsp; In the Mithraism story, Mithra was born of a virgin on the
winter solstice.&nbsp; Shepherds
witnessed his birth and gift-carrying Magi visited him.&nbsp; During his life,
Mithra performed many miracles, cured many illnesses,
and cast out devils.&nbsp; He celebrated
a Last Supper with his 12 disciples before his death, which was to atone for the
sins of man.&nbsp; On the spring equinox,
Mithra ascended to heaven to rejoin his father.&nbsp; Mithra will send sinners
to hell and the faithful to heaven.<p>
St. Paul (nee Saul) was from Tarsus, a center for Mithraism at the time.&nbsp; He wrote about 2/3 of what
became the New Testament, and many of his ideas about religion were incorporated into Christianity.<p>
