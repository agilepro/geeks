Hello Mr. Thompson,

It was indeed laudable that so many of the founding fathers were against slavery.  Unfortunately they still alowed it to remain legal, and many kept slaves.  True, Washington freed the slaves on his death - but that doesn't show much of a strong moral commitment.

More to the point, was the philosophical basis for slavery that many found in the Christian Bible.  As I wrote in a previous email, not once in the entire Bible is slavery condemned, not even in the writings about Jesus.  In fact slavery is condoned in many places.  Even Jesus had recommendations about beating and killing slaves.  See Luke 12:42-48.  If your god or Jesus was such a great moralist, why didn't one of them tell of the evils of slavery?  Why didn't one of them say that women should have equal rights, or that children are not the property 
of their parents?

As I remember, you stated that the principle of all men being equal is a Christian concept.  It actually came from the philosophical movement called the Enlightenment, of the 17th and 18th centuries.  Christianity taught that slavery was accetible and that men were to obey their governments.  In fact, if our founders had followed Christian beliefs we would still be part of England.  Christian principles did not give rise to the USA, principles of the Enlightenment did.  Our nation was founded as the first country that derived its power from a purely secular, nonreligious basis. All nations before then had kings and queens who used their supposed "god-given divine right" to rule. Instead of this top-down power structure, our founders wisely created a government which derived its powers from the consent of the governed. They also realized the inherent divisiveness of religion, and kept it specifically out of our Constitution and government. The Treaty of Tripoli, signed by President John Adams and unanimously approved by the Senate in 1797, stated "The Government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion."

In answer to your questions about my "efforts to discredit God, remove prayer from the schools, and generally destroy religious faith," I ask you: What would you do if you saw that most people were following superstitions that stunted their minds, their relationships, their understanding of the universe, and their happiness?  For, this is what I see.

You say that no one can prove or disprove the existence of God.  This is wrong.  Depending on how we define this god, it is possible to prove that it doesn’t exist, just like it is possible to prove that square circles don’t exist.  The Christian god is typically defined as having free will, and being all-knowing, all-powerful, all-good and eternal.  ‘Free will’ means that God can make choices.

This sounds pretty good.  I know that I would certainly like to have all these attributes.  Unfortunately they are mutually exclusive and can’t all exist in one being, no matter how supernatural it is.  God can’t have free will and be all-knowing.  If God knows the future, God would be unable to change it, and thus could not have free will.  God also can’t be both all-good and all-powerful, because terrible events really do occur, and this all-loving god hasn’t prevented them.

The ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus summed it up well when he wrote these ideas:
     Either God wants to abolish evil, and cannot; or he can and does not want to.
     If he wants to, but cannot, he is impotent.
     If he can, but does not want to, he is wicked.
     If, as they say, God can abolish evil, and God really wants to do it, why is there evil in the world?

How about morality?  Some people say that we need an absolute morality, and that we all have a sense of morality.  They say that the only possible source for morality is God.  These concepts quickly collapse when we look at history, different cultures and religions, and the written sources of God’s supposed words on morality.  

Different groups within the main faiths often have different positions on such moral issues as the death penalty, abortion, and women’s rights.  How can this be, if they each get the same words from God?  Racism, misogyny, and slavery were all considered perfectly moral by a large portion of mankind and were seen as having a religious basis.  The slaughters and tortures done in the name of God, by most religions, are legendary.  Our culture has changed, along with our laws, and these evils are no longer acceptable in modern society.

The Christian Bible is touted by many as a source of ultimate knowledge and morality.  It is said to be God’s words to mankind.  Have you ever read it?  Some of it appears to have been written under the influence of hallucinogens.  It also contains the supposed histories of many rapes, slaughters, and other mass killings, most of them apparently condoned by God.  In some of the history in the Bible, the Hebrew soldiers kill large numbers of the enemy – including women and children.  They even note how the pregnant women were sliced open – so much for God being against abortion.  In one story, God kills almost everyone and everything on the planet because he doesn’t like the activities of some of the people in his creation.  How can that be the action of a loving god?  God seems to be more of a schizophrenic mass murderer than a paragon of moral virtue, and Satan comes off as the 
good guy.  After all, how many people did Satan kill? 

One of the primary moral points of Christianity is that Jesus died for our sins.  This is formally known as substitutive sacrifice.  It was practiced by the Jews, when they burned sacrificial animals on the altar.  What kind of morality is this?  When we look at other ancient cultures sacrificing animals or humans, we call it barbaric.  It makes no difference if the person being sacrificed agrees; it is still blatantly immoral. 

This subject is not merely a philosophical exercise; it has pertinent applications to the world in which we live.  Concurrent with the rise of the superstitions of religion in the U.S., the youth of America are scoring lower on scholastic tests.  We are the only major industrialized nation that has such a high degree of religious 
fundamentalism, and it’s causing a dumbing-down in our schools.

The bad news is that there is no god to watch over us.  The good news is that there is no hell, and we can all love and care for each other – if we so choose.

I am again including a longer write-up on this, prepared as a speech for a debate on the existence of God.

Sincerely,
Mark Thomas

Mr Thomas,

    I don't know if you are intellectually dishonest, or simply uninformed.

    St Paul said that in Jesus Christ, all are one, slave, free, gentile,
Jew.  Surely, it is disgraceful that it took so long for the world,
including Christians, to fully implement this principle. But it finally did
come, and it was a Christian idea. There are other Christian ideas that have
not yet been fully implemented but hopefully will be some day.

"True, Washington freed the slaves on his death - but that doesn't  show
much of a strong moral commitment." Sure it does. It was worth SOMETHING,
wasn't it?

    It is indisputable that the Founding fathers wrote and stated their
belief that Christianity was the foundation of American law, government, and
society.

Christiana principles)


  "The Government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the
Christian religion.". But he said that were were a christian nation.

" In answer to your questions about my "efforts to discredit God, remove

ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE STUNTED BY RELIGION. CAN YOU HONESTLY SAY
THAT PEOPLE WHO PRAY AND GO TO CHURCH AND TRY TO FOLLOW CHRISTIAN MORALITY
AND CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLES ARE WORSE OFF THAN THOSE WHO DO NOT? I SEE
SOMETHING DIFFERENT. I SEE CHRISTIANITY AS THE CATYLUST THAT OPENS UP THE
GREATEST POSSIBILITIES FOR HUMAN EBINGS IN LIVING THE MOST FULFILLING KIND
OF LIFE.

 You say that no one can prove or disprove the existence of God.  This is
 wrong.  Depending on how we define this god, it is possible to prove that
it
 doesn't exist, just like it is possible to prove that square circles don't
 exist.   The Christian god is typically defined as having free will, and
 being all-knowing, all-powerful, all-good and eternal.  'Free will' means
 that God can make choices.  This sounds pretty good.  I know that I would
certainly like to have all

 exist in one being, no matter how supernatural it is.  God can't have free
 will and be all-knowing.  If God knows the future, God would be unable to
 change it, and thus could not have free will.  God also can't be both
 all-good and all-powerful, because terrible events really do occur, and
this
 all-loving god hasn't prevented them.

THESE ARGUMENTS ARE SIMILIAR TO THE VIEW THAT GOD CANNOT MAKE A WEIGHT SO
HEAVY THAT HE CANNOT LIFT IT.  SILLINESS. NONE OF THIS PROOVES THAT GOD DOES
NOT EXIST. IT MAY INDICATE THAT WE HAVE DEFINED GOD WRONGLY.

YOU DEFINE GOD IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOU CAN DISMISS HIM. THAT IS FOOLISH.

 The ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus summed it up well when he wrote
these
 ideas:
     Either God wants to abolish evil, and cannot; or he can and does not
 want to.
      If he wants to, but cannot, he is impotent.
      If he can, but does not want to, he is wicked.
      If, as they say, God can abolish evil, and God really wants to do it,
 why is there evil in the world?

THE REASON FOR MUCH EVIL LIES IN THE FACT THAT GOD HAS GIVEN US THE RIGHT TO
SIN, FREE CHOICE. I RECOMMEND 'THE WILL OF GOD' BY LESLIE WEATHERHEAD.

THE FACT THAT CHURCHES HAVE SOMETIMES GOEN ASTRAY DOES NOT INVALIDATE THE

THE BIBLE IS THE RECORD OF MAN'S PERCEPTION OF GOD'S ACTION IN THE WORLD.
THE PERCEPTION IS NOT ALWAYS CORRECT, BUT GRADUALLY IMPROVES THROUGH THE
CENTURIES.

YOU HAVE CHOSEN A THEORY OF THE ATONEMENT THAT YOU CAN REBUT. THERE ARE
OTHER CHRISTIAN INTERPRETATIONS, SUCH AS THE MORAL INFLUENCE THEORY.  THERE
IS AN ELEMENT OF SACRIFICE IN THE ATONEMENT.  WOULD YOU CRITIZIZE A SOLDIER
WHO GAVE HIS LIFE FOR HIS COUNTRY? YOU TEND TO FIND THE WORST
INTERPRETATION, AND YOU LOOK FOR CHRISTIANITY AT ITS WORST. WHY NOT DO
BATTLE WITH CHRISTIANITY AT ITS BEST?

THIS ARGUMENT HAS NO BASIS IN ANY KIND OF RESEARCH. IT IS UNFOUNDED.

AGAIN, YOU ARE COMBATING A SIMPLISTIC VIEW OF GOD'S PROVIDENCE. WHAT ABOUT A
VIEW THAT THERE IS A POWER FROM GOD WHICH EMPOWER US BUT DOES NOT
MICROMANAGE OUR LIVES?

YOU CHOOSE EASY TARGETS. PICK SOME BETTER EXAMPLES. DO BATTLE WITH THE
BEST..

I SURMISE THAT YOU HAVE NOW DEFINED YOUR LIFE AS A CRITIC OF CHRISTIANITY,
POSSIBLY BECAUSE GOD OR THE CHURCH HAS DISAPPOINTED YOU..  THIS IS NOW YOUR
IDENTITY, AND YOU HAVE A GREAT INVESTMENT IN DEFENDING YOUR POSITION. YOU
WILL EVENTUALLY SEE THIS AS A POOR WAY TO DEFINE YOURSELF, AND AN
UNPRODUCTIVE WAY TO LIVE.

DO SOMETHING TO LIFT PEOPLE UP.


Arthur Thompson

=======================



Mr. Thompson,

OK, define your god, and how he/she/it is different from all the other gods that you (probably) don't believe in.  What can he do or not do? Does your god have free will, and is he all-knowing, all-powerful, all-good and eternal?  What evidence would you accept to show that this god does not exist?  At exactly what level does this god control us and the world?  If you were sick, would you pray to your god, or go to a doctor to get healed?  How different would our world look if this god did not exist?  Has this god changed from the god of the Old Testament?

Which moral teachings of Jesus and the bible do you agree with?  Which do you disagree with?  If you disagree with any, this will put you as a higher moral authority than the bible.

Does it trouble you that your god is as provable as Zeus, Thor, and so many of the other gods of religions past and present?

On Sept. 11, 2001, if you could have stopped the planes from crashing into the buildings, would you have done it?  If you say yes, then you are more moral than your all-powerful, omnipotent god.  The problem of evil, as explained so well by Epicurus, has never really been answered well by any religious philosopher.  Usually it is answered by such cop-outs as "it's a mystery," or "people have free will."  If you say that  your god can't stop personal actions, then your god is not all-powerful.

The writings of Paul are interesting, but what relevance should they have to CHRISTianity?  Did he speak out against slavery?  This statement looks more like it was designed to make slaves feel more comfortable with their slavery (they will get their reward in heaven, so their lives as slaves don't matter).  This one statement of Paul's also does not make up for the rest of the bible supporting slavery.  Paul never met Jesus, other than a 'vision' that he had, that was likely an epileptic fit or hallucination.  Much of Paul's ideas of what religion should be probably grew out of Judaism and Mithraism.  In fact, do a little research into Mithraism to see the similarities between it and Christianity.

You said, "It is indisputable that the Founding fathers wrote and stated their belief that Christianity was the foundation of American law, government, and society."  It's strange that they forgot to put it in the basis of our government - the Constitution.

The Enlightenment was not derived from Christian principles, it was fought by the Christian heirachy and the Christian-supported governments.  The Enlightenment was seen as an escape from the superstitions and crimes of Christianity.

If Washington had been really committed to freedom of slaves, he would have freed them in his lifetime.  It's much easier to have things done after your death, when you don't have to deal with the real-world results.

As for superstitions of religion in the U.S. and lower scholastic scores, about half of Americans don't believe in the well-established facts of evolution - mainly because of religious lies about it.  How can we teach our young to have rational thoughts when they are being bombarded by such intellectual drivel?  Christianity has historically strongly resisted advances in morality, science, medicine, types of government, and philosophy.

I strongly resent the implications of what you seem to think I will feel or think in the future, and what I think now.  The truth is that I simplely decided to stop believing in superstitions like religions, for which there is no empirical evidence.

Our group exists mainly to help the people who are recovering from the damages that religion has done to them, and to promote rational thought in our society.

It is up to each of us to determine reality and truth.

Sincerely,
Mark Thomas

============================


> Mr. Thompson,

IN GENERAL TERMS, I DEFINE MY GOD AS SOMEONE WHO WANTS THE BEST FOR HUMAN
BEINGS AND HAS PROVIDED THE BEST POSSIBLE WORLD, CONSISTENT WITH FREE WILL
AND CHOICE FOR US. I CANNOT DEFINE GOD COMPLETELY,  BECAUSE HE IS TOO LARGE,
AND HIS SCOPE IS BEYOND MY TOTAL COMPREHENSION.

 What can he do or not do?

HE CAN DO ANYTHING, BUT HE LIMITS HIMSELF TO HONOR OUR FREEDOM. I DO NOT
KNOW WHY HE SOMETIMES ACTS OR FAILS TO ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH MY DESIRES.
BUT I TRUST THAT HE DOES THE BEST THAT HE CAN IN GIVEN CIRCUMSTANCES.

 Does your > god have free will, and is he all-knowing, all-powerful,
all-good and  eternal?  What evidence would you accept to show that this god
does not  exist?  At exactly what level does this god control us and the
world?

GOD EXERTS AN INFLUENCE, BUT DOES NOT ROUTINELY OVERTURN THE LAWS OF NATURE.
BUT HE CAN, AND WILL AT TIMES.

 If > you were sick, would you pray to your god, or go to a doctor to get
healed?

YOU KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT. I WOULD DO BOTH, AND GOD WOULD WANT US TO DO
THAT. THERE IS PLENTY OF EVIDENCE THAT RELIGION HELPS THE HEALING PROCESS.

 How different would our world look if this god did not exist?

THE WORLD WOULD REVERT TO SOMETHING LIKE THE STONE AGE.

  Has this god  changed from the god of the Old Testament?

OUR PERCEPTIONS OF GOD HAVE CHANGED. GOD HAS NOT CHANGED.
>
 Which moral teachings of Jesus and the bible do you agree with?  Which do
 you disagree with?

I TRY TO FIND SOMETHING HELPFUL WITH ALL OF THE TEACHINGS OF JESUS AND THE
BIBLE.

If you disagree with any, this will put you as a higher  moral authority
than the bible

I AM A FREE MORAL AGENT AND I ASSUME  RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY ACTIONS. I MUST
INTERPRET THE BIBLE, AND SO DOES EVERYONE ELSE.

> Does it trouble you that your god is as provable as Zeus, Thor, and so

I HAVE EXPERIENCED GOD IN MY LIFE. I HAVE NO NEED TO JUDGE OTHER RELIGIONS.

I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THE MIND OF GOD AND KNOW WHAST HE KNOWS TO ANSWER THE
QUESTION ABOUT 9/11.  TRUST GOD TO DO WHAT HE THINKS IS BEST.

I ACCEPT THE POSITIVE INFLUENCE OF MY LIFE. I DO NOT KNOW WHY HE DOES NOT
BEHAVE THE WAY THAT I THINK I MIGHT BEHAVE.

 If you say that  your god can't stop  personal actions, then your god is
not all-powerful.

HE IS, BUT SOMETIMES HE CHOOSES TO ACT DIFFERENTLY THAN WE THINK WE WOULD.


YOU ASK ALL OF THESE LEADING QUESTIONS IN ORDER TO SET ME UP FOR YOUR
REBUTALS. GO AHEAD, I DON'T MIND.
>
> The writings of Paul are interesting, but what relevance should they have
to CHRISTianity?

EVERY RELEVANCE. PAUL IS REGARDED AS AN ABLE SPOKESMAN FOR CHRISTIANITY.

 Did he speak out against slavery?

PAUL SAID MANY THINGS WHICH APPLY TO THE SUBJECT OF TREATING OTHERS DECENTLY
AND EQUALLY. HE TREATED PEOPLE DECENTLY, REGARDLESS OF THEIR STATUS, SEX, OR
POSITION.

 This statement looks more  like it was designed to make slaves feel more
comfortable with their slavery
 (they will get their reward in heaven, so their lives as slaves don't
matter).

THIS IS THE STANDARD CRITICISM OF CHRISTIANITY...PIE IN THE SKY BY AND BY.
MY RELIGION IS IN THE HERE AND NOW. BUT I, LIKE PAUL, ASPIRE TO CERTAIN
IDEALS NOT YET POSSIBLE IN OUR SOCIAL CONTEXT.

  This one statement of Paul's also does not make up for the rest of
 the bible supporting slavery.  Paul never met Jesus, other than a 'vision'
 that he had, that was likely an epileptic fit or hallucination.  Much of
 Paul's ideas of what religion should be probably grew out of Judaism and
 Mithraism.
 In fact, do a little research into Mithraism to see the
 similarities between it and Christianity.

ALL RELIGIONS HAVE SOME THINGS IN COMMON. I DO NOT INDULGE IN CRITICIZING
OTHER RELIGIONS. BUT CHRISTIANITY HAS SPOKEN TO ME AND MEEDS MY NEEDS.

DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT THEY DID SAY THAT. MOST OF THEM DID SAY IT.

ITS TRUE THAT SOME CHRISTIANS HAVE DONE THAT. THE RELIGION THAT I KNOW DOES
NOT DO THAT. HOWEVER, EVOLUTION IS A THEORY NOT A FACT. I WOULD HAVE NO
OBJECTION TO TEACHING CREATIONISM AS WELL AS EVOLUTION AS COMPETING
THEORIES.


 I strongly resent the implications of what you seem to think I will feel or
 think in the future, and what I think now.  The truth is that I simplely
 decided to stop believing in superstitions like religions, for which there
 is no empirical evidence.

ARE YOU HAPPIER BECAUSE YOU HAVE DONE THAT/

AGAIN, I PREDICT THAT YOU WILL GET DONE WITH THAT, BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT TO
BE NOT VERY MUCH FUN. IT IS A SAD OCCUPATION. I AM HAVING MORE FUN THAN YOU
ARE. (NOT MAKING FUN OF YOU, NOT AT ALL). MORE FUN IN LIVING MY LIFE.

============================


If you have no problems with teaching both creationism and evolution in schools, then you are a prime example of the failures of our schools to teach science.

Your misunderstanding is probably based on a misunderstanding of "theory."

A scientific theory is a set of statements or principles devised to explain a group of facts or phenomena, especially one that has been repeatedly tested or is widely accepted and can be used to make predictions about natural phenomena.  We have the germ theory of disease, and the theory of gravity, to name two common examples.

There is overwhelming evidence for both the fact of evolution and the theory of evolution.  In the fossil record is the evidence that over 99% of all species that have ever existed are extinct; this is the fact of evolution.  The theory of evolution (which is in continual flux as we learn more) postulates the causes behind the changes in living things over time, which is often measured in millions and hundreds of millions of years.

The case for the theory of evolution rests on seven pillars:
 1) the fossil record (paleontology)
 2) comparative anatomy
 3) vestigial organs
 4) embryology
 5) distribution of animals
 6) natural selection
 7) sexual selection (e.g. peacocks)

There is no empiracal evidence for creationism.

If you have any doubts, I suggest that you visit any good museum of natural history.

It is rude to tell me what I think or will think, based especially on what YOU think.

As for any gods existing, we're just going to have to agree to disagree.  You see patterns that I don't think are there.

Sincerely,
Mark Thomas

===============

Hello Mr. Thompson,

I am almost 53, and have been some form of an atheist since I left home for college.  I realized that we're biologically almost the same as all other mammals, and subject to the same laws of biology.  All theistic religions  have no empirical evidence, just lots of wishes, myths, and unfounded bald statements.

It was only after I started doing more reading that I realized all the harm that religion has done and is still doing, Christianity especially.  It imprisons minds and causes people to accept as true some of the most
preposterous statements.  Christianity has been responsible for the tortured deaths of millions, and retarding the advancements of science and medicine.

Of course, Christian leaders can't face up to it and don't want this to be  known, so they continue to lie about it -- just like the Catholic Church has been lying about their problems with pedophiles.

Evolution is not a hypothesis, it is a set of statements and principles that explain the data.  Once again, you are a prime example of the failures of our schools to teach science.

I also noticed that you failed to answer some difficult questions that I asked.

Take care,
Mark Thomas
