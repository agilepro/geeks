God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything</a>.<p><br>
<h2 align=center>Religion Poisons Everything</h2>
There are four irreducible objections to religious faith: that
it wholly misrepresents the origins of man and
the cosmos, that because of this original error
it manages to combine the maximum of servility
with the maximum of solipsism, that it is both
the result and the cause of dangerous sexual
repression, and that it is ultimately grounded
on wish-thinking.
<p>I do not think it is
arrogant of me to claim that I had already
discovered these four objections (as well as
noticed the more vulgar and obvious fact that
religion is used by those in temporal charge to
invest themselves with authority) before my
boyish voice had broken. I am morally certain
that millions of other people came to very
similar conclusions in very much the same way,
and I have since met such people in hundreds of
places, and in dozens of different countries.
Many of them never believed, and many of them
abandoned faith after a difficult struggle. Some
of them had blinding moments of un-conviction
that were every bit as instantaneous, though
perhaps less epileptic and apocalyptic (and
later more rationally and more morally
justified) than Saul of Tarsus on the Damascene
road. And here is the point, about myself and my
co-thinkers. Our belief is not a belief. Our
principles are not a faith. We do not rely
solely upon science and reason, because these
are necessary rather than sufficient factors,
but we distrust anything that contradicts
science or outrages reason. We may differ on
many things, but what we respect is free
inquiry, openmindedness, and the pursuit of
ideas for their own sake. We do not hold our
convictions dogmatically: the disagreement
between Professor Stephen Jay Gould and
Professor Richard Dawkins, concerning
"punctuated evolution" and the unfilled gaps in
post-Darwinian theory, is quite wide as well as
quite deep, but we shall resolve it by evidence
and reasoning and not by mutual excommunication.
(My own annoyance at Professor Dawkins and
Daniel Dennett, for their cringe-making proposal
that atheists should conceitedly nominate
themselves to be called "brights," is a part of
a continuous argument.) We are not immune to the
lure of wonder and mystery and awe: we have
music and art and literature, and find that the
serious ethical dilemmas are better handled by
Shakespeare and Tolstoy and Schiller and
Dostoyevsky and George Eliot than in the
mythical morality tales of the holy books.
Literature, not scripture, sustains the mind
and—since there is no other metaphor—also the
soul. We do not believe in heaven or hell, yet
no statistic will ever find that without these
blandishments and threats we commit more crimes
of greed or violence than the faithful. (In
fact, if a proper statistical inquiry could ever
be made, I am sure the evidence would be the
other way.) We are reconciled to living only
once, except through our children, for whom we
are perfectly happy to notice that we must make
way, and room. We speculate that it is at least
possible that, once people accepted the fact of
their short and struggling lives, they might
behave better toward each other and not worse.
We believe with certainty that an ethical life
can be lived without religion. And we know for a
fact that the corollary holds true—that religion
has caused innumerable people not just to
conduct themselves no better than others, but to
award themselves permission to behave in ways
that would make a brothel-keeper or an ethnic
cleanser raise an eyebrow.
<p>Most important of
all, perhaps, we infidels do not need any
machinery of reinforcement. We are those who
Blaise Pascal took into account when he wrote to
the one who says, "I am so made that I cannot
believe."
<p>There is no need for us to
gather every day, or every seven days, or on any high
and auspicious day, to proclaim our rectitude or to
grovel and wallow in our unworthiness. We atheists do
not require any priests, or any hierarchy above them, to
police our doctrine. Sacrifices and ceremonies are
abhorrent to us, as are relics and the worship of any
images or objects (even including objects in the form of
one of man's most useful innovations: the bound book).
To us no spot on earth is or could be "holier" than
another: to the ostentatious absurdity of the
pilgrimage, or the plain horror of killing civilians in
the name of some sacred wall or cave or shrine or rock,
we can counterpose a leisurely or urgent walk from one
side of the library or the gallery to another, or to
lunch with an agreeable friend, in pursuit of truth or
beauty. Some of these excursions to the bookshelf or the
lunch or the gallery will obviously, if they are
serious, bring us into contact with belief and
believers, from the great devotional painters and
composers to the works of Augustine, Aquinas,
Maimonides, and Newman. These mighty scholars may have
written many evil things or many foolish things, and
been laughably ignorant of the germ theory of disease or
the place of the terrestrial globe in the solar system,
let alone the universe, and this is the plain reason why
there are no more of them today, and why there will be
no more of them tomorrow. Religion spoke its last
intelligible or noble or inspiring words a long time
ago: either that or it mutated into an admirable but
nebulous humanism, as did, say, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a
brave Lutheran pastor hanged by the Nazis for his
refusal to collude with them. We shall have no more
prophets or sages from the ancient quarter, which is why
the devotions of today are only the echoing repetitions
of yesterday, sometimes ratcheted up to screaming point
so as to ward off the terrible emptiness.
<p>While some religious apology
is magnificent in its limited way—one might cite
Pascal—and some of it is dreary and absurd—here one
cannot avoid naming C. S. Lewis—both styles have
something in common, namely the appalling load of strain
that they have to bear. How much effort it takes to
affirm the incredible! The Aztecs had to tear open a
human chest cavity <em>every day</em> just to make sure
that the sun would rise. Monotheists are supposed to
pester their deity more times than that, perhaps, lest
he be deaf. How much vanity must be concealed—not too
effectively at that—in order to pretend that one is the
personal object of a divine plan? How much self-respect
must be sacrificed in order that one may squirm
continually in an awareness of one's own sin? How many
needless assumptions must be made, and how much
contortion is required, to receive every new insight of
science and manipulate it so as to "fit" with the
revealed words of ancient man-made deities? How many
saints and miracles and councils and conclaves are
required in order first to be able to establish a dogma
and then—after infinite pain and loss and absurdity and
cruelty—to be forced to rescind one of those dogmas? God
did not create man in his own image. Evidently, it was
the other way about, which is the painless explanation
for the profusion of gods and religions, and the
fratricide both between and among faiths, that we see
all about us and that has so retarded the development of
civilization.
<p>The mildest criticism of religion is also the most radical and the most
devastating one. Religion is man-made. Even the men who
made it cannot agree on what their prophets or redeemers
or gurus actually said or did. Still less can they hope
to tell us the "meaning" of later discoveries and
developments which were, when they began, either
obstructed by their religions or denounced by them. And
yet—the believers still claim to know! Not just to know,
but to know everything. Not just to know that god
exists, and that he created and supervised the whole
enterprise, but also to know what "he" demands of
us—from our diet to our observances to our sexual
morality. In other words, in a vast and complicated
discussion where we know more and more about less and
less, yet can still hope for some enlightenment as we
proceed, one faction—itself composed of mutually warring
factions—has the sheer arrogance to tell us that we
already have all the essential information we need. Such
stupidity, combined with such pride, should be enough on
its own to exclude "belief" from the debate. The person
who is certain, and who claims divine warrant for his
certainty, belongs now to the infancy of our species. It
may be a long farewell, but it has begun and, like all
farewells, should not be protracted.
<p>The argument with faith is
the foundation and origin of all arguments, because it
is the beginning—but not the end—of all arguments about
philosophy, science, history, and human nature. It is
also the beginning—but by no means the end—of all
disputes about the good life and the just city.
Religious faith is, precisely <em>because</em> we are
still-evolving creatures, ineradicable. It will never
die out, or at least not until we get over our fear of
death, and of the dark, and of the unknown, and of each
other. For this reason, I would not prohibit it even if
I thought I could. Very generous of me, you may say. But
will the religious grant me the same indulgence? I ask
because there is a real and serious difference between
me and my religious friends, and the real and serious
friends are sufficiently honest to admit it. I would be
quite content to go to their children's bar mitzvahs, to
marvel at their Gothic cathedrals, to "respect" their
belief that the Koran was dictated, though exclusively
in Arabic, to an illiterate merchant, or to interest
myself in Wicca and Hindu and Jain consolations. And as
it happens, I will continue to do this without insisting
on the polite reciprocal condition—which is <em>that
they in turn leave me alone</em>. But this, religion is
ultimately incapable of doing. As I write these words,
and as you read them, people of faith are in their
different ways planning your and my destruction, and the
destruction of all the hard-won human attainments that I
have touched upon. <em>Religion poisons everything.</em><p><br>
<h2 align=center>Was Muhammad Epileptic?</h2>
There is some question as to whether
Islam is a separate religion at all. It initially fulfilled a need
among Arabs for a distinctive or special creed, and is forever
identified with their language and their impressive later conquests,
which, while not as striking as those of the young Alexander of
Macedonia, certainly conveyed an idea of being backed by a divine
will until they petered out at the fringes of the Balkans and the
Mediterranean. But Islam when examined is not much more than a
rather obvious and ill-arranged set of plagiarisms, helping itself
from earlier books and traditions as occasion appeared to require.
Thus, far from being "born in the clear light of history," as Ernest
Renan so generously phrased it, Islam in its origins is just as
shady and approximate as those from which it took its borrowings. It
makes immense claims for itself, invokes prostrate submission or
"surrender" as a maxim to its adherents, and demands deference and
respect from nonbelievers into the bargain. There is
nothing—absolutely nothing—in its teachings that can even begin to
justify such arrogance and presumption.
<p>The prophet died in the year 632 of our
own approximate calendar. The first account of his life was set down
a full hundred and twenty years later by Ibn Ishaq, whose original
was lost and can only be consulted through its reworked form,
authored by Ibn Hisham, who died in 834. Adding to this hearsay and
obscurity, there is no agreed-upon account of how the Prophet's
followers assembled the Koran, or of how his various sayings (some
of them written down by secretaries) became codified. And this
familiar problem is further complicated—even more than in the
Christian case—by the matter of succession. Unlike Jesus, who
apparently undertook to return to earth very soon and who (<em>pace</em>
the absurd Dan Brown) left no known descendants, Muhammad was a
general and a politician and—though unlike Alexander of Macedonia a
prolific father—left no instruction as to who was to take up his
mantle. Quarrels over the leadership began almost as soon as he
died, and so Islam had its first major schism—between the Sunni and
the Shia—before it had even established itself as a system. We need
take no side in the schism, except to point out that one at least of
the schools of interpretation must be quite mistaken. And the
initial identification of Islam with an earthly caliphate, made up
of disputatious contenders for the said mantle, marked it from the
very beginning as man-made.
<p>It is said by some Muslim authorities
that during the first caliphate of Abu Bakr, immediately after
Muhammad's death, concern arose that his orally transmitted words
might be forgotten. So many Muslim soldiers had been killed in
battle that the number who had the Koran safely lodged in their
memories had become alarmingly small. It was therefore decided to
assemble every living witness, together with "pieces of paper,
stones, palm leaves, shoulder-blades, ribs and bits of leather" on
which sayings had been scribbled, and give them to Zaid ibn Thabit,
one of the Prophet's former secretaries, for an authoritative
collation. Once this had been done, the believers had something like
an authorized version.<p>
If true, this would date the Koran to a
time fairly close to Muhammad's own life. But we swiftly discover
that there is no certainty or agreement about the truth of the
story. Some say that it was Ali—the fourth and not the first caliph,
and the founder of Shiism—who had the idea. Many others—the Sunni
majority—assert that it was Caliph Uthman, who reigned from 644 to
656, who made the finalized decision. Told by one of his generals
that soldiers from different provinces were fighting over discrepant
accounts of the Koran, Uthman ordered Zaid ibn Thabit to bring
together the various texts, unify them, and have them transcribed
into one. When this task was complete, Uthman ordered standard
copies to be sent to Kufa, Basra, Damascus, and elsewhere, with a
master copy retained in Medina. Uthman thus played the canonical
role that had been taken, in the standardization and purging and
censorship of the Christian Bible, by Irenaeus and by Bishop
Athanasius of Alexandria. The roll was called, and some texts were
declared sacred and inerrant while others became "apocryphal."
Outdoing Athanasius, Uthman ordered that all earlier and rival
editions be destroyed.
<p>Even supposing this version of events to
be correct, which would mean that no chance existed for scholars
ever to determine or even dispute what really happened in Muhammad's
time, Uthman's attempt to abolish disagreement was a vain one. The
written Arabic language has two features that make it difficult for
an outsider to learn: it uses dots to distinguish consonants like
"b" and "t," and in its original form it had no sign or symbol for
short vowels, which could be rendered by various dashes or
comma-type marks. Vastly different readings even of Uthman's version
were enabled by these variations. Arabic script itself was not
standardized until the later part of the ninth century, and in the
meantime the undotted and oddly voweled Koran was generating wildly
different explanations of itself, as it still does. This might not
matter in the case of the <em>Iliad</em>, but remember that we are
supposed to be talking about the unalterable (and <em>final</em>)
word of god. There is obviously a connection between the sheer
feebleness of this claim and the absolutely fanatical certainty with
which it is advanced. To take one instance that can hardly be called
negligible, the Arabic words written on the outside of the Dome of
the Rock in Jerusalem are different from any version that appears in
the Koran.
<p>The situation is even more shaky and
deplorable when we come to the hadith, or that vast orally generated
secondary literature which supposedly conveys the sayings and
actions of Muhammad, the tale of the Koran's compilation, and the
sayings of "the companions of the Prophet." Each hadith, in order to
be considered authentic, must be supported in turn by an <em>isnad</em>,
or chain, of supposedly reliable witnesses. Many Muslims allow their
attitude to everyday life to be determined by these anecdotes:
regarding dogs as unclean, for example, on the sole ground that
Muhammad is said to have done so.
<p>As one might expect, the six authorized
collections of hadith, which pile hearsay upon hearsay through the
unwinding of the long spool of isnads ("A told B, who had it from C,
who learned it from D"), were put together centuries after the
events they purport to describe. One of the most famous of the six
compilers, Bukhari, died 238 years after the death of Muhammad.
Bukhari is deemed unusually reliable and honest by Muslims, and
seems to have deserved his reputation in that, of the <em>three
hundred thousand</em> attestations he accumulated in a lifetime
devoted to the project, he ruled that <em>two hundred thousand </em>
of them were entirely valueless and unsupported. Further exclusion
of dubious traditions and questionable isnads reduced his grand
total to ten thousand hadith. You are free to believe, if you so
choose, that out of this formless mass of illiterate and
half-remembered witnessing the pious Bukhari, more than two
centuries later, managed to select only the pure and undefiled ones
that would bear examination.
<p>The likelihood that any of this humanly
derived rhetoric is "inerrant," let alone "final," is conclusively
disproved not just by its innumerable contradictions and
incoherencies but by the famous episode of the Koran's alleged
"satanic verses," out of which Salman Rushdie was later to make a
literary project. On this much-discussed occasion, Muhammad was
seeking to conciliate some leading Meccan poly-theists and in due
course experienced a "revelation" that allowed them after all to
continue worshipping some of the older local deities. It struck him
later that this could not be right and that he must have
inadvertently been "channeled" by the devil, who for some reason had
briefly chosen to relax his habit of combating monotheists on their
own ground. (Muhammad believed devoutly not just in the devil
himself but in minor desert devils, or <em>djinns</em>, as well.) It
was noticed even by some of his wives that the Prophet was capable
of having a "revelation" that happened to suit his short-term needs,
and he was sometimes teased about it. We are further told—on no
authority that need be believed—that when he experienced revelation
in public he would sometimes be gripped by pain and experience loud
ringing in his ears. Beads of sweat would burst out on him, even on
the chilliest of days. Some heartless Christian critics have
suggested that he was an epileptic (though they fail to notice the
same symptoms in the seizure experienced by Paul on the road to
Damascus), but there is no need for us to speculate in this way. It
is enough to rephrase David Hume's unavoidable question. Which is
more likely—that a man should be used as a transmitter by god to
deliver some already existing revelations, or that he should utter
some already existing revelations and believe himself to be, or
claim to be, ordered by god to do so? As for the pains and the
noises in the head, or the sweat, one can only regret the seeming
fact that direct communication with god is not an experience of
calm, beauty, and lucidity.<p><br>
<h2 align=center>Mormonism: A Racket Becomes a Religion</h2>
If the followers of the prophet Muhammad
hoped to put an end to any future "revelations" after the immaculate
conception of the Koran, they reckoned without the founder of what
is now one of the world's fastest-growing faiths. And they did not
foresee (how could they, mammals as they were?) that the prophet of
this ridiculous cult would model himself on theirs. The Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints—hereafter known as the Mormons—was
founded by a gifted opportunist who, despite couching his text in
openly plagiarized Christian terms, announced that "I shall be to
this generation a new Muhammad" and adopted as his fighting slogan
the words, which he thought he had learned from Islam, "Either the
Al-Koran or the sword." He was too ignorant to know that if you use
the word <em>al</em> you do not need another definite article, but
then he did resemble Muhammad in being able only to make a borrowing
out of other people's bibles.
<p>In March 1826 a court in Bainbridge, New
York, convicted a twenty-one-year-old man of being "a disorderly
person and an impostor." That ought to have been all we ever heard
of Joseph Smith, who at trial admitted to defrauding citizens by
organizing mad gold-digging expeditions and also to claiming to
possess dark or "necromantic" powers. However, within four years he
was back in the local newspapers (all of which one may still read)
as the discoverer of the "Book of Mormon." He had two huge local
advantages which most mountebanks and charlatans do not possess.
First, he was operating in the same hectically pious district that
gave us the Shakers and several other self-proclaimed American
prophets. So notorious did this local tendency become that the
region became known as the "Burned-Over District," in honor of the
way in which it had surrendered to one religious craze after
another. Second, he was operating in an area which, unlike large
tracts of the newly opening North America, did possess the signs of
an ancient history.
<p>A vanished and vanquished Indian
civilization had bequeathed a considerable number of burial mounds,
which when randomly and amateurishly desecrated were found to
contain not merely bones but also quite advanced artifacts of stone,
copper, and beaten silver. There were eight of these sites within
twelve miles of the underperforming farm which the Smith family
called home. There were two equally stupid schools or factions who
took a fascinated interest in such matters: the first were the
gold-diggers and treasure-diviners who brought their magic sticks
and crystals and stuffed toads to bear in the search for lucre, and
the second those who hoped to find the resting place of a lost tribe
of Israel. Smith's cleverness was to be a member of both groups, and
to unite cupidity with half-baked anthropology.
<p>The actual story of the imposture is
almost embarrassing to read, and almost embarrassingly easy to
uncover. (It has been best told by Dr. Fawn Brodie, whose 1945 book
<em>No Man Knows My History</em> was a good-faith attempt by a
professional historian to put the kindest possible interpretation on
the relevant "events.") In brief, Joseph Smith announced that he had
been visited (three times, as is customary) by an angel named
Moroni. The said angel informed him of a book, "written upon gold
plates," which explained the origins of those living on the North
American continent as well as the truths of the gospel. There were,
further, two magic stones, set in the twin breastplates Urim and
Thummim of the Old Testament, that would enable Smith himself to
translate the aforesaid book. After many wrestlings, he brought this
buried apparatus home with him on September 21, 1827, about eighteen
months after his conviction for fraud. He then set about producing a
translation.
<p>The resulting "books" turned out to be a
record set down by ancient prophets, beginning with Nephi, son of
Lephi, who had fled Jerusalem in approximately 600 BC and come to
America. Many battles, curses, and afflictions accompanied their
subsequent wanderings and those of their numerous progeny. How did
the books turn out to be this way? Smith refused to show the golden
plates to anybody, claiming that for other eyes to view them would
mean death. But he encountered a problem that will be familiar to
students of Islam. He was extremely glib and fluent as a debater and
story-weaver, as many accounts attest. But he was illiterate, at
least in the sense that while he could read a little, he could not
write. A scribe was therefore necessary to take his inspired
dictation. This scribe was at first his wife Emma and then, when
more hands were necessary, a luckless neighbor named Martin Harris.
Hearing Smith cite the words of Isaiah 29, verses 11–12, concerning
the repeated injunction to "Read," Harris mortgaged his farm to help
in the task and moved in with the Smiths. He sat on one side of a
blanket hung across the kitchen, and Smith sat on the other with his
translation stones, intoning through the blanket. As if to make this
an even happier scene, Harris was warned that if he tried to glimpse
the plates, or look at the prophet, he would be struck dead.
<p>Mrs. Harris was having none of this, and
was already furious with the fecklessness of her husband. She stole
the first hundred and sixteen pages and challenged Smith to
reproduce them, as presumably—given his power of revelation—he
could. (Determined women like this appear far too seldom in the
history of religion.) After a very bad few weeks, the ingenious
Smith countered with another revelation. He could not replicate the
original, which might be in the devil's hands by now and open to a
"satanic verses" interpretation. But the all-foreseeing Lord had
meanwhile furnished some smaller plates, indeed the very plates of
Nephi, which told a fairly similar tale. With infinite labor, the
translation was resumed, with new scriveners behind the blanket as
occasion demanded, and when it was completed all the original golden
plates were transported to heaven, where apparently they remain to
this day.
<p>Mormon partisans sometimes say, as do
Muslims, that this cannot have been fraudulent because the work of
deception would have been too much for one poor and illiterate man.
They have on their side two useful points: if Muhammad was ever
convicted in public of fraud and attempted necromancy we have no
record of the fact, and Arabic is a language that is somewhat opaque
even to the fairly fluent outsider. However, we know the Koran to be
made up in part of earlier books and stories, and in the case of
Smith it is likewise a simple if tedious task to discover that
twenty-five thousand words of the Book of Mormon are taken directly
from the Old Testament. These words can mainly be found in the
chapters of Isaiah available in Ethan Smith's <em>View of the
Hebrews</em>: <em>The Ten Tribes of Israel in America</em>. This
then popular work by a pious loony, claiming that the American
Indians originated in the Middle East, seems to have started the
other Smith on his gold-digging in the first place. A further two
thousand words of the Book of Mormon are taken from the New
Testament. Of the three hundred and fifty "names" in the book, more
than one hundred come straight from the Bible and a hundred more are
as near stolen as makes no difference. (The great Mark Twain
famously referred to it as "chloroform in print," but I accuse him
of hitting too soft a target, since the book does actually contain
"The Book of Ether.") The words "and it came to pass" can be found
at least two thousand times, which does admittedly have a soporific
effect. Quite recent scholarship has exposed every single other
Mormon "document" as at best a scrawny compromise and at worst a
pitiful fake, as Dr. Brodie was obliged to notice when she reissued
and updated her remarkable book in 1973.
<p>Like Muhammad, Smith could produce divine
revelations at short notice and often simply to suit himself
(especially, and like Muhammad, when he wanted a new girl and wished
to take her as another wife). As a result, he overreached himself
and came to a violent end, having meanwhile excommunicated almost
all the poor men who had been his first disciples and who had been
browbeaten into taking his dictation. Still, this story raises some
very absorbing questions, concerning what happens when a plain
racket turns into a serious religion before our eyes.
<p>It must be said for the "Latter-day
Saints" (these conceited words were added to Smith's original
"Church of Jesus Christ" in 1833) that they have squarely faced one
of the great difficulties of revealed religion. This is the problem
of what to do about those who were born before the exclusive
"revelation," or who died without ever having the opportunity to
share in its wonders. Christians used to resolve this problem by
saying that Jesus descended into hell after his crucifixion, where
it is thought that he saved or converted the dead. There is indeed a
fine passage in Dante's <em>Inferno</em> where he comes to rescue
the spirits of great men like Aristotle, who had presumably been
boiling away for centuries until he got around to them. (In another
less ecumenical scene from the same book, the Prophet Muhammad is
found being disemboweled in revolting detail.) The Mormons have
improved on this rather backdated solution with something very
literal-minded. They have assembled a gigantic genealogical database
at a huge repository in Utah, and are busy filling it with the names
of all people whose births, marriages, and deaths have been
tabulated since records began. This is very useful if you want to
look up your own family tree, and as long as you do not object to
having your ancestors becoming Mormons. Every week, at special
ceremonies in Mormon temples, the congregations meet and are given a
certain quota of names of the departed to "pray in" to their church.
This retrospective baptism of the dead seems harmless enough to me,
but the American Jewish Committee became incensed when it was
discovered that the Mormons had acquired the records of the Nazi
"final solution," and were industriously baptizing what for once
could truly be called a "lost tribe": the murdered Jews of Europe.
For all its touching inefficacy, this exercise seemed in poor taste.
I sympathize with the American Jewish Committee, but I nonetheless
think that the followers of Mr. Smith should be congratulated for
hitting upon even the most simpleminded technological solution to a
problem that has defied solution ever since man first invented religion.<p>
