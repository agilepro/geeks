<p>The lawyer, who recently praised the Mumbai terror attacks, urged
all Muslims to reject traditional Christmas celebrations, claiming
that they are forbidden by Allah.
<p>The 41-year-old shocked Christians and even those of his own
faith by branding yuletide festivities as "the pathway to hellfire".
<p>Choudary, who is chairman of the Society of Muslim Lawyers, ruled
out all celebrations, including having a Christmas tree, decorating
the house or eating turkey.
<p>In the sermon posted on an Islamic website, he said: "In the
world today many Muslims, especially those residing in western
countries, are exposed to the evil celebration Christmas.
<p>"Many take part in the festival celebrations by having Christmas
turkey dinners.
<p>"Decorating the house, purchasing Christmas trees or having
Christmas turkey meals are completely prohibited by Allah.
<p>"Many still practise this corrupt celebration as a remembrance of
the birth of Jesus.
<p>"How can a Muslim possibly approve or participate in such a
practice that bases itself on the notion Allah has an offspring?
<p>"The very concept of Christmas contradicts and conflicts with the
foundation of Islam.
<p>"Every Muslim has a responsibility to protect his family from the
misguidance of Christmas, because its observance will lead to
hellfire. Protect your Paradise from being taken away – protect
yourself and your family from Christmas."
<p>Choudary is Principal Lecturer at the London School of Shari'ah
and a follower of the Islamist militant leader Omar Bakri Mohammed.
<p>Earlier this year, he led a meeting at the heart of the area
where the liquid bombers lived, which warned of a British September 11.
