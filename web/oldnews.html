<p><hr><H3>Wednesday 2/28, 7:30 pm - Is there a connection between prayer and healing?<br>
- in Mtn. View</H3>
Dr. Wallace Sampson gave an informal talk followed by a discussion period on prayer and religion,
as it relates to the claims of the studies that have been done.&nbsp; This was a unique opportunity to
learn if prayer, therapeutic touch, and religion aids recovery.&nbsp; Dr. Sampson carefully examined
the published studies for flawed methods and the normal course of diseases or illnesses.&nbsp; Can prayer
result in the Fr. Serra [St. Sierra] effect?<p>
Dr. Sampson serves as editor of The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine and is a member of the
Board of Directors of the National Council Against Health Fraud.&nbsp; He has served as Chief of Medical
Oncology at the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, and is clinical Professor Emeritus of Medicine at

<p><H3>Wednesday, January 24, 7:30 pm - PBS video "The New Atheists"<br>
- in <a href=Directions.htm>Mtn. View.</a></H3>
The PBS program Religion and Ethics Newsweekly recently aired a special segment on Atheism and unbelief in America.<p>
The show's cameras were also on hand to capture the November 14 Grand Opening press conference of the
Center for Inquiry's new Office of Public Policy in Washington, D.C. In a wide-ranging interview, Paul Kurtz took
the opportunity to discuss the dangerous intermingling of religion with science and the ethics of leading
a good moral life, without the need for religion.<p>
From the Web site (http://www.pbs.org/religion):<p>
According to national polls, 90 percent of Americans say they believe in God, and more than 50 percent
hold a negative view of those who don’t share their belief in a "Supreme Being."  But non-religious fervor
is slowly gaining a foothold in the U.S. as some atheists find a way to successfully reach out to mainstream
America about their views on the existence of God.<p>
Betty Rollin explores how a small group of America’s non-believers, such as biologist Richard Dawkins,
author of "The God Delusion," neuroscientist Sam Harris, author of "Letter to a Christian Nation," and
actress/comedian Julia Sweeney, are challenging religious fundamentalism through best-selling works and
sold-out performances. According to Harris, "The usefulness of religion -- the fact that it gives meaning,
that it makes people feel good -- is not an argument for the truth of any religious doctrine."

Provocative videotaped interview with Daniel Dennet, author
of <i>Breaking the Spell</i>. If Dennet is not religious, why does he go to
church occasionally? How is religion like our sweet tooth? How can
taking the "faith card" off the table help improve thinking? And what
does that mean? How is what we are asking the Iraqis to do different
from what the US government is doing? Interviewer Bill Moyers finds
some of his questions turned on him!<p>
Daniel Dennett is a philosophy professor and co-director of the
Center for Cognitive Studies at Tufts University. He is the author of <i>Breaking the Spell,
Brainstorms, Elbow Room, Consciousness Explained</i> and <i>Darwin's Dangerous Idea</i>,

<p><hr><H2>Wednesday, Apr. 26, 7:30 pm — Marc Perkel,
on the <a href=http://www.churchofreality.org>Church of Reality</a></H2>
The <a href=http://www.churchofreality.org>Church of Reality</a> is a religion based on the practice of Realism,
believing in everything that is real. Our motto is, "If it's real, we believe in it." Since no one knows all of
reality, the Church of Reality is really a religious commitment to the pursuit of reality the way it really is.
We think about thinking. We wonder about wondering. We try to understand the understanding of understanding.<p>
Realism is the next stage in the evolution of Atheism - moving the focus from what we don't believe in to what we do
believe in. Learn why Realism moves the focus away from deities and on to what really is real.

<p><hr><H2>Wednesday, Apr. 12, 7:30 pm — Movie: "Devil's Playground" in Mtn. View</H2>
Amish youth, on turning 16, are turned loose to experience the outside world until they can decide whether or not
to commit to a lifetime within the Amish community. "Devil's Playground" follows four Amish teens through this
experience and is the first film to get inside the Amish community. With this freedom comes many conflicting emotions;
full-blown teenage mayhem coupled with deep religious roots — a brutal combination.

<p><hr><H2>Wednesday, Mar. 22, 7:30 pm — Video: "Religion as a Natural Phenomenon"<br>

Daniel Dennett analyzes the purpose of religion in his new
book, <i>Breaking the Spell</i>. The author describes religion as a cultural
phenomenon that was developed by natural, evolutionary processes. During his

Author Bio: Daniel Dennett is a philosophy professor and co-director of the

<i>Brainstorms, Elbow Room, Consciousness Explained</i> and <i>Darwin's
Dangerous Idea</i>, a finalist for the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize.

<p><hr><H2>Wednesday, Feb. 22, 7:30 pm — State/Church Separation Panel, at Stanford</H2>
Admission:<br>
<b>FREE</b><p>
Location:<br>
Building 370, Room 370<br>
Main Quad, 450 Serra Mall<br>
Stanford University<p>
Join the Stanford Rational Thought student group in support of their
panel of luminaries Eddie Tabash, Annie Laurie Gaylor, and Tim
Gordinier. Eddie Tabash is a well-known Atheist who has run for public
office with serious chances of winning. Annie Laurie Gaylor is co-
president of Freedom From Religion Foundation which regularly
challenges government infringement. Tim Gordinier is the Director of
Public Policy at the Institute for Humanist Studies.<p>
For several years now, the constitutional separation of politics and
religion has been under severe attack. Court cases about the public display
of the Ten Commandments spring to mind. Even more sweeping is the Bush
administration's financing of faith-based initiatives, and extremely
troubing is its support for prison programs with prominent religious
components. Come hear what these panelists have to say about "Whither
Church/State Separation?"<p>
Annie Laurie Gaylor is the co-founder of the Freedom From Religion
Foundation and the editor of the Foundation's journal Freethought Today.
She is also the author of "Woe to the Women: The Bible Tells Me So",
"Betrayal of Trust: Clergy Abuse of Children", and "Women Without
Superstition: No Gods - No Masters".<p>
Tim Gordinier is the Director of Public Policy and Education at the
Institute for Humanist Studies, where he spearheads the Institute's
legislative agenda. He has a doctorate in Political Science with a focus on
constitutional law and specifically on the religion clause of the First
Amendment.<p>
Eddie Tabash is a civil rights attorney and the Chair of the National Legal
Committee for Americans United for the Separation of Church and State. He
has been active in the abortion rights movement in California and has
successfully represented the secular humanist position in a number of high
profile debates, such as with William Lane Craig or Peter Van Inwagen.

— Audio Tape of Bishop John Shelby Spong</h3>
What does he have to say? Why do we care?<p>
We listened to Bishop John Shelby Spong’s speech to the Spiritual Activism
Conference - courtesy of our very own God-frey! This was not a bible thumper speech.<p>
The Reverend seemed to reject the god of myth and invent a new god.
Can the godless work with him and maybe even support his brand of religion?
He was at times serious, outright hilarious, and rebelliously controversial
for most church goers and even included Atheists in his speech.

<p><hr><H3>Wednesday, Nov. 23, 7:30 pm, in Mtn. View.<br>

<p><hr><H3>Wednesday, Oct. 26, 8:00 pm, at Stanford<br>
— Women and Humanism</H2>
This was sponsored by <a href=http://www.stanford.edu/group/ratt/>RATT, the Stanford Rational Thought Group</a>.<p>
Panelists:<br>
Masuma Ahmed (Humanist Voice from the East)<br>
Sena Havasy (Humanist Celebrant)<br>
Chris Lindstrom (Founder of the Garrison-Martineau Project)<br>
Molleen Matsumura (Author of the "Sweet Reason" Advice Column)<p>
Humanism is a life philosophy that intrinsically values
all human beings, irrespective of their gender, race,
sexual orientation, or social status. The gender inequalities
that are present in many religions simply have no place in
Humanism. Nevertheless, we all sometimes struggle to apply our
ideals to our daily lives. We heard about the contributions to
the non-believers' movements by outspoken secular women in the
past, why it is important to hear women's voices when tackling
today's issues, and how the four panelists use their humanistic
ideals to make the world a better place--for both women and men.<p>

<hr><H3>Wednesday, Sep. 28, 7:30 pm, in <a href=Directions.htm>Mtn. View</a> — Movie:
<a href=http://www.thegodmovie.com/>The God Who Wasn't There</a></H3>
Bowling for Columbine did it to the gun culture.<br>
Super Size Me did it to fast food.<br>
Now The God Who Wasn't There does it to religion.<br>
Holding modern Christianity up to a bright spotlight, this bold and often hilarious new film asks the questions
few dare to ask.<br>
Your guide through the world of Christendom is former fundamentalist Brian Flemming, joined by such luminaries as professor Richard Dawkins, Jesus Seminar fellow Robert M. Price, author Sam Harris and historian Richard Carrier.<p>
We learned:<br>
* The early founders of Christianity seem wholly unaware of the idea of a human Jesus<br>
* The Jesus of the Gospels bears a striking resemblance to other ancient heroes and the figureheads of
pagan savior cults<br>
* Contemporary Christians are largely ignorant of the origins of their religion<br>
* Fundamentalism is as strong today as it ever has been, with an alarming 44% of Americans believing Jesus
will return to earth in their lifetimes<br>
* And God simply wasn't there.<p>
Newsweek says The God Who Wasn't There "irreverently lays out the case that Jesus Christ never existed."
The Los Angeles Times calls it "provocative -- to put it mildly."

<p><hr><H3>Wednesday, Sep. 14, 7 pm, near San Diego — Debate: Does God Exist?</H3>
Mark debated <a href=http://www.bobsiegel.net/>Bob Siegel</a> at <a href=http://www.newlifesd.com/>New Life Church</a> in El Cajon, CA. Of course, few if any true believers were swayed by mere facts, evidence and logic.

— <i>The End of Faith</i> - Review of Sam Harris' Book</h3>
Is there reason to be optimistic about the state of the world and
Atheists' role in it? Or are we destined for some brand of
Muslim/Christian/Jewish theocracy & nuclear disaster? What role does
Atheism play in creating a better world and thwarting horrors?

— Logical Thinking & Transit - Mutually Exclusive?</h3>
Why did environmental and transit groups oppose a tax to fund public
transit in Nov. 2000? What is the real story on what's happening with
plans to improve public transit? And what place does rational
discourse have in the world of transit politics?<p>
Margaret Okuzumi, the executive director of BayRail Alliance,
helped us to think critically about transit options (Is BART-San Jose
really a good idea?) and to understand why government has failed to act
logically despite the efforts of advocacy groups such as the Sierra Club.

<p><hr><H3>Tuesday, June 28, 10:00 am - 10 Commandments Rally in San Francisco</h3>
Today the Atheists of the Bay Area held a rally at the steps of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in SF, over
the rulings from the Supreme Court on the government displays of the 10 Commandments. We had a great turnout
with about 30 Atheists and Humanists. Dave Kong, CA State Director for American Atheists, organized the
event. Here is what he sent out after the rally, "Please pass on my gratitude to those in your group who participated in today's rally. These events can only be successful when we have a good turnout, and today was a very good turnout, especially for a Tuesday morning."<p>
Our own Ed Gauci took many pictures of our rally and put
them <a href=http://edsphotos.us/sfrally20050628/>on the web</a>.<p>
American Atheists also held a rally in D.C. Here is a <a href=IMAGES/10Cs.jpg>photo from the New York
Times</a> showing a reverend in DC discussing the decisions, with American Atheists' signs being held over
his head in the background. American Atheists strikes again!<p>
"It is true that many Americans find the Commandments in accord with their personal beliefs. But we do not
count heads before enforcing the First Amendment."<br>
— Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, concurring in a ruling against government displays of religious symbols.

<p>Objectivism is a philosophy founded by Ayn Rand, author of <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> and <i>The Fountainhead</i>.
While all Objectivists are Atheists, not all Atheists are familiar with Objectivism. Steve Nahm, coordinator
of the <a href=http://www.objectivists.org>Silicon Valley Objectivists</a>,
presented a guide to Objectivism for Atheists. He discussed the many ways Objectivism shares ideas
with other Atheists, and believes that Objectivism is a life-affirming philosophy that every Atheist should know.
He also talked about ways in which Objectivism addresses issues we come up against
regularly, such as its ethics, which is derived from the nature of people, not from supernatural beliefs.

Brian Davis, member of the local Humanist Community, described local
work being done to promote Clean Money campaigns. According to their
website, "Clean Money, Clean Elections (CMCE) reduces the influence of
special interest money and provides a level playing field by offering
qualified candidates a limited and equal amount of public funds. It's a
bold, new experiment in campaign finance reform, seeking to restore
democracy and the principle of one person, one vote." Atheists have
always supported human beings solving human problems (who else is
there?!)

Ellen Johnson and Dave Silverman (American Atheists President & Communications Director) were on
<i>Scarborough Country</i> recently, along with a few xtians and a rabbi.
The topic was whether god caused the tsunami in Asia. Ellen and Dave were human, personable, and caring.
They were the only ones who seemed genuinely concerned with the victims of the tsunami. The others seemed more
concerned with their religious messages and positions -- often trading insults of blasphemy over who knew
(or could know) the mind of their god. Pat Robertson was overtly callous -- smiling and laughing.<p>
The transcripts are <a href=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6790691/>Jan. 4, for Dave</a> and
<a href=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6795983/>Jan. 5, for Ellen</a>.
