<h1>God's dupes</h1>
<b>Moderate believers give cover to religious fanatics -- and are every bit as delusional.<p></b>

PETE STARK, a California Democrat, appears to be the first
congressman in U.S. history to acknowledge that he doesn't believe
in God. In a country in which 83% of the population thinks that the
Bible is the literal or "inspired" word of the creator of the
universe, this took political courage.<p>
Of course, one can imagine that Cicero's handlers in the 1st century
BC lost some sleep when he likened the traditional accounts of the
Greco-Roman gods to the "dreams of madmen" and to the "insane
mythology of Egypt."<p>
Mythology is where all gods go to die, and it seems that Stark has
secured a place in American history simply by admitting that a fresh
grave should be dug for the God of Abraham — the jealous, genocidal,
priggish and self-contradictory tyrant of the Bible and the Koran.
Stark is the first of our leaders to display a level of intellectual
honesty befitting a consul of ancient Rome. Bravo.<p>
The truth is, there is not a person on Earth who has a good reason
to believe that Jesus rose from the dead or that Muhammad spoke to
the angel Gabriel in a cave. And yet billions of people claim to be
certain about such things. As a result, Iron Age ideas about
everything high and low — sex, cosmology, gender equality, immortal
souls, the end of the world, the validity of prophecy, etc. —
continue to divide our world and subvert our national discourse.
Many of these ideas, by their very nature, hobble science, inflame
human conflict and squander scarce resources.<p>
Of course, no religion is monolithic. Within every faith one can see
people arranged along a spectrum of belief. Picture concentric
circles of diminishing reasonableness: At the center, one finds the
truest of true believers — the Muslim jihadis, for instance, who not
only support suicidal terrorism but who are the first to turn
themselves into bombs; or the Dominionist Christians, who openly
call for homosexuals and blasphemers to be put to death.<p>
Outside this sphere of maniacs, one finds millions more who share
their views but lack their zeal. Beyond them, one encounters pious
multitudes who respect the beliefs of their more deranged brethren
but who disagree with them on small points of doctrine — of course
the world is going to end in glory and Jesus will appear in the sky
like a superhero, but we can't be sure it will happen in our
lifetime.<p>
Out further still, one meets religious moderates and liberals of
diverse hues — people who remain supportive of the basic scheme that
has balkanized our world into Christians, Muslims and Jews, but who
are less willing to profess certainty about any article of faith. Is
Jesus really the son of God? Will we all meet our grannies again in
heaven? Moderates and liberals are none too sure.<p>
Those on this spectrum view the people further toward the center as
too rigid, dogmatic and hostile to doubt, and they generally view
those outside as corrupted by sin, weak-willed or unchurched.<p>
The problem is that wherever one stands on this continuum, one
inadvertently shelters those who are more fanatical than oneself
from criticism. Ordinary fundamentalist Christians, by maintaining
that the Bible is the perfect word of God, inadvertently support the
Dominionists — men and women who, by the millions, are quietly
working to turn our country into a totalitarian theocracy
reminiscent of John Calvin's Geneva. Christian moderates, by their
lingering attachment to the unique divinity of Jesus, protect the
faith of fundamentalists from public scorn. Christian liberals — who
aren't sure what they believe but just love the experience of going
to church occasionally — deny the moderates a proper collision with
scientific rationality. And in this way centuries have come and gone
without an honest word being spoken about God in our society.<p>
People of all faiths — and none — regularly change their lives for
the better, for good and bad reasons. And yet such transformations
are regularly put forward as evidence in support of a specific
religious creed. President Bush has cited his own sobriety as
suggestive of the divinity of Jesus. No doubt Christians do get
sober from time to time — but Hindus (polytheists) and atheists do
as well. How, therefore, can any thinking person imagine that his
experience of sobriety lends credence to the idea that a supreme
being is watching over our world and that Jesus is his son?<p>
There is no question that many people do good things in the name of
their faith — but there are better reasons to help the poor, feed
the hungry and defend the weak than the belief that an Imaginary
Friend wants you to do it. Compassion is deeper than religion. As is
ecstasy. It is time that we acknowledge that human beings can be
profoundly ethical — and even spiritual — without pretending to know
things they do not know.<p>
Let us hope that Stark's candor inspires others in our government to
admit their doubts about God. Indeed, it is time we broke this spell
en masse. Every one of the world's "great" religions utterly
trivializes the immensity and beauty of the cosmos. Books like the
Bible and the Koran get almost every significant fact about us and
our world wrong. Every scientific domain — from cosmology to
psychology to economics — has superseded and surpassed the wisdom of
Scripture.<p>
Everything of value that people get from religion can be had more
honestly, without presuming anything on insufficient evidence. The
rest is self-deception, set to music.</div>
