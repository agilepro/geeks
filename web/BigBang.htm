 <font size="3"><strong>San Diego</strong> -- Astronomers reported Tuesday that
 they had convincingly detected, in the patterns of galaxies scattered across
 the night sky, the vestiges of sound waves that rumbled through the universe
 after the Big Bang.
 <p>Stars and galaxies tended to form along the ripples of the sound waves
 where matter was slightly denser, and the pull of gravity was slightly
 stronger. The ripples preserve a picture of the universe when it was only
 about 1 million years old and fit well with astronomers' ideas of how the
 universe, which started smooth and uniform, became lumpy with stars, gas
 clouds and other celestial objects.
 <p>Two teams of researchers analyzing the locations of thousands of galaxies
 from two sections of the sky reported similar findings on the sound waves at a
 meeting of the American Astronomical Society in San Diego. Earlier research
 had found signs of the ripples, but "we regard this as smoking-gun
 evidence," said Dr. Daniel Eisenstein of the University of Arizona, lead
 investigator of one of the teams.
 <p>"The important picture we have of the universe is hanging together
 amazingly well," said Dr. Martin Rees, a professor of cosmology and
 astrophysics at Cambridge University who was not involved with either team.
 "The standard picture is firming up."
 <p>According to that picture, matter was evenly distributed in all directions
 for the first instant after the Big Bang. But then burbling caused by the
 physics of quantum mechanics created slight imperfections, clumps that were
 slightly denser with ordinary matter, as well as dark matter, the unknown
 material that accounts for most of the mass in the universe.
 <p>Just as ripples spread out from a pebble dropped in a pond, sound waves
 spread out from the dense clumps through the hot gas made of matter, which is
 composed of electrons and protons, and of photons, or particles of light.
 <p>About 400,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe cooled enough that the
 charged electrons and protons combined to form hydrogen atoms, which allowed
 most of the photons to escape the hot gas. Several years ago, astronomers
 detected the sound waves etched by the photons.
 <p>The sound waves continued to spread for an additional 600,000 years, and
 when the last remaining photons escaped, the waves stopped, roughly 500,000
 light-years from the dense clumps that produced them. When stars began to
 form, they tended to form around either the clumps of dark matter or along the
 ripples.
 <p>As the universe has expanded in the 13.7 billion years since then, the
 typical distance between ripple and clump has stretched to 500 million light-
 years.
 <p>The new research shows the matter component of the early sound waves.
 Galaxies in the present universe are more likely to be 500 million light-years
 apart than other distances, Eisenstein said. One light-year is the distance
 light travels in a year, or 6 trillion miles.
 <p>Eisenstein and his colleagues used information from the Sloan Digital Sky
 Survey, which is mapping galaxies with a telescope in New Mexico. The other
 team used figures from a sky survey called 2dF, which stands for the 2-degree
 field of view being surveyed by a telescope in Australia.
 <p>As the astronomers look farther away and further back in time, the size of
 the ripples will decrease in size. The ripples could serve as a convenient
 yardstick to track the history of the universe's expansion. That could shed
 light on dark energy, a mysterious cosmological force discovered in the past
 few years that, at cosmological distances, is stronger than gravity and is
 causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate.
