Sunday, May 14 - "Why Naturalism? The Value of a Sound Naturalist Worldview" for Atheists and Other Freethinkers 

TIME: 2:30-5pm; LOCATION: Sierra 2 Center, Community Room 10, 2791 24TH St., Sacramento, California 95818; SUBJECT: Richard Carrier will draw from and summarize his book, "Sense and Goodness without God: A Defense of Metaphysical Naturalism," explaining what "metaphysical naturalism" is, why it makes more sense than religion, and how it solves some important questions about ourselves, our world, and our future. This will include the nature and importance of philosophy in general, and what naturalist philosophy entails specifically, especially regarding the nature of morality, of the universe, and of the human mind. There will also be some discussion of what beauty is, and whether the purpose of government is to enforce a democratically-elected morality. After the talk Carrier will be signing and selling copies of his book for $20. URL FOR MORE INFORMATION: http://www.aofonline.org
