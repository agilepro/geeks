"THE 10 COMMANDMENTS AS PRACTICED BY JUDGE ROY MOORE"
(From Mad Magazine, page 44, # 437, January 2004)

"I. Thou shalt have no god before mine."
"II. Thou shalt not worship graven images--like the U.S. Constitution."
"III. Thou shalt take the Lord's name and vainly attempt to use it to advance thine political career."
"IV. Remember the Sabbath Day--so you can watch me getting free publicity and denouncing my critics on all the Sunday morning talk shows."
"V. Honour they father and thy mother--but not necessarily thy Founding Fathers."
"VI. Thou shalt not kill--except for the separation of church and state."
"VII. Thou shalt not commit adultery--but thou may be unfaithfull to the principles thou swore to uphold as an officer of the court."
"VIII. Thou shalt not steal my two-and a half ton monument from the courthouse rotunda where I installed it in the dead of night."
"IX. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor--unless your neighbor is a liberal, atheist, or fellow Alabama Supreme Court Justice."
"X. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods. But exploiting thy religion to covet higher office is A-Okay."
