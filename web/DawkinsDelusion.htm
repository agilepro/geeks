<p><i>Alister McGrath, a biochemist and Professor of Historical Theology
at Oxford University, may be Richard Dawkins' most prominent critic. As
the author of "Dawkins' God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life," he
was interviewed extensively for Dawkins'
recent documentary, <a href="http://alternet.org/movies/45388/">"The
Root of All Evil?"</a> Not a frame of these interviews made it into the
final edit. Below is a slightly modified version of remarks delivered by
McGrath in response to Dawkins' latest book, "The God Delusion."</i>
<p><i>The God Delusion</i> has established Dawkins as the world's most
high-profile atheist polemicist, who directs a withering criticism
against every form of religion. He is out to convert his readers. "If
this book works as I intend, religious readers who open it will be
atheists when they put it down." Not that he thinks that this is
particularly likely; after all, he suggests, "dyed-in-the-wool
faith-heads are immune to argument." Along with Daniel Dennett and Sam
Harris, Dawkins directs a ferocious trade of criticism against religion
in general and Christianity in particular. In this article, I propose to
explore two major questions. First, why this sudden outburst of
aggression? Second, how reliable are Dawkins' criticisms of religion?
<p>Let's begin by looking at the first question. Every worldview,
whether religious or not, has its point of vulnerability. There is a
tension between theory and experience, raising questions over the
coherence and trustworthiness of the worldview itself. In the case of
Christianity, many locate that point of weakness in the existence of
suffering within the world. In the case of atheism, it is the
persistence of belief in God, when there is supposedly no God in which
to believe.
<p>Until recently, western atheism had waited patiently, believing that
belief in God would simply die out. But now, a whiff of panic is
evident. Far from dying out, belief in God has rebounded, and seems set
to exercise still greater influence in both the public and private
spheres. <i>The God Delusion</i> expresses this deep anxiety, partly
reflecting an intense distaste for religion. Yet there is something
deeper here, often overlooked in the heat of debate. The anxiety is that
the coherence of atheism itself is at stake. Might the unexpected
resurgence of religion persuade many that atheism itself is fatally
flawed as a worldview?
<p>That's what Dawkins is worried about. The shrill, aggressive rhetoric
of his <i>God Delusion</i> masks a deep insecurity about the public
credibility of atheism. <i>The God Delusion</i> seems more designed to
reassure atheists whose faith is faltering than to engage fairly or
rigorously with religious believers, and others seeking for truth.
(Might this be because the writer is himself an atheist whose faith is
faltering?) Religious believers will be dismayed by its ritual
stereotyping of religion, and will find its manifest lack of fairness a
significant disincentive to take its arguments and concerns seriously.
Seekers after truth who would not consider themselves religious may also
find themselves shocked by Dawkins' aggressive rhetoric, his
substitution of personal creedal statements for objective engagement
with evidence, his hectoring and bullying tone towards "dyed-in-the-wool
faith-heads," and his utter determination to find nothing but fault with
religion of any kind.
<p>It is this deep, unsettling anxiety about the future of atheism which
explains the high degree of dogmatism and aggressive rhetorical style of
this new secular fundamentalism. The dogmatism of the work has been the
subject of intense criticism in the secular press, reflecting growing
alarm within the secularist community about the damage that Dawkins is
doing to their public reputation. Many of those who might be expected to
support Dawkins are running for cover, trying to distance themselves
from this embarrassment.
<p>To give an example: <i>The God Delusion</i> trumpets the fact that
its author was recently voted one of the world's three leading
intellectuals. This survey took place among the readers of <i>Prospect</i>
magazine in November 2005. So what did this same <i>Prospect</i>
magazine make of the book? Its reviewer was shocked at this "incurious,
dogmatic, rambling, and self-contradictory" book. The title of the
review? "Dawkins the dogmatist."
<p>But what of the arguments themselves? <i>The God Delusion</i> is
often little more than an aggregation of convenient factoids, suitably
overstated to achieve maximum impact, and loosely arranged to suggest
that they constitute an argument. This makes dealing with its
"arguments" a little problematical, in that the work frequently
substitutes aggressive, bullying rhetoric for serious evidence-based
argument. Dawkins often treats evidence as something to shoehorn into
his preconceived theoretical framework. Religion is persistently and
consistently portrayed in the worst possible way, mimicking the worst
features of religious fundamentalism's portrayal of atheism.
<p>Space is limited, so let's look his two core arguments -- that
religion can be explained away on scientific grounds, and that religion
leads to violence. Dawkins dogmatically insists that religious belief is
"blind trust," which refuses to take due account of evidence, or subject
itself to examination. So why do people believe in God, when there is no
God to believe in? For Dawkins, religion is simply the accidental and
unnecessary outcome of biological or psychological processes. His
arguments for this bold assertion are actually quite weak, and rest on
an astonishingly superficial engagement with scientific studies.
<p>For example, consider this important argument in <i>The God Delusion</i>.
Since belief in God is utterly irrational (one of Dawkins' core beliefs,
by the way), there has to be some biological or psychological way of
explaining why so many people -- in fact, by far the greater part of the
world's population -- fall victim to such a delusion. One of the
explanations that Dawkins offers is that believing in God is like being
infected with a contagious virus, which spreads throughout entire
populations. Yet the analogy -- belief in God is like a virus -- seems
to then assume ontological substance. Belief in God is a virus of the
mind. Yet biological viruses are not merely hypothesized; they can be
identified, observed, and their structure and mode of operation
determined. Yet this hypothetical "virus of the mind" is an essentially
polemical construction, devised to discredit ideas that Dawkins does not like.
<p>So are all ideas viruses of the mind? Dawkins draws an absolute
distinction between rational, scientific and evidence-based ideas, and
spurious, irrational notions -- such as religious beliefs. The latter,
not the former, count as mental viruses. But who decides what is
"rational" and "scientific"? Dawkins does not see this as a problem,
believing that he can easily categorize such ideas, separating the sheep
from the goats.
<p>Except it all turns out to be horribly complicated, losing the
simplicity and elegance that marks a great idea. For instance, every
worldview -- religious or secular -- ends up falling into the category
of "belief systems," precisely because it cannot be proved. That is
simply the nature of worldviews, and everyone knows it. It prevents
nobody from holding a worldview in the first place, and doing so with
complete intellectual integrity in the second. In the end, Dawkins' idea
simply implodes, falling victim to his own subjective judgement of what
is rational and true. It's not an idea that is taken seriously within
the scientific community, and can safely be disregarded.
<p>The main argument of <i>The God Delusion</i>, however, is that
religion leads to violence and oppression. Dawkins treats this as
defining characteristic of religion, airbrushing out of his somewhat
skimpy account of the roots of violence any suggestion that it might be
the result of political fanaticism -- or even atheism. He is adamant
that he himself, as a good atheist, would never, ever fly airplanes into
skyscrapers, or commit any other outrageous act of violence or
oppression. Good for him. Neither would I. Yet the harsh reality is that
religious and anti-religious violence has happened, and is likely to
continue to do so.
<p>As someone who grew up in Northern Ireland, I know about religious
violence only too well. There is no doubt that religion can generate
violence. But it's not alone in this. The history of the twentieth
century has given us a frightening awareness of how political extremism
can equally cause violence. In Latin America, millions of people seem to
have "disappeared" as a result of ruthless campaigns of violence by
right wing politicians and their militias. In Cambodia, Pol Pot
eliminated his millions in the name of socialism.
<p>The rise of the Soviet Union was of particular significance. Lenin
regarded the elimination of religion as central to the socialist
revolution, and put in place measures designed to eradicate religious
beliefs through the "protracted use of violence." One of the greatest
tragedies of this dark era in human history was that those who sought to
eliminate religious belief through violence and oppression believed they
were justified in doing so. They were accountable to no higher authority
than the state.
<p>In one of his more bizarre creedal statements as an atheist, Dawkins
insists that there is "not the smallest evidence" that atheism
systematically influences people to do bad things. It's an astonishing,
naïve, and somewhat sad statement. The facts are otherwise. In their
efforts to enforce their atheist ideology, the Soviet authorities
systematically destroyed and eliminated the vast majority of churches
and priests during the period 1918-41. The statistics make for dreadful
reading. This violence and repression was undertaken in pursuit of an
atheist agenda -- the elimination of religion. This doesn't fit with
Dawkins' highly sanitized, idealized picture of atheism. Dawkins is
clearly an ivory tower atheist, disconnected from the real and brutal
world of the twentieth century.
<p>Dawkins develops a criticism that is often directed against religion
in works of atheist apologetics -- namely, that it encourages the
formation and maintenance of "in-groups" and "out-groups." For Dawkins,
removing religion is essential if this form of social demarcation and
discrimination is to be defeated. But what, many will wonder, about
Jesus of Nazareth? Wasn't this a core theme of his teaching -- that the
love of God transcends, and subsequently abrogates, such social divisions?
<p>Dawkins' analysis here is unacceptable. There are points at which his
ignorance of religion ceases to be amusing, and simply becomes risible.
In dealing with this question he draws extensively on a paper published
in <i>Skeptic</i> magazine in 1995 by John Hartung, which asserts that
-- and here I cite Dawkin's summary: Jesus was a devotee of the same
in-group morality -- coupled with out-group hostility -- that was taken
for granted in the Old Testament. Jesus was a loyal Jew. It was Paul who
invented the idea of taking the Jewish God to the Gentiles. Hartung puts
it more bluntly than I dare: "Jesus would have turned over in his grave
if he had known that Paul would be taking his plan to the pigs." Many
Christian readers of this will be astonished at this bizarre
misrepresentation of things being presented as if it were gospel truth.
Yet, I regret to say, it is representative of Dawkins' method: ridicule,
distort, belittle, and demonize. Still, at least it will give Christian
readers an idea of the lack of any scholarly objectivity or basic human
sense of fairness which now pervades atheist fundamentalism.
<p>There is little point in arguing with such fundamentalist nonsense.
It's about as worthwhile as trying to persuade a flat-earther that the
world is actually round. Dawkins seems to be so deeply trapped within
his own worldview that he cannot assess alternatives. Yet many readers
would value a more reliable and informed response, rather than accepting
Dawkins' increasingly tedious antireligious tirades. Let's look at
things as they actually stand.
<p>In the first place, Jesus explicitly extends the Old Testament
command to "love your neighbour" to "love your enemy" (<i>Matthew 5.44</i>).
Far from endorsing "out-group hostility," Jesus both commended and
commanded an ethic of "out-group affirmation." As this feature of the
teaching of Jesus of Nazareth is so well-known and distinctive, it is
inexcusable that Dawkins should make no mention of it. Christians may
certainly be accused of failing to live up to this demand. But it is
there, right at the heart of the Christian ethic.
<p>In the second place, many readers would point out that the familiar
story of the Good Samaritan (<i>Luke 10</i>) makes it clear that the
command to "love your neighbour" extends far beyond Judaism. (Indeed,
this aspect of the teaching of Jesus of Nazareth seems to have resulted
in people suspecting Jesus of actually being a Samaritan: see <i>John
8.48</i>). It is certainly true that Jesus, a Palestinian Jew, gave
priority to the Jews as God's chosen people, but his definition of who
was a "true Jew" was radically broad. It included those who had excluded
themselves from Judaism by intimate collaborators with Roman occupying
forces. One of the main charges levelled against Jesus by his critics
within Judaism was his open acceptance of these out-groups. Indeed a
substantial part of his teaching can be seen as a defence of his
behaviour towards them. Jesus' welcome of marginalized groups, who
inhabited an ambiguous position between "in" and "out" is also well
attested in accounts of his willingness to touch those considered by his
culture to be ritually unclean (for instance <i>Matthew 8.3</i>, <i>
Matthew 9.20-25</i>).
<p>So what are we to make of this shrill and petulant manifesto of
atheist fundamentalism? Aware of the moral obligation of a critic of
religion to deal with this phenomenon at its best and most persuasive,
many atheists have been disturbed by Dawkins' crude stereotypes, vastly
over-simplified binary oppositions ("science is good, religion is bad"),
straw men, and seemingly pathological hostility towards religion. Might
<i>The God Delusion</i> actually backfire, and end up persuading people
that atheism is just as intolerant, doctrinaire and disagreeable as the
worst that religion can offer? As the atheist philosopher Michael Ruse
commented recently: "<i>The God Delusion</i> makes me embarrassed to be
an atheist."
<p>Dawkins seems to think that saying something more loudly and
confidently, while ignoring or trivializing counter-evidence, will
persuade the open-minded that religious belief is a type of delusion.
For the gullible and credulous, it is the confidence with which
something is said that persuades, rather than the evidence offered in
its support. Dawkins' astonishingly superficial and inaccurate portrayal
of Christianity will simply lead Christians to conclude that he does not
know what he is talking about -- and that his atheism may therefore rest
on a series of errors and misunderstandings. Ironically the ultimate
achievement of <i>The God Delusion</i> for modern atheism may be to
suggest that it is actually atheism itself may be a delusion about God.
