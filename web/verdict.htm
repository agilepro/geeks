<h2>The Verdict Is In</h2>

<p>Sanctions worked. Weapons inspectors worked. That is the bottom line of
the long-awaited report on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq,
written by President Bush's handpicked investigator.
<p>In the 18 months since President Bush ordered the invasion of
Iraq, justifying the decision by saying that Saddam Hussein was
"a gathering threat" to the United States, Americans
have come to realize that Iraq had no chemical, nuclear or
biological weapons. But the report issued yesterday goes
further. It says that Iraq had no factories to produce illicit
weapons and that its ability to resume production was growing
more feeble every year. While Mr. Hussein retained dreams of
someday getting back into the chemical warfare business, his
chosen target was Iran, not the United States.
<p>The report shows that the international sanctions that Mr.
Bush dismissed and demeaned before the war - and still does -
were astonishingly effective. Mr. Hussein hoped to get out from
under the sanctions, and the report's author, Charles Duelfer,
loyally told Congress yesterday that he thought that could have
happened. But his report said the Iraqis lacked even a formal
strategy or a plan to reconstitute their weapons programs if it
did.
<p>For months, administration officials have tried to deflect
charges that they invaded Iraq under false pretenses and have
urged critics to wait for Mr. Duelfer's verdict on the weapons
search. The authoritative findings of his Iraq Survey Group have
now left the administration's rationale for war more tattered
than ever. It turns out that Iraq destroyed all stockpiles of
illicit weapons more than a decade ago and had no large-scale
production facilities left after 1996, seven years before the
invasion. This was a matter of choice by Saddam Hussein, who
desperately wanted an end to sanctions and feared that any
weapons programs, if discovered by inspectors, would only keep
them in place.
<p>Even after U.N. inspectors left Iraq in 1998, a period when
Western intelligence experts assumed the worst might be
happening, the Hussein regime made no active efforts to produce
new weapons of mass destruction. The much-feared nuclear threat
- that looming mushroom cloud conjured by the administration to
stampede Congress into authorizing an invasion - was a phantom.
Mr. Duelfer found that even if Iraq had tried to restart its
defunct nuclear program in 2003, it would have needed years to
produce a nuclear weapon.
<p>Since any objective observer should by now have digested the
idea that Iraq posed no imminent threat to anyone, let alone the
United States, it was disturbing to hear President Bush and Vice
President Dick Cheney continue to try to justify the invasion
this week on the grounds that after Sept. 11, 2001, Iraq was
clearly the most likely place for terrorists to get illicit
weapons. Even if Mr. Hussein had wanted to arm groups he could
not control - a very dubious notion- he had nothing to give
them.
<p>Administration officials will no doubt point to sections of
the report citing evidence that front companies were supplying
Iraq with banned materials, and that Iraq had money and
expertise that could be used to make weapons. They will also
point to Mr. Duelfer's speculation that support for the
sanctions was eroding. But nothing in the voluminous record
provides Mr. Bush with the justification he wanted for a
preventive war because the weapons programs did not exist. And
as the war continues to bog down, the power of nonviolent
international sanctions looks more muscular every day.
