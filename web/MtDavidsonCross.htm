San Francisco's Mt. Davidson Cross Suit Continues!</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'><br>
<br>
After waiting nine months, American Atheists' suit against the transfer of San
Francisco's Mt. Davidson cross and surrounding park land is finally moving
forward.<br>
<br>
Last September, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against American
Atheists' claim that the transfer as structured was unconstitutional.&nbsp;
That decision was based on a precedent set by a lawsuit against a similar
transfer of a public cross called the Mt. Soledad Cross in San Diego.<br>
<br>
In October, both American Atheists and the San Diego plaintiff requested an en
banc review of their respective suits.&nbsp; An en banc review is a review of
the decision by an 11-judge panel.&nbsp; Since the Mt. Davidson decision was
dependent upon the outcome of the San Diego case (Paulson v. City of San
Diego), the court then put the Mt. Davidson decision on hold until the San
Diego case had a final determination.<br>
<br>
The court held the en banc hearing for Paulson in Phoenix on March 21.&nbsp; On
June 26, they reversed the original 3-judge panel decision and sent the case
back to the district court for a remedy.<br>
<br>
The court determined that the City, by requiring that the land be used for a
war memorial, was providing a subsidy for parties wanting to use the cross as
their memorial.&nbsp; In other words, if two parties - one wanting to keep the
cross and the other wanting to remove it - both have the same amount of money
to spend, the party wishing to keep the cross standing would have a financial
advantage in the bidding process, because they could bid all of their available
resources, whereas the party wishing to remove the cross would have to reserve
funds in order to both remove the cross and then erect a suitable war memorial.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, the Ninth Circuit en banc panel stated:<br>
<br>
"The second sale of the Mt. Soledad land on which the cross stands was
structured to provide a direct, immediate, and substantial financial advantage
to bidders who had the sectarian purpose of preserving the cross.&nbsp; For
that reason, the sale violated article XVI, section 5 of the California
Constitution."<br>
<br>
Now that the precedent has been reversed, the court is once again looking at
the Mt. Davidson transfer.&nbsp; All parties involved in the Mt. Davidson action
have 3 weeks in which to file a brief explaining how the Paulson decision
affects our case.<br>
<br>
Plaintiffs Dave Kong (CA director for American Atheists) and John Messina are
very pleased that the suit is going forward, and appreciate the support that so
many have shown.&nbsp; They want to thank everyone who contributed to the en
banc filing, who made this next step possible.<br>
<br>
Messina and Kong are also trying to raise money to finance the next brief and
subsequent hearing.&nbsp; Anyone wishing to support this next step should
