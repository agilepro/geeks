Hi Alex,

There were 4 people who were opposed to ASV endorsing the Planned Parenthood ad, and I sent emails to all.  I got their reasons for opposing, and their willingness to go along with our endorsing the ad -- even if that is not what they would prefer.

It did set a bit of precedent, but every situation is and will be unique.  We probably won't be able to do things too often that everyone will agree with, and won't necessarily get a buy-in from the group.  If you want to get active in running the group, I suggest that you join us in the admin group.  We could use some committed help.

godlessly,
Mark
