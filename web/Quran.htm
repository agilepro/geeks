2.191. And slay them wherever ye catch them, and turn them out from where they have Turned you out; for tumult
and oppression are worse than slaughter; but fight them not at the Sacred Mosque, unless they (first) fight you
there; but if they fight you, slay them. Such is the reward of those who suppress faith.<p>
2.192. But if they cease, Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.<p>

Allah. But if they cease, Let there be no hostility except to those who practise oppression.<p>

good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not.<p>

light. Of those who reject faith the patrons are the evil ones: from light they will lead them forth into the

3.9. The only religion in the sight of God is Islam.<p>
3.85. If anyone desires a religion other than Islam, never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter,
he will be in the ranks of those who have lost (their selves in the Hellfire).<p>
3:118. O ye who believe! Take not into your intimacy those outside your ranks: They will not fail to corrupt
you. They only desire your ruin: Rank hatred has already appeared from their mouths: What their hearts conceal
is far worse. We have made plain to you the Signs, if ye have wisdom.<p>
3.141. Allah's object also is to purge those that are true in Faith and to deprive of blessing Those that
resist Faith.<p>
3.151 Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah,

3.157. And if ye are slain, or die, in the way of Allah, forgiveness and mercy from Allah are far better than all
they could amass.<p>
3.158. And if ye die, or are slain, Lo! it is unto Allah that ye are brought together.<p>
3.169. Think not of those who are slain in Allah's way as dead. Nay, they live, finding their sustenance in the
presence of their Lord;<p>
4.3. If ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans, Marry women of your choice, Two or three
or four; but if ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or (a captive) that
your right hands possess, that will be more suitable, to prevent you from doing injustice.<p>
4.14. But those who disobey Allah and His Messenger and transgress His limits will be admitted to a Fire, to abide
therein: And they shall have a humiliating punishment.<p>
4.15. If any of your women are guilty of lewdness, Take the evidence of four (Reliable) witnesses from amongst
you against them; and if they testify, confine them to houses until death do claim them, or Allah ordain for them
some (other) way.<p>

for Allah is Oft-returning, Most Merciful.<p>

and trade by mutual good-will: Nor kill (or destroy) yourselves: for verily Allah hath been to you Most Merciful!<p>
4.34. Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has given the one more (strength) than the
other, and because they support them from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient, and
guard in (the husband's) absence what Allah would have them guard. As to those women on whose part ye fear
disloyalty and ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (Next), refuse to share their beds, (And last) beat them
(lightly); but if they return to obedience, seek not against them Means (of annoyance): For Allah is Most High,
great (above you all).<p>
4.74. Let those fight in the cause of Allah Who sell the life of this world for the hereafter. To him who fighteth
in the cause of Allah,- whether he is slain or gets victory - Soon shall We give him a reward of great (value).<p>
4.76. Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah, and those who reject Faith Fight in the cause of Evil:
So fight ye against the friends of Satan: feeble indeed is the cunning of Satan.<p>
4.77. Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who were told to hold back their hands (from fight) but establish
regular prayers and spend in regular charity? When (at length) the order for fighting was issued to them, behold!
a section of them feared men as - or even more than - they should have feared Allah. They said: "Our Lord!
Why hast Thou ordered us to fight? Wouldst Thou not Grant us respite to our (natural) term, near (enough)?"
Say: "Short is the enjoyment of this world: the Hereafter is the best for those who do right:
Never will ye be dealt with unjustly in the very least!<p>
4.78. "Wherever ye are, death will find you out, even if ye are in towers built up strong and high!" If some good
befalls them, they say, "This is from Allah.; but if evil, they say, "This is from thee" (O Prophet). Say: "All
things are from Allah." But what hath come to these people, that they fail to understand a single fact?<p>
4.79. Whatever good, (O man!) happens to thee, is from Allah. but whatever evil happens to thee, is from thy (own)
soul. and We have sent thee as an apostle to (instruct) mankind. And enough is Allah for a witness.<p>
4.95. Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) and receive no hurt, and those who strive and fight in the
cause of Allah with their goods and their persons. Allah hath granted a grade higher to those who strive and fight
with their goods and persons than to those who sit (at home). Unto all (in Faith) Hath Allah promised good:
But those who strive and fight Hath He distinguished above those who sit (at home) by a special reward,-<p>
4.101. For the Unbelievers are unto you open enemies.<p>
4.160. For the iniquity of the Jews We made unlawful for them certain (foods) good and wholesome which had
been lawful for them;- in that they hindered many from Allah.s Way;<p>
4.161. That they took usury, though they were forbidden; and that they devoured men's substance
wrongfully;- we have prepared for those among them who reject faith a grievous punishment.<p>
5.14. From those, too, who call themselves Christians, We did take a covenant, but they forgot a good part of
the message that was sent them: so we estranged them, with enmity and hatred between the one and the other,
to the day of judgment. And soon will Allah show them what it is they have done.<p>
5.33. The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger, and strive with might and main for
mischief through the land is: execution, or crucifixion, or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides,
or exile from the land: that is their disgrace in this world, and a heavy punishment is theirs in the Hereafter;<p>
5.38. As to the thief, Male or female, cut off his or her hands: a punishment by way of example, from Allah,
for their crime: and Allah is Exalted in power.<p>
5.39. But if the thief repents after his crime, and amends his conduct, Allah turneth to him in forgiveness;
for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.<p>
5.51. O ye who believe! take not the Jews and the Christians for your friends and protectors: They are but friends
and protectors to each other. And he amongst you that turns to them (for friendship) is of them. Verily Allah
guideth not a people unjust.<p>
5.57. O ye who believe! take not for friends and protectors those who take your religion for a mockery or
sport,- whether among those who received the Scripture before you, or among those who reject Faith; but fear ye
Allah, if ye have faith (indeed).<p>
5.64. The Jews say: "(Allah)'s hand is tied up." Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for the
(blasphemy) they utter. Nay, both His hands are widely outstretched: He giveth and spendeth (of His bounty) as
He pleaseth. But the revelation that cometh to thee from Allah increaseth in most of them their obstinate
rebellion and blasphemy. Amongst them we have placed enmity and hatred till the Day of Judgment. Every time
they kindle the fire of war, Allah doth extinguish it; but they (ever) strive to do mischief on earth. And
Allah loveth not those who do mischief.<p>
5.69. Those who believe (in the Qur'an), those who follow the Jewish (scriptures), and the Sabians and the
Christians,- any who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and work righteousness,- on them shall be no fear,
nor shall they grieve.<p>
5.72. They do blaspheme who say: "(Allah) is Christ the son of Mary." But said Christ: "O Children of Israel!
worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord." Whoever joins other gods with Allah,- Allah will forbid him the garden,
and the Fire will be his abode. There will for the wrong-doers be no one to help.<p>
5.73. They do blaspheme who say: Allah is one of three in a Trinity: for there is no god except One Allah. If they
desist not from their word (of blasphemy), verily a grievous penalty will befall the blasphemers among them.<p>
5.82. Strongest among men in enmity to the believers wilt thou find the Jews and Pagans; and nearest among them
in love to the believers wilt thou find those who say, "We are Christians": because amongst these are men devoted
to learning and men who have renounced the world, and they are not arrogant.<p>
7.96. If the people of the towns had but believed and feared Allah, We should indeed have opened out to them (All kinds
of) blessings from heaven and earth; but they rejected (the truth), and We brought them to book for their misdeeds.<p>
7.97. Did the people of the towns feel secure against the coming of Our wrath by night while they were asleep?<p>
7.98. Or else did they feel secure against its coming in broad daylight while they played about (care-free)?<p>
8.12. Remember thy Lord inspired the angels (with the message): "I am with you: give firmness to the Believers:
I will instil terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers: smite ye above their necks and smite all their finger-tips
off them."<p>
8.13. This because they contended against Allah and His Messenger. If any contend against Allah and His Messenger,
Allah is strict in punishment.<p>
8.14. Thus (will it be said): "Taste ye then of the (punishment): for those who resist Allah, is the penalty of
the Fire."<p>
8.15. O ye who believe! when ye meet the Unbelievers in hostile array, never turn your backs to them.<p>
8.16. If any do turn his back to them on such a day - unless it be in a stratagem of war, or to retreat to a troop
(of his own)- he draws on himself the wrath of Allah, and his abode is Hell,- an evil refuge (indeed)!<p>
8.17. It is not ye who slew them; it was Allah. when thou threwest (a handful of dust), it was not thy act, but
Allah's: in order that He might test the Believers by a gracious trial from Himself: for Allah is He Who heareth
and knoweth (all things).<p>
8.18. That, and also because Allah is He Who makes feeble the plans and stratagem of the Unbelievers.<p>
8.36. The Unbelievers spend their wealth to hinder (man) from the path of Allah, and so will they continue to spend;
but in the end they will have (only) regrets and sighs; at length they will be overcome: and the Unbelievers will
be gathered together to Hell;<p>
8.38. Say to the Unbelievers, if (now) they desist (from Unbelief), their past would be forgiven them; but if
they persist, the punishment of those before them is already (a matter of warning for them).<p>
8.39. And fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in
Allah altogether and everywhere; but if they cease, verily Allah doth see all that they do.<p>
8.41. And know that out of all the booty that ye may acquire (in war), a fifth share is assigned to Allah,- and to
the Messenger, and to near relatives, orphans, the needy, and the wayfarer,- if ye do believe in Allah and in the
revelation We sent down to Our servant on the Day of Testing,- the Day of the meeting of the two forces. For Allah
hath power over all things.<p>
8.55. For the worst of beasts in the sight of Allah are those who reject Him: They will not believe.<p>
8.65. O Messenger. rouse the Believers to the fight. If there are twenty amongst you, patient and persevering,
they will vanquish two hundred: if a hundred, they will vanquish a thousand of the Unbelievers: for these are
a people without understanding.<p>
8.67. It is not fitting for an apostle that he should have prisoners of war until he hath thoroughly subdued
the land. Ye look for the temporal goods of this world; but Allah looketh to the Hereafter: And Allah is Exalted
in might, Wise.<p>
9.5. But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, an seize them,
beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war); but if they repent, and establish regular
prayers and practise regular charity, then open the way for them: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.<p>
9.6. If one amongst the Pagans ask thee for asylum, grant it to him, so that he may hear the word of Allah. And
then escort him to where he can be secure. That is because they are men without knowledge.<p>
9.23. O ye who believe! take not for protectors your fathers and your brothers if they love infidelity above
Faith: if any of you do so, they do wrong.<p>
9.28. O ye who believe! Truly the Pagans are unclean;<p>
9.38. O ye who believe! what is the matter with you, that, when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of Allah,
ye cling heavily to the earth? Do ye prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter? But little is the comfort
of this life, as compared with the Hereafter.<p>
9.39. Unless ye go forth, He will punish you with a grievous penalty, and put others in your place; but Him ye
would not harm in the least. For Allah hath power over all things.<p>
9.51. Say: "Nothing will happen to us except what Allah has decreed for us: He is our protector": and on
Allah let the Believers put their trust.<p>
9.60. Truly, if the Hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease, and those who stir up sedition in the City,
desist not, We shall certainly stir thee up against them: Then will they not be able to stay in it as thy neighbours for any length of time:<p>
9.61. They shall have a curse on them: whenever they are found, they shall be seized and slain (without mercy).<p>
9.62. (Such was) the practice (approved) of Allah among those who lived aforetime: No change wilt thou find in
the practice (approved) of Allah.<p>
9.64. Verily Allah has cursed the Unbelievers and prepared for them a Blazing Fire,-<p>
9.65. To dwell therein for ever: no protector will they find, nor helper.<p>
9.73. (With the result) that Allah has to punish the Hypocrites, men and women, and the Unbelievers, men and women,
and Allah turns in Mercy to the Believers, men and women: for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.<p>
9.111. Allah hath purchased of the believers their persons and their goods; for theirs (in return) is the garden
(of Paradise): they fight in His cause, and slay and are slain: a promise binding on Him in truth, through the Law,
the Gospel, and the Qur'an: and who is more faithful to his covenant than Allah. then rejoice in the bargain which
ye have concluded: that is the achievement supreme.<p>
9.123. O ye who believe! fight the unbelievers who gird you about, and let them find firmness in you:
and know that Allah is with those who fear Him.<p>
10.4. To Him will be your return- of all of you. The promise of Allah is true and sure. It is He Who beginneth the
process of creation, and repeateth it, that He may reward with justice those who believe and work righteousness; but
those who reject Him will have draughts of boiling fluids, and a penalty grievous, because they did reject Him.<p>
25.52. Therefore listen not to the Unbelievers, but strive against them with the utmost strenuousness, with the
(Qur'an).<p>
33.5. But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, and seize them,
beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war); but if they repent, and establish regular
prayers and practise regular charity, then open the way for them: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.<p>
33.28. O ye who believe! Truly the Pagans are unclean; so let them not, after this year of theirs, approach the
Sacred Mosque.<p>
33.29. Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by
Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until
they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.<p>
33.30. The Jews call 'Uzair a son of Allah, and the Christians call Christ the son of Allah. That is a saying from
their mouth; (in this) they but imitate what the unbelievers of old used to say. Allah's curse be on them: how they
are deluded away from the Truth!<p>
33.119. O ye who believe! Fear Allah and be with those who are true (in word and deed).<p>
33.123. O ye who believe! fight the unbelievers who gird you about, and let them find firmness in you: and know
that Allah is with those who fear Him.<p>
47.4. Therefore, when ye meet the Unbelievers (in fight), smite at their necks; At length, when ye have thoroughly
subdued them, bind a bond firmly (on them): thereafter (is the time for) either generosity or ransom: Until the war
lays down its burdens. Thus (are ye commanded): but if it had been Allah.s Will, He could certainly have exacted
retribution from them (Himself); but (He lets you fight) in order to test you, some with others. But those who are
slain in the Way of Allah,- He will never let their deeds be lost.<p>
48.29. Muhammad is the apostle of Allah. and those who are with him are strong against Unbelievers,
(but) compassionate amongst each other.<p>
54.39. "So taste ye My Wrath and My Warning."<p>
54.40. And We have indeed made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember: then is there any that will
receive admonition?<p>
60.4. ... there has arisen, between us and you, enmity and hatred for ever,- unless ye believe in Allah and Him alone.<p>
66.9. O Prophet! Strive hard against the Unbelievers and the Hypocrites, and be firm against them.
Their abode is Hell,- an evil refuge (indeed).<p>
72.23. "Unless I proclaim what I receive from Allah and His Messages: for any that disobey Allah and
His Messenger,- for them is Hell: they shall dwell therein for ever."<p>
98.6. Those who reject (Truth), among the People of the Book and among the Polytheists, will be in Hell-Fire, to dwell therein (for aye). They are the worst of creatures.<p>
