David - 

I just have to write something about this picture you sent.  I usually find your email jokes amusing, but this one was very off-putting. 

I can only see three interpretations of this picture.  One is that Hilary is the worst kind of traitor, involved in the mass murders/terrorism committed by these two leaders because of her "discovered" sexual relationship with them.  That's horrendous, not funny. 

Another is that she has dropped all of her morals because she is so sex starved that she couldn't care less about the atrocities committed by these two because she loves their dicks more.  That's just gross. 

Or maybe the picture is inferring that Hilary is such an undesirable person that these heinous men are the only ones who could possibly be  interested in her, because their standards are at the bottom of the shit-pot. And, look!  She's grateful, because she knows that she's lucky to have any attention at all!  Insulting. 

Why would anyone think this picture is funny?  The only reason that I can think of is because it degrades her, and to someone who obsessively hates her, that makes him feel good.  It wouldn't be funny to him if it were an unknown woman, or if it were a woman that was respected by him, such as Barbara Bush or Nancy Reagan. 

I know that the radical right wing hates Hilary with an obsessive passion.  I really don't know why.  This picture looks like it was concocted by a Rush Limbaugh wannabe for someone's right wing rant site. 

So, for the record, degradation isn't funny for me.  And, since it is usually women who are the ones being degraded, and powerful women are many times the target, it hits a sensitive note with me. 

thanks for reading.
