I work with ACFnewsource, a small nonprofit news production organization that produces stories for The Osgood File on CBS Radio. I read the Chronicle article last week talking about your group and other atheists and I'm interested in talking with you to explore a story idea for Mr. Osgood. 
 
Please let me know if you have some time available to talk with me. This week I'm here today and tomorrow but away from the office Thursday in meetings and taking a vacation day Friday to extend the long weekend. 
 
Cheers
Eva Spiegel
