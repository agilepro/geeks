M.A., Geography, U.C. Santa Barbara 
B.S., Biology, B.S., Chemistry, Valparaiso University 

Nick Matzke is a Public Information Project Director at NCSE. He has a 
double B.S. in Biology and Chemistry from Valparaiso University, and a 
Master's degree in Geography from U.C. Santa Barbara. He has a long-
standing interest in evolution in a spatial context, particularly issues 
surrounding dispersal and convergence. Before coming to NCSE, he 
conducted extensive literature surveys on the origin of carnivorous plant 
traps and bacterial flagella. In the area of evolution and earth history 
education, Nick specializes in making the scientific literature accessible and 
understandable to the public, in order to rebut antievolutionist claims about 
the evolution of biological complexity. 

During the landmark "intelligent design" case Kitzmiller v. Dover 
(http://www2.ncseweb.org/wp/?page_id=5), Nick spent a year working with 
the Plaintiffs' legal team, providing scientific advice and researching the 
creationist origins of the ID movement. This work eventually resulted in the 
discovery of the now-famous creationist drafts of the 1989 ID textbook Of 
Pandas and People. This episode was recently written up in Skeptic 
magazine http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/archives/2005/05-12-20.html

Upon the conclusion of his sojourn at NCSE, he intends to enter a Ph.D. 
program where he can work on the integration of bioinformatics, 
biogeography, and large-scale evolution.
