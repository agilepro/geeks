First for some figures. Last year, an ICM poll found 85% of Americans believe
that God created the universe. In Nigeria, 98% claimed always to have believed
in God, while nine out of 10 Indonesians said they would die for their God or
religious beliefs. Last month, a survey by the market research bureau of Ireland
found 87% of the population believe in God. Rather than rocking their faith, 19%
said tragedies such as the Asian tsunami, which killed 300,000 people, bolstered
their belief. Polls have their faults, but if the figures are even remotely
right they illustrate the prevalence of faith in the modern world.
<p>Faith has long been a puzzle for science, and it's no surprise why. By
definition, faith demands belief without a need for supporting evidence, a
concept that could not be more opposed to the principles of scientific inquiry.
In the eyes of the scientist, an absence of evidence reduces belief to a hunch.
It places the assumptions at the heart of many religions on the rockiest of
ground.
<p>So why do so many people believe? And why has belief proved so resilient as
scientific progress unravels the mysteries of plagues, floods, earthquakes and
our understanding of the universe? By injecting nuns with radioactive chemicals,
by scanning the brains of people with epilepsy and studying naughty children,
scientists are now working out why. When the evidence is pieced together, it
seems that evolution prepared what society later moulded: a brain to believe.
<p>One factor in the development of religious belief was the rapid expansion of
our brains as we emerged as a species, says Todd Murphy, a behavioural
neuroscientist at Laurentian University in Canada. As the frontal and temporal
lobes grew larger, our ability to extrapolate into the future and form memories
developed. "When this happened, we acquired some very new and dramatic
cognitive skills. For example, we could see a dead body and see ourselves in
that position one day. We could think 'That's going to be me,'" he says.
That awareness of impending death prompted questions: why are we here? What
happens when we die? Answers were needed.</p>

<p>As well as providing succour for those troubled by the existential dilemma,
religion, or at least a primitive spirituality, would have played another
important role as human societies developed. By providing contexts for a moral
code, religious beliefs encouraged bonding within groups, which in turn
bolstered the group's chances of survival, says Pascal Boyer, an anthropologist
turned psychologist at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri. Some believe
that religion was so successful in improving group survival that a tendency to
believe was positively selected for in our evolutionary history. Others maintain
that religious belief is too modern to have made any difference.
<p>"What I find more plausible is that rather than religion itself offering
any advantage in evolutionary terms, it's a byproduct of other cognitive
capacities we evolved, which did have advantages," says Boyer.
<p>Psychological tests Boyer has run on children go some way to proving our
natural tendency to believe. "If you look at three- to five-year-olds, when
they do something naughty, they have an intuition that everyone knows they've
been naughty, regardless of whether they have seen or heard what they've done.
It's a false belief, but it's good preparation for belief in an entity that is
moral and knows everything," he says. "The idea of invisible agents
with a moral dimension who are watching you is highly attention-grabbing to
us."
<p>Childish belief is one thing, but religious belief is embraced by people of
all ages and is by no means the preserve of the uneducated. According to Boyer,
the persistence of belief into adulthood is at least in part down to a
presumption. "When you're in a belief system, it's not that you stop asking
questions, it's that they become irrelevant. Why don't you ask yourself about
the existence of gravity? It's because a lot of the stuff you do every day
presupposes it and it seems to work, so where's the motivation to question
it?" he says. "In belief systems, you tend to enter this strange state
where you start thinking there must be something to it because everybody around
you is committed to it. The general question of whether it's true is
relegated."
<p>While some continue to tease out the reasons for the emergence of religion
and its persistent appeal, others are delving into the neuroscience of belief in
the hope of finding a biological basis for religious experience. As a starting
point, many studies focused on people with particular neural conditions that
made them prone to experiences so intense, they considered them to be visions of
God.
<p>At the University of California in San Diego, neuroscientist VS Ramachandran
noticed that a disproportionate number of patients - around a quarter - with a
condition called temporal lobe epilepsy reported having deeply moving religious
experiences. "They'd tell me they felt a presence or suddenly felt they got
the meaning of the whole cosmos. And these could be life-changing
experiences," says Ramachandran. The feelings always came during seizures,
even if the seizures were so mild, they could only be detected by sensitive
electroencephalograms (EEGs). Between the seizures, some patients became
preoccupied with thoughts about God.
<p>Ramachandran drew up three explanations he thought might explain why the
patients with epilepsy seemed so spiritual. First, he considered that the
upwelling of emotion caused by the seizure might simply overwhelm, and patients
made sense of it by believing that something extremely spiritual was going on.
Second, the seizure might prompt the left hemisphere to make up yarns to account
for seemingly inexplicable emotions. The ability of the brain's left hemisphere
to "confabulate" like this is well known to neuroscientists. Third, he
wondered whether seizures disrupted the function of part of the brain called the
amygdala which, among other tasks, helps us focus on what is significant while
allowing us to ignore the trivial.
<p>Ramachandran decided to test a couple of patients using what is called the
galvanic skin response. Two electrodes are used to measure tiny changes in the
skin's electrical conductivity, an indirect measure of sweating. In most people,
conductivity goes up when they are shown violent or sexual pictures, or
similarly loaded words. In the test, Ramachandran found that patients with
temporal lobe epilepsy responded very differently from others. Violent words
such as "beat" and sexual words produced not a flicker, but religious
icons and the word "God" evoked a big response.
<p>With only two patients involved in the study, Ramachandran says it is
impossible to draw any conclusions, but if the results stand up to future
testing, it might indicate that seizures in the temporal lobe strengthen certain
neural pathways connected to the amygdala, meaning we attribute significance to
the banal objects and occurrences. "If those pathways all strengthen
indiscriminately, everything and anything acquires a deep significance, and when
that happens, it starts resembling a religious experience," he says.
"And if we can selectively enhance religious sentiments, then that seems to
imply there is neural circuitry whose activity is conducive to religious belief.
It's not that we have some God module in our brains, but we may have specialised
circuits for belief."
<p>At the University of Pennsylvania, radiologist Andrew Newberg has cast a
wider net to scan the brains of people performing all manner of spiritual
activities. By injecting radioactive tracers into the veins of nuns, Buddhists
and others, he has constructed brain maps that show how different practices
affect neural processing. "What comes out is there's a complex network in
the brain and depending on what you do, it is activated in different ways,"
says Newberg. "If someone does Tibetan Buddhist mediation they'll activate
certain parts of their brain, but if you have a nun praying they'll activate
slightly different parts, with someone doing transcendental mediation activating
other areas again."
<p>Newberg uncovered the neural processing behind the religious experience of
"oneness" with the universe. Blood flow drops off in the parietal
lobe, a brain structure that helps us orient ourselves by giving us a sense of
ourselves. "We think this latter step is critical," says Newberg.
"What seems to be happening is that as you block sensory information
getting into the parietal lobe, it keeps trying to give you a sense of self, but
it no longer has the information to do so. If that happens completely, you might
get this absolute feeling of oneness."
<p>Newberg has been criticised for his investigations into the essence of
spiritual experience - the most vehement attacks coming from atheists.
"Some people want me to say whether God is there or not, but these
experiments can't answer that. If I scan a nun and she has the experience of
being in the presence of God, I can tell you what's going on in her brain, but I
can't tell you whether or not God is there," he says. Religious groups
point out that there is more to religion than extreme experiences. It is a
criticism Newberg acknowledges. "The problem is, the people who have these
experiences are so much easier to study," he says.
<p>As neuroscientists unpick the biological mechanisms behind religious
experience, others are considering what to do with the information. At
Laurentian University, Todd Murphy and Michael Persinger are developing devices
they think can stimulate parts of the brain to enhance spiritual experiences.
Others see the possibility for drugs designed to boost spirituality. Newberg
says this would be underpinning a practice that has existed for hundreds of
years with scientific understanding. "If you talk to a shamen who takes a
substance so they can enter into the spirit world, they don't think that
diminishes the experience in any way," he says.
<p>Intriguingly, many scientists, while stressing that they have set out to
explore religion rather than disprove its basis, say that no matter what they
uncover about the nature of spiritual experiences, mass religious belief will
continue. The fastest growing religions in the US are the Mormon church and
Scientology, both popular, according to Boyer largely because they are new. In
other parts of the world, more fundamentalist religions succeed because they
give a clear vision of the world.
<p>"For two centuries, there's been competition between churches and in the
free market of religion, the products get better and better as people want
different things," says Boyer. "Will science be the death of religion?
As neuroscience, it's interesting to see how brains can create very strange
states of consciousness, but in terms of threatening religion, I think it'll
have absolutely no effect."
