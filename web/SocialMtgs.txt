Hi Deanna,

We typically have two meetings a month.  The 1st Thursday is for a social meeting, and the 3rd Thursday is for a more planned meeting, 
usually with a speaker.  The social meeting is open for hosting to anyone who wants to do something they consider might be fun for others to join in on.  Chris had been running them, but she has to bow out for a while.  I'm considering showing movies or videos of interesting talks for upcoming social meetings.  You can see what we've done in the past at http://www.godlessgeeks.com/oldnews.html

I hope that you can join us at our meetings.  We usually have a lot of fun and good conversation.

godlessly,
Mark
