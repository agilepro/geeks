 
Hi Mark,
 
Sorry it took so long to get back to you.  The holiday season was pretty hectic and I'm having trouble catching up on my back work.  I'm glad to hear that your'e still interested in working with me though!  I've written up an ad proposal for you to take a look at.  Let me know what you think!
 
On your page:
http://www.godlessgeeks.com/WhyAtheism.htm
 
*In the paragraph beginning "The atheist position..." please like the word "science" to:
http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/bcn96h00
 
*Next, in the paragraph beginning "Richard Dawkins expressed..." please link the word "world" to:
http://www.lif.lp.upb.edu/node/3459
 
*Then, please add a bit of text to the paragraph beginning "Some people claim that it takes more..."  This would go in the sentence beginning "For instance, atheists..."  The new text would read as follows:
 
For instance, atheists (like most people) don’t simply believe or have faith that the sun will come up tomorrow; we conclude that it will — based on evidence and logic, and make informed decision based on it, like the decision to bring a sunbrella to the beach.
 
*And please link the word "sunbrella" to:
http://www.mjjsales.com/umbrellas_with_sunbrella_canvas.htm
 
*Finally, in the next sentence, please link the word "lightning" to:
http://ballenger.wlu.edu/furniture/
 
 
I can offer you $75 (via Paypal or check) to put this ad up this month.  I won't be around this weekend to make the payment, so if you're interested feel free to take your time, I'll be able to make the payment on Monday morning.  Thanks so much for your interest, and sorry about the delay!
 
Best wishes,
~Mackenzie

I can make payments via Paypal or check, whichever is better for you.  If you're interested I can send you the proposal.  I look forward to hearing from you.
