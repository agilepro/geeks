<TD><h2 align=center>A note about the simplified spelling in my article</h2><font size=3 face="Arial">
Languages evolve over time — in both verbal and written aspects.&nbsp; Words come and go and change.<p>
I'm an iconoclast about more than religion, and think that words like “through” and “although” should have simplified spelling, i.e. “thru” and “altho.”&nbsp; Perhaps, thru common usage, we can improve these and other words — making English a little more logical and easier to learn.&nbsp; Noah Webster transformed the American spelling of “colour” into “color;” why can't we continue the trend?<p>
There's even a UK <a href=http://www.spellingsociety.org>Spelling Society</a>, which has the aims of raising awareness of the problems caused by the irregularity of English spelling and promoting remedies to improve literacy.&nbsp; For more, see <a href=http://blog.dictionary.com/spelling/>"Why Is English Spelling So Random?"</a><p>
