<H2>Saturday, May 15, 9am-noon: Help clean Stevens Creek in Mountain View</H2>
The location is at the dead end of Central Ave. <b>(NOT Central Expwy.)</b> in Mountain View. Go to the intersection of Central Expressway and Castro - and turn away from downtown Mountain View onto Moffet Blvd. Go 0.15 miles and the next street to the right is Central Ave. Turn Right and go down 0.4 miles until it dead ends. That's where everyone is meeting.<p>
Mark and I will have our "Atheists are Friendly in Silicon Valley" shirts on so you can meet up with us. We'll spend the morning working together and then do lunch on Castro. You're encouraged to wear long pants, sturdy shoes that you don't mind getting dirty, work gloves, hat, sunglasses, sunscreen and (dust mask if you're sensitive to dust).<p> 
Come join us clean a creek. Atheists are going mainstream! If you have questions or need a ride, give me a holler.<br>
