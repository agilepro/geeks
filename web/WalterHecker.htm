<h1>Freedom from religion</h1>
Letter by Walter G. Hecker<p>

IN HIS May 17 letter, John van de Groenekan leaves me puzzled as to why one couldn't be an atheist and at the
same time believe in the Constitution, a no doubt purely manmade legal document.<p>

The framers, not all themselves convinced Christians, seem to have been guided by Jesus' own prescription to
"give God what is God's and give Caesar what is Caesar's" when they separate church and state.<p>

The Protestants who settled America were fleeing from the imposition of one religion or another in their
old-world countries.<p>

Now that they are in the majority here, their descendants feel no shame imposing their religious views onto others,
even as this practice goes against not only the Constitution but also their own scriptures, which are exceptionally
explicit.<p>

A state sanctioned day of prayer is just that: the timid beginnings of the state sponsoring religion. It forces
people who do not believe in talking snakes, etc., to contribute their tax dollars to unconvincing tenets.<p>

Our founding fathers knew that there's no such thing as freedom of religion without freedom from religion.
"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion ..."<p>

If this doesn't express freedom from religion, what would? Which religion would it be that we are not guaranteed
freedom from, my brand or yours?<p>

It looks like American Christianity is now trying to enlist the compulsive powers of the state to make their case.<p>

"It is error alone that needs the support of government. Truth can stand by itself." -- Thomas Jefferson<p>
