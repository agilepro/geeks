In this first ever television history of disbelief, Jonathan Miller goes on a journey exploring the
origins of his own lack of belief and uncovering the hidden story of atheism.<p>
<b>Part 1: Shadows of Doubt</b><br>
Jonathan Miller visits the absent Twin Towers to consider the religious implications of 9/11 and
meets Arthur Miller and the philosopher Colin McGinn. He searches for evidence of the first 'unbelievers'
in Ancient Greece and examines some of the modern theories around why people have always tended to believe
in mythology and magic.<p>
