<p class=MsoNormal><tt><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-ascii-font-family:
"Times New Roman";mso-hansi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>It has
been claimed that it wasn't Jesus, but his disciples, who created the idea of
hell. As a Jew, Jesus had no belief in hell.<br><br>

Whether Jesus actually existed is highly questionable, with no reliable historical records
proving his existence.&nbsp; For sake of argument, let's assume that he did exist.&nbsp; Since
he never wrote anything (at least that survived), the only way that we can know
what he thought is by what people wrote about what he said.&nbsp; Jesus purportedly said
a lot of things, and many of them were contradictory.&nbsp; This
makes it easier for someone to quote him to back up a particular philosophical
position.<br><br>

I did a little quick research, to determine where in the buybull hell is
mentioned.&nbsp; The Christians make it easy
at <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/"><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-font-family:"Times NewRoman"'>http://bible.gospelcom.net/</span></a>
&nbsp; Just type in "hell" and let their
computer search.&nbsp; There were 15 results,
and all were in the New Testament.&nbsp; 14
were in the gospels.&nbsp; 6 referred to
cutting off your own body parts to prevent your going to hell.&nbsp; The results are below.<br><br>

The Old Testament has no reference to hell; punishment ceased at death.&nbsp;
The New Testament creates the concept of eternal punishment.&nbsp; Jesus may love you,
but if you break his rules (and don’t say you’re sorry) you will get tortured forever.&nbsp;
Of course, if you do say that you’re truly sorry, you will get a clean slate.&nbsp; Even Hitler,
if he had confessed before he died, would get into heaven.&nbsp; See Romans
10:9-10, below.<br><br>

Also note that the Greek word "doulos" was used in the bible, and it meant "slave."&nbsp; However the
good Christian translators did not like this, so they used euphemisms such as "servant" or "handmaid."&nbsp;
With this in mind, look up "servant, beat".&nbsp; You will find that Jesus (in
Luke 12:42-48, below) supposedly recommended that a servant (slave) should be cut into
pieces, as a punishment for beating other servants (slaves) and getting drunk.&nbsp; Jesus also goes
on to tell when servants (slaves) may be beaten.&nbsp; This only makes sense if these "servants" were
actually slaves.<br><br>

Those who claim that morality comes from God (via the buybull), should take special
note of these lines from Luke.&nbsp; Also,
not once in the entire buybull is slavery condemned, and it is often condoned –
even by Jesus.<br><br>
