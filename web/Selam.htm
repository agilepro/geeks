Fossil hunters have unearthed the skeleton of a young girl
who died 3.3 million years ago, marking the first time
scientists have discovered the nearly complete remains of a
child of an ancient human ancestor.<p>The girl, who was
about 3 years old when she perished in what may have been a
flash flood, provides an unprecedented window into human
evolution, in part because she belongs to the same species
as "Lucy," one of the most famous hominid specimens in
paleontology, experts said.</p>

probably a female, was three when she died.

<p>That prompted some scientists to refer to the new
skeleton as "Lucy's baby," even though they estimate that
the child lived about 150,000 years earlier. The researchers
who discovered her in an Ethiopian desert named her Selam,
which means "peace" in several Ethiopian languages.
<p>Although scientists have found bones and bone fragments
of children from this and other species of human
predecessors, and a few skeletons, the discovery represents
one of the most complete individuals ever recovered and by
far the oldest. Bones of young children are so small and
soft that few survive.
<p>"I'm very excited," said Zeresenay Alemseged of the Max
Planck Institute in Leipzig, Germany, who led the
international team reporting the find in today's issue of
the journal Nature. "This is a unique discovery in the
history of paleoanthropology."
<p>Independent experts agreed, saying the discovery probably
would lead to important insights into humans' evolutionary history.
<p>"It's just an amazingly complete specimen," said Bernard
Wood of George Washington University, who wrote an article
accompanying the paper. "I have to keep picking up the
photograph of it to make sure I didn't dream it."
<p>Scientists are still painstakingly extracting the
fossilized bones from the surrounding stone, but they have
already made striking discoveries, dramatically reinforcing
the idea that the creatures were a transitional stage
between apes and humans. Although they had legs like humans
that enabled them to walk upright on two feet, they also had
shoulders like gorillas that may have enabled them to climb
trees; although their teeth seem to have grown quickly, like
chimps' teeth, their brains may have matured more slowly,
like those of humans.
<p>"This confirms the idea that human evolution was not some
straight line going from ape to human," said Rick Potts of
the Smithsonian Institution. "The more we discover, the more
we realize that different parts evolve at different times,
and some of these experiments of early evolution had a
combination of humanlike and apelike features."
<p>The child's species, <i>Australopithecus afarensis</i> ,
lived between about 3.8 million and 3 million years ago and
is among the earliest known forerunners of modern humans. It
has long played an important role for scientists studying
evolution, in part because of the well-preserved remains of
Lucy, an adult discovered nearby in 1974.
<p>The youngster's fossilized remains, the first to fully
exhibit the mixed ape-human characteristics in a child, were
found in the remote, harsh Dikika area of northeastern
Ethiopia in 2000 when an expedition member spotted the face
of the skull poking out from a steep dusty hillside. The
surroundings indicate that the child might have drowned in a
flash flood, which immediately buried the intact remains in
sand that hardened to encase the bones, the researchers
said.
<p>Over the next four years, researchers slowly recovered
much of the rest of the child's skeleton, including the
entire skull, with a sandstone impression of the brain, jaws
with teeth, parts of the shoulder blades and collarbone,
ribs, the spinal column, the right arm, fingers, legs and
almost a complete left foot.
<p>National Geographic magazine provided some of the funding
for the project.
<p>Until now, the only fairly complete skeletons of young
children in the human evolutionary tree found by scientists
were those of modern humans and Neanderthals, which date
back only about 60,000 years.
<p>"We've never had anything so complete before," said
Donald C. Johanson of Arizona State University, who
discovered Lucy. "This is going to allow us to have
extraordinary insight into the growth and development of
this species."
<p>Zeresenay has been painstakingly etching away the
sandstone, almost grain by grain, with a dentist's drill to
protect the tiny vertebrae, ribs and other bones. One finger
is still curled in a tiny grasp. High-tech scans of the
teeth enabled researchers to identify the child's sex and
approximate age.
<p>Where the child's throat once was, Zeresenay found a
hyoid bone, which is located in the voice box and supports
muscles of the tongue and throat. It is the first time that
bone has been discovered in such an old fossil of a human
predecessor. It appears more primitive than a human hyoid
and more like those in apes, suggesting that the 1 1/2 -foot
toddler sounded more like a chimp than a human.
<p>"If you imagine how this child would have sounded if it
was crying out for its mother, its cry would appeal more to
chimp ears than to human ears," said Fred Spoor of
University College London, who is helping to study the
remains. "Even though it's a very early human ancestor, she
would sound more apelike than humanlike."
<p>The child's lower limbs confirm earlier findings that the
species walked upright like humans. But the shoulder blades
resemble a young gorilla's. Along with the long arms, curved
fingers and inner-ear cavity, the bones provide new evidence
supporting those who believe the creatures may have still
climbed trees as well.
<p>"I see this species as foraging bipeds -- walking on two
feet but climbing trees when necessary, such as to forage
for food," Zeresenay said, adding that more research will be
needed to be certain of that controversial conclusion.
<p>The skeleton offers scientists the first opportunity to
examine various parts of the body in a single specimen
rather than looking at individual bones from different
representatives.
<p>"Before this, you didn't know if it was like you might
have the arm of a Danny DeVito and the leg of a Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar," Potts said.
<p>The discovery of a child also allows scientists to begin
to study how the species developed. The child's brain size
suggests that the species' brain matured relatively slowly.
<p>"If the brain was developing slower, as in humans or
similar to what you see in humans, here might have also been
the beginnings of behavioral shifts towards being more
human," Zeresenay said.</div>
