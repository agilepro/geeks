Mark,
I saw the Silicon Valley Atheists announcement in the SJ Mercury News
Calendar and want you to know that the Unitarian Universalist Church of
Palo Alto has a noticeable number of members who are atheists. The UUCPA
is committed to acceptance of every person's search for meaning. So
rather than espousing one belief system, we accept a variety of beliefs
and are committed to working towards building a diverse community. Your
group may find some of our activities to be of mutual interest. We
certainly support every one of your goals. In addition, we are a larger
group and can do more. 

You might also be aware of the Palo Alto Humanist Community. I believe
that most of the members are atheists although that isn't a requirement.


Regards,
Janet Buelow
