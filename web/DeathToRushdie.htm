- </span></b>Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards have renewed a call to kill
Salman Rushdie, whom Iran condemned to death 14 years ago for allegedly
insulting Islam in a prize-winning novel.
<p>The hard-line Guards, Iran's main fighting force, said in a statement
that the fatwa - or Islamic edict - issued by the late revolutionary
leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, was "irrevocable," the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported late Friday.
<p>Khomeini issued the fatwa against Rushdie on Feb. 14, 1989, ordering
Muslims to kill the novelist because he had allegedly insulted Islam in
his best-selling novel, "The Satanic Verses."
<p>In 1998, the Iranian government declared it would not support the fatwa,
but at the same time the government said it could not rescind the edict
as, under Islamic law, that could be done only by the person who issued
it. Khomeini died in June 1989.
<p>The news agency quoted the Guards as saying "Khomeini's historical
edict on Salman Rushdie is irrevocable and nothing can change it."
The Revolutionary Guards are seen to be loyal to hard-liners inside Iran's
Islamic government.
<p>Reformist and independent newspapers ignored the 14th anniversary of
the death sentence this week, while few extremist hard-line papers gave it
prominent coverage.
<p>But the hard-line Jomhuri Islami ran a 16-page supplement Saturday with
a front-page cartoon of a dead Rushdie being carried in a coffin draped
with flags of the United States, Britain and Israel, countries seen by
hard-liners as the main supporters of Rushdie's novel.
<p>Ayatollah Hassan Saneii, head of the semiofficial Khordad foundation
that has placed a $2.8 million bounty on Rushdie's head, was quoted by
Jomhuri Islami as saying that his foundation would now pay $3 million to
anyone who kills Rushdie.
<p>Khomeini's 1989 fatwa sent Rushdie into hiding under police protection,
but didn't stop him from writing more novels. In 1990, Rushdie published
an apology and reiterated his respect for Islam.
