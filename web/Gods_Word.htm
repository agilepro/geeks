When Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura dismissed religion as a "sham"
and a crutch for weak-minded people, the pundits pounced. Ridiculing Ventura,
commentators like E.J. Dionne hastened to praise religious belief and the
strong-minded leaders it produced, like Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King,
Jr. The governor's approval ratings declined; he repented and vowed to behave:
"I'm not going to offer my personal opinions on anything," Ventura
groused. <br>
<br>
Does <b>anyone</b> still believe that media elites are hostile to religion?
Ventura's categorical dismissal of religious people (the vast majority of
Americans) was refreshing precisely <b>because</b> it violated norms of
religious correctness, even though it <b>was</b> rather facile. <br>
<br>
Of course, there are intelligent strong-minded people who believe in God;
that's what makes religious belief interesting. But defenders of religion
routinely make equally thoughtless generalizations about the unmitigated
virtues of belief and the inevitable vices of disbelief; and <b>pundits nod in
pious unison.</b> <br>
<br>
Consider the <b>claptrap</b> that immediately followed last spring's mass
shootings at Columbine High School. In their rush to find reasons, commentators
and politicians <b>instantly</b> cited impiety.<br>
<br>
Presidential candidate Gary Bauer said that we shouldn't be surprised by such
violence; it is the "natural consequence" of not teaching kids about
God. <i>Weekly Standard</i> editor Fred Barnes blamed paganism. <br>
<br>
Undeterred by a lack of information about the upbringing of the two mass
murderers, Barnes suggested on the FOX News Network that if the shooters had
been schooled in Christianity and urged to read the Bible, they would not have
turned to violence. <b>The statement was stunning in its stupidity.</b><br>
<br>
You don't have to be familiar with the history of religious warfare to know
that Bible reading and belief in God sometimes sanctify horrific violence. You
only have to remember the bombing of the World Trade Center, the murders of
several abortion doctors, or the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin -- perpetrated
by Muslim, Christian, and Jewish fundamentalists, respectively, <b>who believed
they were serving God.</b> <br>
<br>
I'm not suggesting that religion causes murder and mayhem. It is, of course, a
source of virtue and benevolence as well as deadly fanaticism. I am simply
stressing the obvious point that is lost in our reflexive hosannas to godliness:
Religious faith is an exceedingly complex and variable phenomenon that affects
different people differently -- like pornography -- although pundits treat it
like a feel-good Spielberg movie. <br>
<br>
It makes little sense to talk about "religion" in the singular, John
Dewey observed. We can only talk about "religions," plural. These
days we praise America's established religions relentlessly. Pundits
predictably assert that our preoccupation with godliness reflects concern about
declining moral values and the aging of the baby boomers. We shouldn't dismiss
this analysis simply because it's banal. But religion and pop spirituality
movements have been ascendant for at least 10 to 20 years, in part because of
the approach of the year 2000, and in part because culture is like real estate
-- <b>it's cyclical.</b><br>
<br>
Whether the media lead or follow cultural trends, they rarely, if ever,
challenge them. The mass media cover religious belief faithfully, in accordance
with conventional wisdom about its virtues. Mark Silk, author of <u>Unsecular
Media</u>, observes that print coverage of religion "tends to be
softball" because "a lot of readers go to church" and, in
general, "newspapers and newsweeklies are not in the business of offending
their readers." <br>
<br>
Coverage of religion has increased significantly in the past four or five
years, partly in response to criticism of the press for neglecting it.
According to the Religious Newswriters Association, over 400 reporters are
assigned to the religion beat at secular newspapers and magazines. ABC, CBS,
NBC, PBS, and NPR employ religion reporters. <br>
<br>
In 1998, some 65 American journalists seeking enlightenment or maybe redemption
journeyed to Rome to hear the pope at a conference entitled Media and Religion
2000. "I came out of the conference convinced we have to do a better job
of helping our readers in their spiritual search," Tim McGuire, editor of
the <i>Minneapolis Star Tribune</i>, reported.<br>
<br>
The focus on increased coverage of religion seems reflective, in part, of the
drive to provide readers with news they can use. "Religion is one of the
favorite cover subjects of <i>Time</i>, <i>Newsweek</i>, and <i>U.S. News and
World Report</i>," a 1999 survey by Fairness &amp; Accuracy in Reporting
(FAIR) attested. (Reporting on the religion and media conference, McGuire noted
that newsmagazines "have found they really connect with audiences"
when they offer stories that address the "what's it all about"
questions.) <br>
<br>
In its review of national newsweeklies, FAIR did not find the hostility toward
religion of which conservative critics complain; instead it detected "<b>an
element of pandering</b> . . . in the newsweekly's frequent return to cover
stories like Time's 'The Search for Jesus' and U.S. News' 'In Search of
Jesus.'"<br>
<br>
Often religious topics are handled with kid gloves to avoid offending the
believers who are likely to buy such issues at the newsstands. Perhaps that's
why Time's 'Does Heaven Exist?' cover article (3/24/97) doesn't include a
single source who says <b>no</b>."<br>
<br>
I've been following media coverage of religion for the past several years, and
FAIR's report was no surprise to me. Reading mass market national magazines --
women's magazines as well as the newsweeklies -- or watching TV, you find
generally uncritical, unquestioning stories about the efficacy of prayer, the
existence of angels, the resurgent spirituality of baby boomers (and its
attendant virtues), the likelihood that at least some Bible stories are true,
and the marriage of science and religion ("Science Finds God," <i>Newsweek</i>
trumpeted in a 1998 cover story).<br>
<br>
You'll find many similarly unskeptical stories about faith healing, various
psychic phenomena, or communications with the dead. What you won't find is an
equivalent number of articles promoting atheism or, at least, presenting it
sympathetically. <br>
<br>
My own unscientific Internet search for magazines and newspapers (in 1998 and
1999) yielded only a handful of uncritical stories about atheism or secular
humanism. These included the occasional op-ed piece in defense of godlessness,
by a beleaguered atheist or agnostic. <br>
<br>
My own experience writing and speaking critically or irreverently about
religious faith has only confirmed my belief that the mainstream media are
unduly fearful of offending the faithful. Individual members of the clergy or
religious institutions do sometimes come under attack, especially when they're
exposed as hypocrites. <b>But traditional religious beliefs are sacrosanct.</b><br>
<br>
In deference to them, a 1996 op-ed piece that I wrote for the <i>New York Times</i>
in 1994 on New Age practices was purged by an editor of any expressions of
irreverence toward established religion. I had been invited to write
disparagingly about Hillary Clinton's interest in New Age and her imaginary
conversations with Eleanor Roosevelt, but had been warned against even
mentioning established religious beliefs. So when I observed that Hillary's
conversations with Eleanor didn't seem particularly weird when you considered
that millions of Americans regularly talk to Jesus (who's been dead a lot
longer than Mrs. Roosevelt), I was chastised for being "offensive."<br>
<br>
You can't say <b>that</b> -- we'd get angry letters, my editor explained.
Letters to the <i>Times</i>, however, are <b>also</b> subject to rules against
irreverence, a recent item in <i>The Nation</i> by Daniel Radosh suggests. <br>
<br>
On October 25 of this year, the <i>Times </i>published a letter from Radosh
responding to attacks on the Harry Potter books. His published letter observed
that the Bible contains much material that some would consider harmful to
children. <br>
<br>
It did not, however, include a reference to biblical "sorcery,"
because that was excised by anxious editors: "The entire affair is
presided over by an all-powerful magical being," Radosh's original letter
observed. The editors also cut a flip suggestion that we might "owe it to
the kids" to ban the Bible. These editorial changes "were not for
length or clarity," Radosh remarks. <br>
<br>
"Rather the editors felt that the readers might 'misunderstand' my point,
even after I assured them that I meant to say precisely what they were afraid
people might think I was saying." It's not clear to me why you need to be
afraid of saying anything if you're the <i>New York Times</i>. I suspect that
my editor and Radosh's editors were simply reacting reflexively, not in fear
but out of unthinking respect for social norms. <br>
<br>
Irreverence, let alone criticism directed at established Western religions, is
dismissed by the moderates who dominate the media as gratuitously rude or
offensive; like racist speech, it's not considered part of civil discourse.
Many adhere to the usually (but not always) unspoken rule that "people
shouldn't criticize religion." <br>
<br>
Others explain that faith is "a private matter." <b>Tell that to the
women in Afghanistan.</b> I'm not arguing that the media should make a practice
of attacking religious beliefs as mindlessly as it promotes them, airing the
invectives of militant atheists along with the pieties of believers. <br>
<br>
I <b>am</b> suggesting that "nothing sacred" is a good motto for
critics and journalists. It doesn't imply cynicism or nihilism, but rather a
purposeful skepticism -- a willingness to interrogate our most passionate
beliefs and assumptions. Religions exert immense social and political power; <b>how
can we abdicate our responsibility to critique them?</b> Religions are
collections of ideas about God, and ideas should be subject to hazing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
