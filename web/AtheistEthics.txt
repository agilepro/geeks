ATHEIST ETHICS IN 200 WORDS

Purpose is ours to choose.

There is a natural "default" purpose, which we may choose if we like. 
We all have parents, as did they, back to the beginning of life. 
Every one of our ancestors had children. Health is the ability to 
survive; the goal favored by natural selection is "promote the health 
of your family." We are all members of Darwin's family, all kin from 
the beginning of life.

The Good is that which leads to health, The Right is that which leads 
to peace. If you want to maintain peaceful and cooperative relations 
with your neighbors, don't kill, steal, lie, or break agreements. As 
Shakespeare wrote, "It needs no ghost, Milord, come from the grave, 
to tell us this." If you value anything, value other humans, for they 
are the only help you will have in times of trouble.

Meaning is the story we choose to join. Instead of seeking a ticket 
to Heaven by being obedient on Earth, we can gain meaning by seeking 
to make this Earth a better place, for ourselves and our posterity.

This wondrous Universe is more than enough. We have loved the stars 
too fondly to be fearful of the night.

=====================================

C. Canem asks; by what standard do atheists judge what is good or evil?

Like other animals, we're genetically predisposed to insure our own  
survival and the survival of our species.  It's in our selfish  
best interest to cooperate with others to insure our immediate  
wellbeing and the well being of our progeny.

There is evidence to support the fact that humans and other animals  
as well I might add are genetically programmed for empathy.   
Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of  
another.

Without religion to tell us what to do and give us a clean slate  
when we don't do it, without the threat of the loss of heaven or  
the pain of hell, we must take responsibility for our behaviors in  
the here and now, and no excuses.

So, in addition to being motivated by survival, empathy, and  
personal responsibility, we have to live with ourselves, and feel  
good about who we are.

Religions, on the other hand, offer a morality supposedly superior  
to common decency.  They promote aggression in support of their  
self righteous notions about whose side God is on.

So there you have it.
