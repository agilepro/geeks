<h3>Sunday June 12, 11 am: Surviving and Thriving - A Path to Joy and Understanding<br>- at <a href=http://www.humanists.org>The Humanist Community</a> in Palo Alto</H3>How does the human mind behave and operate? How does this planet Earth move and change, and how does life on earth, and human kind, grow and change within it? What is the role and purpose of humans within this world, as observed in our practice and behavior? How are we affecting our life support systems globally, and what are the vital actions we must take and the most important problems must we solve, to survive and thrive as a civilized species into the forseeable future? Humanist Community member Martin Squibbs will propose some answers to these questions.<p>Buffet lunch at noon.<p><b>Location:</b><br><a href=http://www.google.com/maphp?q=40+Embarcadero+Road,+94301>Palo Alto High School</a><br>50 Embarcadero Rd<br>Palo Alto
