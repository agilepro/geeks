Hi Skip,

This year, our group will again lead a protest against the National Day of Prayer event, in San Jose on May 1.  Last year, I talked to many high school kids who were brainwashed with creationism (along with a bunch of other ideas).  However they were typically at least open to discussing evolution.  So I would spend a couple of minutes with each one, get them to agree that that's not enough time, then give them one of NCSE's brochures on evolution.

Our supply is starting to run low.  What brochures do you suggest we get, and how do we get them?

Thanks,
Mark Thomas, president of Atheists of Silicon Valley
