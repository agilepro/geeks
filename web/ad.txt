Tall, Trim, 'Telligent & 'Tractive   
  
We're all looking for someone, and I'm no different.
I'm looking for a friend, lover, and soulmate. That great philosopher Mick Jagger once said, "I can't get no satisfaction." That may be true, but I think we can get fulfillment.
Compatibility -- there's the rub!
I'm 54, 6'3", 205, physically fit, with light brown hair and blue eyes, intelligent, attractive, independent, adventurous, healthy, passionate, loving, funny, curious, creative, politically a liberal and philosophically a freethinker. I love big dogs (I have one), little kids (I have none -- little or big), hang gliding, reading, skiing, hiking, personal growth, racquetball, Yoga, adventure, travel, nature, cooking (especially Chinese meals), camping and cuddling (among many other things). 
 
Looking For: Women for Discreet Relationship or 1-on-1 sex 
 
Ideal Person: All I want is for you to be intelligent, happy, healthy, creative, humorous, affectionate, attractive, passionate, communicative, physically fit, self assured, not religious, sane enough to know when to be crazy.

Maybe I'm asking for too much, but it's my dream and that's what I want. What do you want?



=====================================================



Hello,

Not all the good men are taken.

I'm 6'3", 202, physically fit with light brown hair and blue eyes, intelligent, attractive, independent, adventurous, healthy, passionate, loving, funny, curious, creative, politically a liberal and philosophically a freethinker.  I love big dogs (I have one), reading, Yoga, hang gliding, skiing, hiking, personal growth, racquetball, adventure, travel, nature, cooking (especially Chinese meals), massage, mangoes, camping and cuddling (among many other things).

If we like each other, I'm sure that another love would be making you happy, too.

You should be in your 30's to early 50's, intelligent, happy, attractive, healthy, creative, humorous, affectionate, passionate, communicative, physically fit, self assured, not religious, and sane enough to know when to be a little crazy.

Your pic gets mine.


Take care.
