<p>A Muslim extremist group threatened to behead
female TV broadcasters if they don't don strict
Islamic dress, leaving the women terrified and
marking a further downward spiral in Gaza's anarchy.

<p><br>The threat to "cut throats from vein to vein" was
delivered by the Swords of Truth, a fanatical group that
has previously claimed responsibility for bombing Internet cafes and music shops.

<p><br>The new threat was the first time the
organization targeted a specific group of people,
and adds to a growing climate of extremism, fear and
suspicion in Gaza.

<p><br>In many parts of the Muslim world, religious
conservative policies keep women out of TV anchoring
positions or only let them take the jobs if they
wear headscarves. But in some countries scarves are
uncommon, like Lebanon and Jordan, and Egypt even
keeps newscasters who wear them off its TV stations.

<p><br>Most of the 15 women broadcasters on
government-run Palestine TV wear headscarves. But
they also wear makeup and Western clothing, which is
not considered strictly observant by the extremists.

<p><br>The Swords of Truth issued the statement Friday
in an e-mail sent to news organizations. "We will
cut throats, and from vein to vein, if needed to
protect the spirit and moral of this nation." </p>

<p><br>The group accused the broadcasters of being
"without any...shame or morals" and said it knew
where to find the women.

<p><br>Prior to the statement, some women broadcasters
said they had received personal threats through
their mobile phones. It was not clear if those
threats were from the same group.

<p><br>One anchorwoman who does not wear a headscarf
said she was too frightened by the threat to go to
work on Saturday.

<p><br>"It's a dangerous precedent in our society. It
will target all working women," said the
broadcaster, who declined to give her name out of fear. "The
statement frightened us."

<p><br>Another presenter who wears a headscarf, on
Palestine TV, said she couldn't understand why they
were targeted. "I hope they take it back. I hope not
a bullet will be fired at us," she said.

<p><br>Basem Abu Sumaya, head of the Palestinian
Broadcasting Corporation, which runs Palestine TV,
said that the PBC already had security measures in
place, but could not protect people on the way to work.

<p><br>The PBC is bankrolled by Palestinian Authority
President Mahmoud Abbas and is accused of openly
exhibiting support for the Fatah movement.

<p><br>A senior security official, who requested
anonymity owing to the issue's sensitivity, said The
Swords of Truth had less than 100 members, and was
formed last year.

<p><br>The group claimed responsibility for the bombings
since October of about three dozen Internet cafes,
music shops and pool halls, which are considered
places of vice by some in deeply conservative Gaza.

<p><br>Assailants detonated small bombs outside
businesses at night, causing damage but no injuries.

<p><br>The security official said his forces were taking
the threat seriously. He said Hamas members
funded the group, wanting to impose a
hardline version of Islam in Gaza. Hamas
spokesman Ismail Ridwan said his faction had "no
relation" to the group.

<p><br>This is not the first display of recent
Islamic extremism in Gaza.&nbsp; Only last month,
Muslim hardliners lobbed a bomb at a UN-run
school, accusing the world body of "turning
schools into nightclubs" for holding a display of
traditional Palestinian dancing.</td>
