<h2>&nbsp; &nbsp; Genesis</h2>

1. God likes Abel's dead animals better than Cain's fruits and
vegetables. Why? Well, no reason is given, but it probably has
something to do with the amount of pain, blood, and gore involved.
4:3-5<p>

2. Because God liked Abel's animal sacrifice more than Cain's
vegetables, Cain kills his brother Abel in a fit of religious
jealousy. 4:8<p>

3. God is angry. He decides to destroy all humans, beasts, creeping
things, fowls, and "all flesh wherein there is breath of life." He
plans to drown them all. 6:7, 17<p>

4. God repeats his intention to kill "every living substance ...
from off the face of the earth." But why does God kill all the
innocent animals? What had they done to deserve his wrath? It seems
God never gets his fill of tormenting animals. 7:4<p>

5. God drowns everything that breathes air. From newborn babies to
koala bears -- all creatures great and small, the Lord God drowned
them all. 7:21-23<p>

6. Noah kills the "clean beasts" and burns their dead bodies for
God. According to 7:8 this would have caused the extinction of all
"clean" animals since only two of each were taken onto the ark. "And
the Lord smelled a sweet savor." 8:20<p>

7. To free Lot from captivity, Abram sends an army of slaves to
pursue and smite his captors. 14:14-15<p>

8. God tells Abram to kill some animals for him. The needless
slaughter makes God feel better. 15:9-10<p>

9. Hagar conceives, making Sarai jealous. Abram tells Sarai to do
to Hagar whatever she wants. "And when Sarai dealt hardly with her,
she fled." 16:6<p>

10. Lot refuses to give up his angels to the perverted mob, offering
his two "virgin daughters" instead. He tells the bunch of angel rapers
to "do unto them [his daughters] as is good in your eyes." This is the
same man that is called "just" and "righteous" in 2 Pet.2:7-8. 19:7-8<p>

11. God kills everyone (men, women, children, infants, newborns) in
Sodom and Gomorrah by raining "fire and brimstone from the Lord out of
heaven." Well, almost everyone -- he spares the "just and righteous"
Lot and his family. 19:24<p>

12. God threatens to kill Abimelech and his people for believing
Abe's lie. 20:3-7<p>

13. God orders Abraham to kill Isaac as a burnt offering. Abraham
shows his love for God by his willingness to murder his son. But
finally, just before Isaac's throat is slit, God provides a goat to
kill instead. 22:2-13<p>

14. Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, is "defiled" by a man who seems to
love her dearly. Her brothers trick all of the men of the town and
kill them (after first having them all circumcised), and then take
their wives and children captive. 34:1-31<p>

15. "The terror of God was upon the cities that were round about
them." I don't know what the "terror of God" is, but I'll bet it
isn't pleasant. 35:5<p>

16. "And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord;
and the Lord slew him." What did Er do to elicit God's wrath? The
Bible doesn't say. Maybe he picked up some sticks on Saturday. 38:7<p>

17. After God killed Er, Judah tells Onan to "go in unto they
brother's wife." But "Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and
... when he went in unto his brother's wife ... he spilled it on the
ground.... And the thing which he did displeased the Lord; wherefore
he slew him also." This lovely Bible story is seldom read in Sunday
School, but it is the basis of many Christian doctrines, including the
condemnation of both masturbation and birth control. 38:8-10<p>

18. After Judah pays Tamar for her services, he is told that she
"played the harlot" and "is with child by whoredom." When Judah hears
this, he says, "Bring her forth, and let her be burnt." 38:24<p>

19. Joseph interprets the baker's dream. He says that the pharaoh
will cut off the baker's head, and hang his headless body on a tree
for the birds to eat. 40:19<p>

<h2>&nbsp; &nbsp; Exodus</h2>

20. Moses murders an Egyptian after making sure that no one is looking.
2:11-12<p>

21. God threatens to kill the Pharaoh's firstborn son. 4:23<p>

22. God decides to kill Moses because his son had not yet been
circumcised. 4:24-26<p>

23. God will make sure that Pharaoh does not listen to Moses, so
that he can kill Egyptians with his armies. 7:4<p>

24. "And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD." Who else
could be so cruel and unjust? 7:5, 17<p>

25. God tells Moses and Aaron to smite the river and turn it into
blood. 7:17-24<p>

26. The fifth plague: all cattle in Egypt die. 9:2-6<p>

27. The sixth plague: boils and blains upon man and beast. 9:9-12<p>

28. "For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart,
and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that
there is none like me in all the earth." Who else but the biblical god
could be so cruel? 9:14<p>

29. God kills all Egyptian cattle with hail. 9:19-20<p>

30. The seventh plague is hail. "And the hail smote throughout the
land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast." 9:22-25<p>

31. These verses clearly show that the mass murder of innocent
children by God was premeditated. 11:4-6 (see 12:29-30)<p>

32. God will kill the Egyptian children to show that he puts "a
difference between the Egyptians and Israel." 11:7<p>

33. God explains to Moses that he intends to "smite all the
firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast. 12:12<p>

34. After God has sufficiently hardened the Pharaoh's heart, he
kills all the firstborn Egyptian children. When he was finished "there
was not a house where there was not one dead." Finally, he runs out of
little babies to kill, so he slaughters the firstborn cattle, too. 12:29<p>

35. To commemorate the divine massacre of the Egyptian children,
Moses instructs the Israelites to "sacrifice to the Lord all that
openeth the matrix" -- all the males, that is. God has no use for
dead, burnt female bodies. 13:2, 12, 15<p>

36. After hardening Pharaoh's heart a few more times, God drowns
Pharaoh's army in the sea 14:4-28<p>

37. Moses and the people sing praises to their murderous god. 15:1-19<p>

38. "The Lord is a man of war." Indeed, judging from his acts in the
Old Testament, he is a vicious warlike monster. 15:3<p>

39. God's right hand dashes people in pieces. 15:6<p>

40. Joshua, with God's approval, kills the Amalekites "with the edge
of the sword." 17:13<p>

41. "The Lord has sworn [God swears!] that the Lord will have war
with Amalek from generation to generation." 17:14-16<p>

42. Any person or animal that touches Mt. Sinai shall be stoned to
death or "shot through." 19:12-13<p>

43. God gives instructions for killing and burning animals. He says
that if we will make such "burnt offerings," he will bless us for it.
What kind of mind would be pleased by the killing and burning of
innocent animals? 20:24<p>

44. A child who hits or curses his parents must be executed. 21:15,17<p>

45. An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. 21:24-25<p>

46. If an ox gores someone, then both the ox and its owner must die.
21:28-29<p>

47. "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live." Thousands of innocent
women have suffered excruciating deaths because of this verse. 22:18<p>

48. "Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death." Is
it really necessary to kill such people? Couldn't we just send them to
counseling or something? 22:19<p>

49. "He who sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the Lord only, he
shall be utterly destroyed." If this commandment is obeyed, then the
four billion people who do not believe in the biblical god must be
killed. 22:20<p>

50. If you make God angry enough, he will kill you and your family
with his own sword. 22:24<p>

51. "The firstborn of thy sons thou shalt give unto me." (As a burnt
offering?) 22:29<p>

52. God promises to "send his fear before the Israelites" and to
kill everyone that they encounter when they enter the promised land. 23:27<p>

53. Moses has some animals killed and their dead bodies burned for
God. Then he sprinkles their blood on the altar and on the people.
This makes God happy. 24:5-8<p>

54. Get some animals, kill them, chop up their bodies, wave body
parts in the air, burn the carcasses, and sprinkle the blood all
around -- in precisely the way God tells you. It may well make you
sick, but it makes God feel good. 29:11-37<p>

55. Have your killed and offered your bullock for a sin offering
today? How about the two lambs you are supposed to offer each day?
29:36-39<p>

56. Wash up or die. 30:20-21<p>

57. Whoever puts holy oil on a stranger shall be "cut off from his
people." 30:33<p>

58. Those who break the Sabbath are to be executed. 31:14<p>

59. God asks to be left alone so that his "wrath may wax hot" and he
can "consume them. 32:10<p>

60. God orders the sons of Levi (Moses, Aaron, and the other members
of their tribe that were "on the Lord's side") to kill "every man his
neighbor." "And there fell of the people that day about 3000 men." 32:27-28<p>

61. But God wasn't satisfied with the slaughter of the 3000, so he
killed some more people with a plague. 32:35<p>

62. If you can't redeem him, then just "break his neck." Hey, it's
all for the glory of God. 34:20<p>

63. Whoever works, or even kindles a fire, on the Sabbath "shall be
put to death." 35:2-3<p>

<h2>&nbsp; &nbsp; Leviticus</h2>

64. God gives detailed instructions for performing ritualistic
animal sacrifices. such bloody rituals must be important to God,
judging from the number of times that he repeats their instructions.
Indeed the entire first nine chapters of Leviticus can be summarized
as follows: Get an animal, kill it, sprinkle the blood around, cut the
dead animal into pieces, and burn it for a "sweet savor unto the
Lord." Chapters 1 - 9<p>

65. Wringing off the heads of pigeons for God. 5:8-9<p>

66. The holy law of trespass offering: Find an animal; kill it;
sprinkle the blood around; offer God the fat, rump, kidneys, and caul;
burn and eat it in the holy place, for "it is most holy." 7:1-6<p>

67. The priest must sprinkle the blood of the peace offerings. 7:14<p>

68. Be careful what you eat during these animal sacrifices. Don't
eat fat or blood -- these are for God. (And he doesn't like to share!) 7:18-27<p>

69. God gives instructions for "wave offerings" and "heave
offerings." He says these offerings are to be made perpetually "by a
statute for ever." Have you made your heave offering today? 7:30-36<p>

70. Moses does it all for God. First he kills an animal; wipes the
blood on Aaron's ears, thumbs, and big toes. Then he sprinkles blood
round about and waves the guts before the Lord. Finally he burns the
whole mess for "a sweet savour before the Lord." 8:14-32<p>

71. More killing, sprinkling of blood, waiving animal parts, and
burning carcasses "before the Lord." 9:8-21<p>

72. Two of the sons of Aaron "offered strange fire before the Lord"
and "there went out fire from the Lord, and devoured them, and they
died before the Lord." 10:1-2<p>

73. If priests misbehave at the tabernacle by uncovering their
heads, tearing their clothes, leaving with holy oil on them, or by
drinking "wine or strong drink", then God will kill them and send his
wrath on "all the people." 10:6-9<p>

74. God's treatment for leprosy: Get two birds. Kill one. Dip the
live bird in the blood of the dead one. Sprinkle the blood on the
leper seven times, and then let the blood-soaked bird fly off. Next
find a lamb and kill it. Wipe some of its blood on the patient's right
ear, thumb, and big toe. Sprinkle seven times with oil and wipe some
of the oil on his right ear, thumb and big toe. Repeat. Finally kill a
couple doves and offer one for a sin offering and the other for a
burnt offering. 14:2-32<p>

75. God explains the use of scapegoats. It goes like this: Get two
goats. Kill one. Wipe, smear, and sprinkle the blood around seven
times. Then take the other goat, give it the sins of all the people,
and send it off into the wilderness. 16:6-28<p>

76. If you upset God, he'll cause the land to vomit you out. 18:25<p>

77. "Whosoever shall commit any of these abominations ... shall be
cut off from among their people." I'm not sure what being "cut off"
means exactly, but I bet it isn't any fun. 18:29, 19:8<p>

78. Kill anyone who "gives his seed" to Molech. If you refuse, God
will cut you and your family off. 20:2-5<p>

79. "For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall
surely be put to death." Couldn't we try spanking first? 20:9<p>

80. Both parties in adultery shall be executed. 20:10<p>

81. "And the man that lieth with his father's wife ... both of them
shall be put to death." Which? The man and his father? The father and
his wife? Or the man and his father's wife? Oh heck, just kill all
three. 20:11<p>

82. If a man "lies" with his daughter-in-law, then both must be
killed. 20:12<p>

83. Homosexuals must be executed. 20:13<p>

84. If you "lie" with your wife and your mother-in-law (now that
sounds fun!), then all three of you must be burned to death. 20:14<p>

85. If a man or woman "lie with a beast" both the person and the
poor animal are to be killed. 20:15-16<p>

86. People with "familiar spirits" (witches, fortune tellers, etc.)
are to be stoned to death. 20:27<p>

87. A priest's daughter who "plays the whore" is to be burned to death. 21:9<p>

88. God gives us more instructions on killing and burning animals. I
guess the first nine chapters of Leviticus wasn't enough. He says we
must do this because he really likes the smell -- it is "a sweet
savour unto the Lord." 23:12-14, 18<p>

89. Don't do any work on the day of atonement or God will destroy
you. 23:29-30<p>

90. A man curses and blasphemes while disputing with another man.
Moses asks God what to do about it. God says that the whole community
must stone him to death. "And the children of Israel did as the Lord
and Moses commanded." 24:10-23<p>

91. Anyone who blasphemes or curses shall be stoned to death by the
entire community. 24:16<p>

92. God tells the Israelites to "chase" their enemies and make them
"fall before you by the sword." He figures five of the Israelites will
be able to "chase" a hundred of their enemies, and a hundred will be
able to "put ten thousand to flight." 26:7-8<p>

93. God describes torments that he has planned for those who
displease him. The usual stuff: plagues, burning fevers that will
consume the eyes, etc. but he reserves the worst for the little
children. He says "ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies
shall eat it", "I will send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you
of your children", and "ye shall eat the flesh of your sons ..
daughters." 26:16-39<p>

94. All "devoted" things (both man and beast) "shall surely be put
to death." 27:28-29<p>

<h2>&nbsp; &nbsp; Numbers</h2>

95. God displays his hospitality with the admonition: "The stranger
that cometh nigh shall be put to death." 1:51<p>

96. Two of Aaron's sons are killed by God for "offering strange fire
before the Lord." 3:4<p>

97. God repeats his order (see 1:51) to kill any strangers who
happen to come near. 3:10<p>

98. Once again (see 1:51 and 3:10) God tells his favorite people to
kill any strangers that come near. 3:38<p>

99. Don't touch or "go in to see when the holy things are covered."
God kills people who touch or look at uncovered holy things. 4:15, 4:20<p>

100. "And when the people complained, it displeased the Lord: and the
Lord heard it." (He had his hearing aid on.) He then burns the
complainers alive. That'll teach them. 11:1<p>

101. "And wile the flesh [of the quails] was yet between their teeth,
ere it was chewed, the wrath of the Lord was kindled against the
people, and the Lord smote the people with a very great plague. "The
Bible isn't too clear about what these poor folks did to upset God so
much; all it says is that they had "lusted." 11:33<p>

102. More plagues and pestilence sent by God. God repeats one of his
favorite promises: "your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness."
14:12, 29, 14:32-37<p>

103. God gives more instructions for the ritualistic killing of
animals. The smell of burning flesh is "a sweet savour unto the Lord."
15:3, 13-14, 24<p>

104. The Israelites find a man picking up sticks on the sabbath. God
commands them to kill him by throwing rocks at him. 15:32-36<p>

105. Because of a dispute between Korah and Moses, God makes the
ground open up and it swallows Korah and his family. And then, just
for the hell of it, God has a fire burn 250 men (friends of Korah?) to
death. 16:20-49<p>

106. After God killed Korah, his family, and 250 innocent bystanders,
the people complained saying, "ye have killed the people of the Lord."
So God, who doesn't take kindly to criticism, sends a plague on the
people. And "they that died in the plague were 14,700." 16:41-50<p>

107. God threatens to kill those who murmur. To which the people
reply, "Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish .... Shall we be
consumed with dying?" 17:12-13<p>

108. According to this verse, it is wise to stay away from holy
things and places -- like churches. God will kill you if you get too
close. 18:3<p>

109. God shows us how to make new friends by saying : "The stranger
that cometh nigh shall be put to death." 18:7<p>

110. God describes once again the procedure for ritualistic animal
sacrifices. such rituals must be extremely important to God, since he
makes their performance a "statute" and "covenant" forever. Why, then
don't Bible-believers perform these sacrifices anymore? Don't they
realize how God must miss the "sweet savour" of burning flesh? Don't
they believe God when he says "forever"? 18:17-19<p>

111. Don't get near holy things or "pollute" them. If you do, God
will kill you. 18:22, 32<p>

112. The purification of the unclean. These absurd rituals, cruel
sacrifices, and unjust punishments are vitally important to God. He
even insists that they are to be "a perpetual statute" to all
humankind. 19:1-22<p>

113. "And the Lord hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up
the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities."
This verse demonstrates the power of prayer: If you ask God, he will
destroy entire cities for you. 21:3<p>

114. God sends "fiery serpents" to bite his chosen people, and many
of them die. 21:6<p>

115. God delivers the Amorites into Moses' hands. (You're in God
hands with Moses.) So Moses does the usual thing, killing everyone
"until their was none left alive." 21:34-35<p>

116. God's people will kill like a lion and then "drink the blood of
the slain." 23:24<p>

117. God, who is as strong as a unicorn, will eat up the nations,
break their bones, and then pierce them through with his arrows. What
a guy! 24:8<p>

118. After the people "commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab,"
Moses has them all killed. Then God tells Moses to hang their dead
bodies up in front of him; God says that this will satisfy him. 25:1-5<p>

119. When one of the Israelite men brings home a foreign woman,
"Phinehas (Aaron's grandson) sees them and throws a spear "through the
man .. and the woman through her belly." This act pleases God so much
that "the plague was stayed from the children of Israel." But not
before 24,000 had died. 25:6-9<p>

120. God tells Moses how to care for his neighbors by saying: "Vex
the Midianites, and smite them." 25:16-17<p>

121. The ground swallow Korah and his companions and a fire consumes
250 men. 26:10<p>

122. "And Nadab and Abihu died when they offered strange fire before
the Lord." When you go camping avoid making any unusual fires. 26:61<p>

123. In these chapters, God provides ridiculously detailed
instructions for the ritualistic sacrifice of animals. The burning of
their dead bodies smells great to God. Eleven times in these two
chapters God says that they are to him a "sweet savour."<p>

124. Under God's direction, Moses' army defeats the Midianites. They
kill all the adult males, but take the women and children captive.
When Moses learns that they left some live, he angrily says: "Have you
saved all the women alive? Kill every male among the little ones, and
kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. But all the
women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep
alive for yourselves." So they went back and did as Moses (and
presumably God) instructed, killing everyone except for the virgins.
In this way they got 32,000 virgins -- Wow! [Even God gets some of the
booty -- including the virgins. (31:28-29)] 31:1-54 28-29<p>

125. God killed all the Egyptian firstborn. 33:4<p>

126. "The revenger of blood" must murder the murderer just as soon as
he sees him. 35:19, 21<p>

127. When a murder is committed the blood pollutes the land. The only
way to cleanse it is to spill more blood by killing the killer. 35:33<p>
