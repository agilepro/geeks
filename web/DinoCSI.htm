<p><b>HELL CREEK FORMATION, Montana</b> (CNN) -- In a desolate
landscape, under a hot sun, college students are on their hands
and knees poking and brushing away at the ground. They are here
to solve a mystery buried for 65 million years, trapped in rock
and layers of sediment. They are dinosaur detectives.</p>

<p>"This dinosaur is stuck in with plants, it's all strewn
about. And how it's strewn really tells a story about this
dinosaur" said Museum of the Rockies crew chief Nels Peterson.
<p>Peterson, along with research students Gina Sorrentino and
Luke Padgett, came to eastern Montana for the summer under the
direction of the Museum of the Rockies curator of paleontology,
John "Jack" Horner, to find dinosaur bones that help
paleontologists understand how diet and behaviors changed over a
dinosaur's lifetime.
<p>Horner and his detectives look for multiple specimens of the
same dinosaur -- from babies to adults. Over the years he's
collected the life history of Triceratops and is working on the
life history of the king himself, Tyrannosaurus rex. (<a href="javascript:cnnVideo('play','/video/tech/2006/08/24/mihelich.dino.detectives.trex.cnn','2006/08/31');">Watch

<p>"You don't want to set your mind to find too many things
because as soon as you set your mind to find something, you're
probably going to overlook something," Horner said.
<p>That's an open-minded approach that's helped him find the
first dinosaur embryos and the duck-billed plant-eater he named
Maiasaura.

<h3>Right age rock</h3>
<p>Even though dinosaurs lived all over the world, their
fossilized remains can only be found in places where the right
age rock is exposed at the surface of the ground. In the United
States that includes parts of Utah, Wyoming and Montana.
<p>"You wouldn't walk into a wheat field expecting to find a
dinosaur," Horner said. (<a href="javascript:cnnVideo('play','/video/tech/2006/08/24/horner.finding.dinosaur.bones.affl','2006/08/31');">Watch

<p>Take Michigan, for example. Even though Michigan had
dinosaurs at one time, the right age rock isn't there anymore.
The rocks exposed to the ground are 300 million years old -- too
old for dinosaurs.
<p>Dinosaurs lived between 235 million years to about 65 million
years ago. Fossils are found in places where sand and silt built
up around their remains and then turned to rock -- preserving
the bones.
<p>Sixty-five million years ago, the Hell Creek Formation was a
subtropical paradise where dinosaurs lived and died. Today it's
a badland where erosion occurs faster than plants can grow.
Strong winds pick the landscape clean, leaving behind bits and
pieces of the past.
<p>"You walk around and look for bone sticking out of the
ground. It's easy to just find bone laying on the ground out
here," Peterson said.
<p>Peterson and his crew usually spend 10 hours a day out in the
field doing hard physical labor in an unforgiving environment.
Daily temperatures soar over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The hills
are steep and slippery, and there are rattlesnakes lurking
about.
<p>Still, nobody complains -- they are all eager volunteers.
<h3>Bones vs. rocks</h3>
<p>"It's really exciting to find that first corner, or that
first little edge of bone," said Sorrentino, a graduate student
at Stony Brook University. "It's not like 'Jurassic Park' where
they are digging up perfectly articulated skeletons that just
died yesterday. (<a href="javascript:cnnVideo('play','/video/tech/2006/08/24/natpkg.dinosaur.dig.cnn','2006/08/31');">Watch

<p>"This was a big river back in the time when the dinosaurs
lived here. Their carcasses got washed down the river and they
got scavenged, pulled apart. ... If something gets buried
immediately or right away, you may get the whole skeleton."
<p>But most of the time they find only pieces. Even so, it's a
thrill, Sorrentino said.
<p>And how do you tell a bone from a rock?
<p>"It just takes knowing what bones look like in the first
place. Being able to recognize the shapes they make," Sorrentino
said. Another way is sound. A light tap on a bone produces a
high-pitched sound, whereas a rock will make more of a thud. (<a href="javascript:cnnVideo('play','/video/tech/2006/08/24/dinosaur.rib.bone.affl','2006/08/31');">Watch
Sorrentino clean off a bone -- 1:10</a>)
<p>Sorrentino said the best bones for identifying a specific
dinosaur are the skull and teeth, and it helps if you have an
expert eye like Horner's.
<p>Early in the summer, the group found a Triceratops, a horned
plant-eating dinosaur.
<p>"We've got a Triceratops horn. There's a Triceratops in there
and the frill, the big shield, that it had at the back of their
head," Sorrentino said.
<p>Chisels, dental picks and paintbrushes are used to separate
the sediment from the bones. It's a delicate process that
requires a light touch and lots of patience -- it can take weeks
to successfully excavate a site. (<a href="javascript:cnnVideo('play','/video/tech/2006/08/24/time.lapse.john.little.affl','2006/08/31');">Watch

<p>The bones are then covered in some dirt and wrapped in
plaster bundles called jackets. They are hauled out on foot and
put on a truck for transport back to the lab in Bozeman. (<a href="javascript:cnnVideo('play','/video/tech/2006/08/24/vo.dinosaur.bone.drill.cnn','2006/08/31');">Watch

<h3>Under the microscope</h3>
<p>"When it comes right down to it, paleopathology really is
like dinosaur CSI," said Montana State University doctoral
student Ewan Wolf. Wolf works in the basement of the Museum of
the Rockies, X-raying fossils. He looks for signs of breaks that
have healed and for signs of disease.
<p>Meanwhile, researchers in a room next door to Wolf
painstakingly slice dinosaur bones paper thin for examination.
<p>"Fossil bone, despite being hundreds of millions of years
old, is amazingly preserved at the microscopic level," said
Museum of the Rockies histology technician Ellen-Therese Lamm.
<p>Looking at a bone from the outside can tell researchers how
dinosaurs looked, behaved, and were related to each other. At
the microscopic level, they can find out about their growth
history, diet and longevity.
<p>In 2003, paleontologist Mary Schweitzer at North Carolina
State University cut open one of the T-rex bones retrieved by
Horner and found medullary bone. Medullary bone is a thin layer
of vessels found in the leg bones of modern-day pregnant birds.
Schweitzer compared the leg bone of a female ostrich to the leg
bone of Horner's T-rex. Schweitzer concluded the T-rex must have
been a pregnant female -- a rare discovery that also helps link
birds to dinosaurs.
<p>" You walk around and look for bone
sticking out of the ground. It's easy to just find bone laying
on the ground out here." - Nels Peterson, Horner's crew chief
<p>Most scientists now believe birds evolved from Maniraptors --
meat-eating dinosaurs that lived 150 million years ago. Recent
findings of a Dromaeosaur, a small, fast, meat-eating dinosaur
(closely related to the Velociraptor) with primitive feathers
supports the theory.
<h3>The end</h3>
<p>Another popular puzzle is why dinosaurs became extinct. Was
it the breakup of the continents, the Earth's changing climate
or an asteroid strike off the Yucatan peninsula? No one knows
for sure, but they were around for 150 million years -- much
longer than humans.
<p>Back in the Hell Creek, University of the South geology
student Luke Padgett is standing on top of a hill overlooking
what was once dinosaur country.
<p>"We're not really any closer in understanding the end," he
said.
<p>Padgett scans the horizon for a black layer of sediment known
as the K-T boundary which marks the end of the age of dinosaurs.
<p>The K-T boundary contains a high amount of iridium, commonly
found in meteorites.
<p>"We know by that there was an [asteroid] impact at the end of
the Cretaceous. At that layer we can see really easily out here
with no trees. And there's an interesting pattern. There's
dinosaurs below it and no dinosaurs above it."
<p>But Padgett thinks it's not the end of the dinosaurs that
matters as much as how cool they were when they were alive and
what they can tell us about evolution.<p>
