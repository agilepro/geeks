<b>EQUAL TIME ALL THE TIME FOR EVERYONE</b><p>

By Minister Michael Shermer*<p>

<br>
Good morning ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.<p>

This morning we are going to talk about the creation of the universe and the<br>
origins of life on Earth. According to the Bible, Genesis 1:1-3: "In the<br>
beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without<br>
form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of<br>
God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light: and<br>
there was light.<p>

Now, it is important for us to understand that no one was actually present at<br>
the creation so we don't really know what happened. Genesis 1:1-3 is only a<br>
theory, and as such cannot be treated as fact and is really nothing more than<br>
an educated guess. It is only fair that we remember that there are other<br>
theories of the creation that deserve equal time. For example:<p>

Some Sumerians and Babylonians, Gilbert Islanders, Koreans, and Greeks<br>
believed that the world was created from the parts of a slain monster.<p>

Some Zuni Indians, Cook Islanders, and Tahitians have a theory that the world<br>
was created by the interaction (read "sex") of primordial parents.<p>

Some Japanese, Samoan, Persian, Chinese, and Hindu cultures have a theory<br>
that the world was generated from an egg.<p>

Some Mayan and Egyptian cultures have a theory that the world was created by<br>
the spoken edict (command) of a god. Oh, come to think of it, the Hebrews<br>
have this same theory.<p>

Some Burmese and Icelandic cultures have a theory that the world was created<br>
out of the sea.<p>

And, of course, there is that dogma being foisted upon us by the liberal<br>
media and left leaning academics, the theory of evolution. But remember, it<br>
is only a theory.<p>

As for the origins of human life, that is spelled out in Genesis 1:27: "God<br>
created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and<br>
female created he them."<p>

Of course, not only was no one present to witness this act (except for Adam<br>
and Eve after they were created), it should be pointed out that this theory<br>
has a counter theory in Genesis 2:7, where "the Lord God formed man of the<br>
dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and<br>
man became a living soul." In this theory Adam is all alone without a mate, <br>
so in Genesis 2:21-22 "the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam,<br>
and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead<br>
thereof; And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman,<br>
and brought her unto the man."<p>

Since everyone here was blessed by the almighty with a brain that thinks, I<br>
will allow you to decide which theory is the correct theory of the creation<br>
of humans: Genesis 1 or Genesis 2. Weigh the evidence and decide for<br>
yourselves. You be the judge.<p>

Oh, there is one other minor wrinkle in the story. Adam and Eve begat Cain<br>
and Abel. Now, Cain--as firstborns are wont to do to their laterborn<br>
siblings who might cut into their limited parental resources--slew him. That<br>
left Adam, Eve, and Cain as the only humans on the entire Earth. But in <br>
Genesis 4:17 we read that "Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare<br>
Enoch."<p>

Now, I don't mean to burden you with more of the liberal media's fascination<br>
with smut and porn, but I think as created beings endowed with intelligence<br>
and critical thinking skills blessed to us by the good Lord, it might be<br>
reasonable to ask just who it was that Cain "knew." Unless Adam was blessed<br>
with both types of reproductive organs, or Cain was capable of<br>
parthenogenesis, then we are left with the theory that Cain "knew" his mother.<p>

But that's just a theory, and as we all know, theories are just wild guesses<br>
and should not be taken seriously. Let us pray instead . . . . amen.<p>
