<h1>Senator Dianne Feinstein, on the flag protection amendment</h1>
May 25, 2005<p>

Dear Mr. Thomas:<p>

Thank you for writing to express your opposition to a
constitutional amendment prohibiting the physical desecration of the
American flag.&nbsp;  I appreciate your taking the time to share your thoughts
with me.<p>

Unfortunately, we will have to disagree about this issue.&nbsp;  I
strongly believe that the American flag holds a unique position in our
society as the most important and universally recognized symbol that
unites us as a nation.&nbsp;  The flag -- as a symbol of our nationhood -- can
and should be respected and protected from attack.&nbsp;  Beyond my personal
convictions, many Californians have told me of their desire for such
protection for our flag.&nbsp;  Indeed, California had a flag protection statute
from 1929 until 1989, when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the
flag protection statutes of 47 states and the Federal government.<p>

The authority for a nation to protect its central symbol of unity
was considered constitutional for two centuries.&nbsp;  It was only a decade
ago that a narrow majority of the U.S. Supreme Court said otherwise.&nbsp;  At
this point, it seems clear that the only way to protect the American flag is
to amend the Constitution to authorize Congress to prohibit the physical
desecration of the flag.&nbsp;  In the 108th Congress I was an original cosponsor
of Senate Joint Resolution 4 (S. J. Res. 4) which would have done just
that.&nbsp;  I will continue to pursue the topic in the 109th Congress.<p>

Please know that I value your opinion, but on this issue I am
afraid we will remain in disagreement.&nbsp;  However, I greatly appreciate
your input and hope that you will continue to share your views with me.&nbsp;
If I can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to call my
Washington, DC staff at (202) 224-3841.<p>
		
Sincerely yours,<p>

Dianne Feinstein<br>
United States Senator<p>
