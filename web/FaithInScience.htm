<h1>Our Faith in Science</h1>

<p>SCIENCE has always fascinated me. As a child in Tibet, I was
keenly curious about how things worked. When I got a toy I would
play with it a bit, then take it apart to see how it was put
together. As I became older, I applied the same scrutiny to a
movie projector and an antique automobile.
<p>At one point I became particularly intrigued by an old
telescope, with which I would study the heavens. One night while
looking at the moon I realized that there were shadows on its
surface. I corralled my two main tutors to show them, because
this was contrary to the ancient version of cosmology I had been
taught, which held that the moon was a heavenly body that
emitted its own light.
<p>But through my telescope the moon was clearly just a barren
rock, pocked with craters. If the author of that fourth-century
treatise were writing today, I'm sure he would write the chapter
on cosmology differently.
<p>If science proves some belief of Buddhism wrong, then
Buddhism will have to change. In my view, science and Buddhism
share a search for the truth and for understanding reality. By
learning from science about aspects of reality where its
understanding may be more advanced, I believe that Buddhism
enriches its own worldview.
<p>For many years now, on my own and through the Mind and Life
Institute, which I helped found, I have had the opportunity to
meet with scientists to discuss their work. World-class
scientists have generously coached me in subatomic physics,
cosmology, psychology, biology.
<p>It is our discussions of neuroscience, however, that have
proved particularly important. From these exchanges a vigorous
research initiative has emerged, a collaboration between monks
and neuroscientists, to explore how meditation might alter brain
function.
<p>The goal here is not to prove Buddhism right or wrong - or
even to bring people to Buddhism - but rather to take these
methods out of the traditional context, study their potential
benefits, and share the findings with anyone who might find them
helpful.
<p>After all, if practices from my own tradition can be brought
together with scientific methods, then we may be able to take
another small step toward alleviating human suffering.
<p>Already this collaboration has borne fruit. Dr. Richard
Davidson, a neuroscientist at the University of Wisconsin, has
published results from brain imaging studies of lamas
meditating. He found that during meditation the regions of the
brain thought to be related to happiness increase in activity.
He also found that the longer a person has been a meditator, the
greater the activity increase will be.
<p>Other studies are under way. At Princeton University, Dr.
Jonathan Cohen, a neuroscientist, is studying the effects of
meditation on attention. At the University of California Medical
School at San Francisco, Dr. Margaret Kemeny has been studying
how meditation helps develop empathy in school teachers.
<p>Whatever the results of this work, I am encouraged that it is
taking place. You see, many people still consider science and
religion to be in opposition. While I agree that certain
religious concepts conflict with scientific facts and
principles, I also feel that people from both worlds can have an
intelligent discussion, one that has the power ultimately to
generate a deeper understanding of challenges we face together
in our interconnected world.
<p>One of my first teachers of science was the German physicist
Carl von Weizsäcker, who had been an apprentice to the quantum
theorist Werner Heisenberg. Dr. Weizsäcker was kind enough to
give me some formal tutorials on scientific topics. (I confess
that while listening to him I would feel I could grasp the
intricacies of the full argument, but when the sessions were
over there was often not a great deal of his explanation left
behind.)
<p>What impressed me most deeply was how Dr. Weizsäcker worried
about both the philosophical implications of quantum physics and
the ethical consequences of science generally. He felt that
science could benefit from exploring issues usually left to the
humanities.
<p>I believe that we must find a way to bring ethical
considerations to bear upon the direction of scientific
development, especially in the life sciences. By invoking
fundamental ethical principles, I am not advocating a fusion of
religious ethics and scientific inquiry.
<p>Rather, I am speaking of what I call "secular ethics," which
embrace the principles we share as human beings: compassion,
tolerance, consideration of others, the responsible use of
knowledge and power. These principles transcend the barriers
between religious believers and non-believers; they belong not
to one faith, but to all faiths.
<p>Today, our knowledge of the human brain and body at the
cellular and genetic level has reached a new level of
sophistication. Advances in genetic manipulation, for example,
mean scientists can create new genetic entities - like hybrid
animal and plant species - whose long-term consequences are
unknown.
<p>Sometimes when scientists concentrate on their own narrow
fields, their keen focus obscures the larger effect their work
might have. In my conversations with scientists I try to remind
them of the larger goal behind what they do in their daily work.
<p>This is more important than ever. It is all too evident that
our moral thinking simply has not been able to keep pace with
the speed of scientific advancement. Yet the ramifications of
this progress are such that it is no longer adequate to say that
the choice of what to do with this knowledge should be left in
the hands of individuals.
<p>This is a point I intend to make when I speak at the annual
meeting of the Society for Neuroscience today in Washington. I
will suggest that how science relates to wider humanity is no
longer of academic interest alone. This question must assume a
sense of urgency for all those who are concerned about the fate
of human existence.
<p>A deeper dialogue between neuroscience and society - indeed
between all scientific fields and society - could help deepen
our understanding of what it means to be human and our
responsibilities for the natural world we share with other
sentient beings.
<p>Just as the world of business has been paying renewed
attention to ethics, the world of science would benefit from
more deeply considering the implications of its own work.
Scientists should be more than merely technically adept; they
should be mindful of their own motivation and the larger goal of
what they do: the betterment of humanity.
