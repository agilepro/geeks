W. David Hager, a Kentucky obstetrician and gynecologist, has refused to
prescribe contraceptives for single women and recommends Scripture readings as
treatment for premenstrual syndrome, headaches, postpartum depression and eating
disorders. He bases his practice on ideology, not science, which explains why
the like-minded President Bush reappointed him to a critical Food and Drug
Administration advisory panel.<br>
<br>
Before he first was appointed two years ago to the Reproductive Health Drugs
Advisory Committee, Dr. Hager had petitioned the FDA to block the use of RU-486.
His goal of getting the FDA to reverse its approval of the alternative to
surgical abortion could hamper development of the drug as a treatment for other
conditions such as brain tumors, ovarian and uterine cancer, prostate cancer and
fibroid tumors. This year, Dr. Hager was one of four who voted against the FDA's
approval of over-the-counter sales of emergency contraceptive pills -- ignoring
the advice of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Public Health Association.<br>
<br>
His reasoning no doubt can be found in <i>Stress and the Woman's Body</i>, the
book Dr. Hager and his wife co-wrote, suggesting that women use Scripture to
cure their physical ailments. For headaches, Dr. Hager recommends Matthew
13:44-46 ("The kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a
field"). For premenstrual syndrome, he suggests Romans 5:1-11
("Tribulation worketh patience"). For postpartum depression, he
reminds mothers of Psalm 34:18 ("The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a
broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit"), Revelation 21:4
("And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no
more... pain") or II Samuel 22:29 ("For thou art my lamp, O Lord; and
the Lord will lighten my darkness").<br>
<br>
As a bipartisan group of representatives wrote to President Bush, "Dr.
Hager's blatant opposition to so many safe and legal options makes him unfit to
serve on this key advisory committee." Mr. Bush's appointment of Dr. Hager,
though, was predictable; he routinely ignores fact in the bogus name of divine
leadership. It all brings to mind this biblical admonition: "Beware of
false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are
ravening wolves." Beware, especially, of false prophets who come along
during election years.
