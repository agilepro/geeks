<h1>Why the Government Should Not Post the Ten Commandments</h1>
</div>
by John B. Hodges<p>
For centuries, millennia, the theory that justified tyranny and
oppression was "the Divine Right of Kings". Government was alleged to
be a divine institution, rulers got their authority from God. This
theory is taught in the Bible (Romans 13), but it is older than that.
Theocracy is the most ancient theory of government.<p>

The history of divinely anointed government was not good. The Bible
has not one word supporting religious liberty; on the contrary.
Deuteronomy 5 (the first Commandment) tells us to worship Yahveh
only, and Deuteronomy 13 tells us to kill anyone who doesn't. The
first seven Commandments all carry the death penalty, according to
the surrounding text. Neither does the Bible support "equal rights"
in any form; slavery was taken for granted, in the Old Testament and
the New.<p>

In the American Revolution we rebelled against this theory. King
George the Third was allegedly King by the grace of God; our founders
denied that. They could have set up another King, and claimed that
our new government ruled by the grace of God, but they did not.  They
declared a different theory, that governments were human
institutions, created by the people for their mutual defense.
Governments represented the people, receiving their authority from
the people. The first 52 words of our Constitution state this
premise. Our government is not authorized to speak, much less rule,
on religious matters; individual conscience rules instead.<p>

Liberty and democracy were challenged in the past 150 years by
theories of socialism. The National Socialism of the Nazis, the
one-party "vanguard" of the Bolsheviks, both claimed to represent the
people but valued neither liberty nor democracy. Both have been
discredited, neither is now the inspiration for large popular
movements. The rising threat for the coming century, strangely
enough, seems to be theocracy again.<p>

Everyone has heard of Muslim theocrats in Iran and Afghanistan, but
we have homegrown Christian theocrats in America. They are doing
their best to lead a popular movement, to rewrite the history of
America in their own image. They want the government to post the
Commandments because that would proclaim the theocratic premise, that
the law comes from God, and the government rules by the authority of
God.<p>

Some have argued that posting the Commandments harms nobody,
establishes no particular religion. But this is naiive, if not
dishonest. The theocrats are moving one step at at time; they will
get to burning heretics in due course.<p>
