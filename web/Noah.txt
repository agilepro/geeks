A conservative estimate of the lifeforms that Noah would have had to collect is:
Insects: 1,000,000
Mammals: 4,008
Birds: 8,600
Reptiles: 6,252
Amphibians: 2,000
TOTAL SPECIES - 1,020,860
TOTAL IF IN PAIRS - 2,041,720

But 'clean' animals were in sevens, not pairs.

So, shall we say, 5,000,000 – give or take a dozen

And then there's the problem of sea creatures which god also destroyed –- "every living thing."
