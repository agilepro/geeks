IN DEFENSE OF BIBLICAL MARRIAGE
The Presidential Prayer Team is currently urging us to: "Pray for the 
President as he seeks wisdom on how to legally codify the definition 
of marriage. Pray that it will be according to Biblical principles. 
With any forces insisting on variant definitions of marriage, pray 
that God's Word and His standards will be honored by our government."
Any good religious person believes prayer should be balanced by 
action. So here, in support of the Prayer Team's admirable goals, is 
a proposed Constitutional Amendment codifying marriage entirely on 
biblical principles:
A. Marriage in the United States shall consist of a union between one 
man and one or more women.(Gen 29:17-28; II Sam 3:2-5.)
B. Marriage shall not impede a man's right to take concubines in 
addition to his wife or wives. (II Sam 5:13; I Kings 11:3; II 
Chron11:21)
C. A marriage shall be considered valid only if the wife is a virgin. 
If the wife is not a virgin, she shall be executed (Deut 22:13-21)
D. Marriage of a believer and a non-believer shall be forbidden.(Gen 
24:3; Num 25:1-9; Ezra 9:12; Neh 10:30)
E. Since marriage is for life, neither this Constitution nor the 
constitution of any State, nor any state or federal law, shall be 
construed to permit divorce. (Deut 22:19; Mark 10:9)
F. If a married man dies without children, his brother shall marry 
the widow. If he refuses to marry his brother's widow or deliberately 
does not give her children, he shall pay a fine of one shoe and be 
otherwise punished in a manner to be determined by law. (Gen. 
38:6-10; Deut 25:5-10) *
G. In lieu of marriage, if there are no acceptable men in your town, 
it is required that you get your dad drunk and have sex with him 
(even if he had previously offered you up as a sex toy to men young 
and old), tag-teaming with any sisters you may have. Of course, this 
rule applies only if you are female.
(Gen 19:31-36)

(Samson--Judges 14:1-3)
* Kill any husband and take HIS wife (Prepare to lose four sons, 
though). (David--2 Samuel 11)
* Wait for your brother to die. Take his widow. (It's not just a good 
idea; it's the law.) (Onana and Boaz--Deuteronomy or Leviticus,

Kings 11:1-3)

TOP 7 WAYS TO ACQUIRE A HUSBAND (from J. Duin)
* Have your husband act like a jerk toward a famous warlord while you 
secretly show up at the warlord's camp with muleloads of tasty

which point you inform your husband of the whole matter, at which

substitute yourself for her on their wedding night.
* Hang around barren women and offer to be a concubine for their 
husbands' need.
* Take a bath on your roof preferably in view of some nearby 
apartment buildings.
