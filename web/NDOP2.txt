<p><hr><H2>Thursday, May 5, 11:15am - 1:00pm:<br><font color=red>PROTEST</font>
of the National Day of Prayer event at S.J. City Hall</h2>
Atheists of Silicon Valley will lead a protest against the National Day of Prayer event, as we have for the last
four years. This is a federally-funded annual abuse of the Constitution.<p>
We will have signs to hold up, and pamphlets to hand out. There will be plenty of xtian highschoolers who get the
time off to come to this, and are often interested in an alternative view. We can help open their minds.<p>
After all this fun, we'll retire to the nearby Togo's for food and refreshment.<p>
See Joe Mercado's <a href=NDOP2004.htm>write-up</a> of last year's event.<p>
