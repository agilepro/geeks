Hi Skip,

Thanks for your insights.

It is increasingly troubling to me that people can say almost anything and, by cloaking their statements with a religious aura, claim that they can't be criticized.  To me, religion should be about what is good in people.  However it is often used to promote such garbage as creationism.   Racism, misogyny, slavery, and flat-earthism were once seen as having a religious basis.  Should they have not been criticized because of this?

I think that scientific thought is at a disadvantage, because it plays fair, while those making outlandish claims often do not.  How can we show the facts of evolution, without causing a negative reaction?

Here's a quote that I like, by Lawrence M. Krauss.
"Scientists must not allow nonsense to remain unconfronted, regardless of whose sensibilities we offend. Once we allow empirical truth to be blurred with impunity in one important area of human activity, we jeopardize the very basis of a healthy democracy."

What do you suggest that I can say about evolution, or NCSE?

Sincerely,
Mark Thomas

Hi Mark,

I talked to Genie about your efforts, and while we both support you efforts personally, NCSE has to be very careful to avoid appearing anti-religious, something we are accused of more than regularly.

Because we maintain an absolute neutral position concerning religion, we
do prefer our literature not be distributed at public events where it may give the impression NCSE's stand is against religion.

I hope you can understand our position; it is certainly not meant in any
way to mean we don't appreciate your efforts on behalf atheists.

Thanks,
Skip

Last year, I talked to many high school kids who were brainwashed with creationism (along with a bunch of other ideas).  However they were typically at least open to discussing evolution.
