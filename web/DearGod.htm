Dear God,<br>
hope you got the letter, and...<br>
I pray you can make it better down here.<br>
I don't mean a big reduction in the price of beer<br>
but all the people that you made in your image, see<br>
them starving on their feet 'cause they don't get<br>
enough to eat from God, I can't believe in you<p>

Dear God, sorry to disturb you, but... I feel that I should be heard<br>
loud and clear. We all need a big reduction in amount of tears<br>
and all the people that you made in your image, see them fighting<br>
in the street 'cause they can't make opinions meet about God,<br>
I can't believe in you<p>

Did you make disease, and the diamond blue? Did you make<br>
mankind after we made you? And the devil too!<p>

Dear God, don't know if you noticed, but... your name is on<br>
a lot of quotes in this book.  Us crazy humans wrote it, you<br>
should take a look.  And all the people that you made in your<br>
image still believing that junk is true. Well I know it ain't, and<br>
so do you, dear God, I can't believe in I don't believe in<p>

I won't believe in heaven and hell. No saints, no sinners, no<br>
devil as well. No pearly gates, no thorny crown. You're always<br>
letting us humans down. The wars you bring, the babes you<br>
drown. Those lost at sea and never found, and it's the same the<br>
whole world 'round. The hurt I see helps to compound that<br>
Father, Son and Holy Ghost is just somebody's unholy hoax,<br>
and if you're up there you'd perceive that my heart's here upon<br>
my sleeve. If there's one thing I don't believe in<br>
it's you.... dear god<br>
