<i>The credit crunch could be a boon for irrational belief</i></a>.
<p>WHILE many institutions collapsed during the Great Depression that began in
1929, one kind did rather well. During this leanest of times, the strictest,
most authoritarian churches saw a surge in attendance.
<p>This anomaly was documented in the early 1970s, but only now is science
beginning to tell us why. It turns out that human beings have a natural
inclination for religious belief, especially during hard times. Our brains
effortlessly conjure up an imaginary world of spirits, gods and monsters, and
the more insecure we feel, the harder it is to resist the pull of this
supernatural world. It seems that our minds are finely tuned to believe in gods.
<p>Religious ideas are common to all cultures: like language and music, they
seem to be part of what it is to be human. Until recently, science has largely
shied away from asking why. "It's not that religion is not important," says Paul
Bloom, a psychologist at Yale University, "it's that the taboo nature of the
topic has meant there has been little progress."
<p>The origin of religious belief is something of a mystery, but in recent years
scientists have started to make suggestions. One leading idea is that religion
is an evolutionary adaptation that makes people more likely to survive and pass
their genes onto the next generation. In this view, shared religious belief
helped our ancestors form tightly knit groups that cooperated in hunting,
foraging and childcare, enabling these groups to outcompete others. In this way,
the theory goes, religion was selected for by evolution, and eventually
permeated every human society
<p>The religion-as-an-adaptation theory doesn't wash with everybody, however. As
anthropologist Scott Atran of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor points
out, the benefits of holding such unfounded beliefs are questionable, in terms
of evolutionary fitness. "I don't think the idea makes much sense, given the
kinds of things you find in religion," he says. A belief in life after death,
for example, is hardly compatible with surviving in the here-and-now and
propagating your genes. Moreover, if there are adaptive advantages of religion,
they do not explain its origin, but simply how it spread.
<p>An alternative being put forward by Atran and others is that religion emerges
as a natural by-product of the way the human mind works.
<p>That's not to say that the human brain has a "god module" in the same way
that it has a language module that evolved specifically for acquiring language.
Rather, some of the unique cognitive capacities that have made us so successful
as a species also work together to create a tendency for supernatural thinking.
"There's now a lot of evidence that some of the foundations for our religious
beliefs are hard-wired," says Bloom.
<p>Much of that evidence comes from experiments carried out on children, who are
seen as revealing a "default state" of the mind that persists, albeit in
modified form, into adulthood. "Children the world over have a strong natural
receptivity to believing in gods because of the way their minds work, and this
early developing receptivity continues to anchor our intuitive thinking
throughout life," says anthropologist Justin Barrett of the University of
Oxford.
<p>So how does the brain conjure up gods? One of the key factors, says Bloom, is
the fact that our brains have separate cognitive systems for dealing with living
things - things with minds, or at least volition - and inanimate objects.
<p>This separation happens very early in life. Bloom and colleagues have shown
that babies as young as five months make a distinction between inanimate objects
and people. Shown a box moving in a stop-start way, babies show surprise. But a
person moving in the same way elicits no surprise. To babies, objects ought to
obey the laws of physics and move in a predictable way. People, on the other
hand, have their own intentions and goals, and move however they choose.
<h3>Mind and matter</h3>
<p>Bloom says the two systems are autonomous, leaving us with two viewpoints on
the world: one that deals with minds, and one that handles physical aspects of
the world. He calls this innate assumption that mind and matter are distinct
"common-sense dualism". The body is for physical processes, like eating and
moving, while the mind carries our consciousness in a separate - and separable -
package. "We very naturally accept you can leave your body in a dream, or in
astral projection or some sort of magic," Bloom says. "These are universal
views."
<p>There is plenty of evidence that thinking about disembodied minds comes
naturally. People readily form relationships with non-existent others: roughly
half of all 4-year-olds have had an imaginary friend, and adults often form and
maintain relationships with dead relatives, fictional characters and fantasy
partners. As Barrett points out, this is an evolutionarily useful skill. Without
it we would be unable to maintain large social hierarchies and alliances or
anticipate what an unseen enemy might be planning. "Requiring a body around to
think about its mind would be a great liability," he says.
<p>Useful as it is, common-sense dualism also appears to prime the brain for
supernatural concepts such as life after death. In 2004, Jesse Bering of Queen's
University Belfast, UK, put on a puppet show for a group of pre-school children.
During the show, an alligator ate a mouse. The researchers then asked the
children questions about the physical existence of the mouse, such as: "Can the
mouse still be sick? Does it need to eat or drink?" The children said no. But
when asked more "spiritual" questions, such as "does the mouse think and know
things?", the children answered yes.
<h3>Default to god</h3>
<p>Based on these and other experiments, Bering considers a belief in some form
of life apart from that experienced in the body to be the default setting of the
human brain. Education and experience teach us to override it, but it never
truly leaves us, he says. From there it is only a short step to conceptualising
spirits, dead ancestors and, of course, gods, says Pascal Boyer, a psychologist
at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri. Boyer points out that people
expect their gods' minds to work very much like human minds, suggesting they
spring from the same brain system that enables us to think about absent or
non-existent people.
<p>The ability to conceive of gods, however, is not sufficient to give rise to
religion. The mind has another essential attribute: an overdeveloped sense of
cause and effect which primes us to see purpose and design everywhere, even
where there is none. "You see bushes rustle, you assume there's somebody or
something there," Bloom says.
<p>This over-attribution of cause and effect probably evolved for survival. If
there are predators around, it is no good spotting them 9 times out of 10.
Running away when you don't have to is a small price to pay for avoiding danger
when the threat is real.
<p>Again, experiments on young children reveal this default state of the mind.
Children as young as three readily attribute design and purpose to inanimate
objects. When Deborah Kelemen of the University of Arizona in Tucson asked 7 and
8-year-old children questions about inanimate objects and animals, she found
that most believed they were created for a specific purpose. Pointy rocks are
there for animals to scratch themselves on. Birds exist "to make nice music",
while rivers exist so boats have something to float on. "It was extraordinary to
hear children saying that things like mountains and clouds were 'for' a purpose
and appearing highly resistant to any counter-suggestion," says Kelemen.
<p>In similar experiments, Olivera Petrovich of the University of Oxford asked
pre-school children about the origins of natural things such as plants and
animals. She found they were seven times as likely to answer that they were made
by god than made by people.
<p>These cognitive biases are so strong, says Petrovich, that children tend to
spontaneously invent the concept of god without adult intervention: "They rely
on their everyday experience of the physical world and construct the concept of
god on the basis of this experience." Because of this, when children hear the
claims of religion they seem to make perfect sense.
<p>Our predisposition to believe in a supernatural world stays with us as we get
older. Kelemen has found that adults are just as inclined to see design and
intention where there is none. Put under pressure to explain natural phenomena,
adults often fall back on teleological arguments, such as "trees produce oxygen
so that animals can breathe" or "the sun is hot because warmth nurtures life".
Though she doesn't yet have evidence that this tendency is linked to belief in
god, Kelemen does have results showing that most adults tacitly believe they
have souls.
<p>Boyer is keen to point out that religious adults are not childish or
weak-minded. Studies reveal that religious adults have very different mindsets
from children, concentrating more on the moral dimensions of their faith and
less on its supernatural attributes.
<p>Even so, religion is an inescapable artefact of the wiring in our brain, says
Bloom. "All humans possess the brain circuitry and that never goes away."
Petrovich adds that even adults who describe themselves as atheists and
agnostics are prone to supernatural thinking. Bering has seen this too. When one
of his students carried out interviews with atheists, it became clear that they
often tacitly attribute purpose to significant or traumatic moments in their
lives, as if some agency were intervening to make it happen. "They don't
completely exorcise the ghost of god - they just muzzle it," Bering says.
<p>The fact that trauma is so often responsible for these slips gives a clue as
to why adults find it so difficult to jettison their innate belief in gods,
Atran says. The problem is something he calls "the tragedy of cognition". Humans
can anticipate future events, remember the past and conceive of how things could
go wrong - including their own death, which is hard to deal with. "You've got to
figure out a solution, otherwise you're overwhelmed," Atran says. When natural
brain processes give us a get-out-of-jail card, we take it.
<p>That view is backed up by an experiment published late last year (<a target="nsarticle" href=http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1159845><i>Science</i>,
vol 322, p 115</a>). Jennifer Whitson of the University of Texas in Austin and
Adam Galinsky of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, asked people
what patterns they could see in arrangements of dots or stock market
information. Before asking, Whitson and Galinsky made half their participants
feel a lack of control, either by giving them feedback unrelated to their
performance or by having them recall experiences where they had lost control of
a situation.
<p>The results were striking. The subjects who sensed a loss of control were
much more likely to see patterns where there were none. "We were surprised that
the phenomenon is as widespread as it is," Whitson says. What's going on, she
suggests, is that when we feel a lack of control we fall back on superstitious
ways of thinking. That would explain why religions enjoy a revival during hard
times.
<p>So if religion is a natural consequence of how our brains work, where does
that leave god? All the researchers involved stress that none of this says
anything about the existence or otherwise of gods: as Barratt points out,
whether or not a belief is true is independent of why people believe it.
<p>It does, however, suggests that god isn't going away, and that atheism will
always be a hard sell. Religious belief is the "path of least resistance", says
Boyer, while disbelief requires effort.
<p>These findings also challenge the idea that religion is an adaptation. "Yes,
religion helps create large societies - and once you have large societies you
can outcompete groups that don't," Atran says. "But it arises as an artefact of
the ability to build fictive worlds. I don't think there's an adaptation for
religion any more than there's an adaptation to make airplanes."
<p>I don't think there's an adaptation for religion any more than
there's an adaptation to make airplanes
<p>Supporters of the adaptation hypothesis, however, say that the two ideas are
not mutually exclusive. As David Sloan Wilson of Binghamton University in New
York state points out, elements of religious belief could have arisen as a
by-product of brain evolution, but religion per se was selected for because it
promotes group survival. "Most adaptations are built from previous structures,"
he says. "Boyer's basic thesis and my basic thesis could both be correct."
<p>Robin Dunbar of the University of Oxford - the researcher most strongly
identified with the religion-as-adaptation argument - also has no problem with
the idea that religion co-opts brain circuits that evolved for something else.
Richard Dawkins, too, sees the two camps as compatible. "Why shouldn't both be
correct?" he says. "I actually think they are."
<p>Ultimately, discovering the true origins of something as complex as religion
will be difficult. There is one experiment, however, that could go a long way to
proving whether Boyer, Bloom and the rest are onto something profound. Ethical
issues mean it won't be done any time soon, but that hasn't stopped people
speculating about the outcome.
<p>It goes something like this. Left to their own devices, children create their
own "creole" languages using hard-wired linguistic brain circuits. A similar
experiment would provide our best test of the innate religious inclinations of
humans. Would a group of children raised in isolation spontaneously create their
own religious beliefs? "I think the answer is yes," says Bloom.
<p><h3>God of the gullibile</h3>
<p>In <i>The God Delusion</i>, Richard Dawkins argues that religion is
propagated through indoctrination, especially of children. Evolution
predisposes children to swallow whatever their parents and tribal elders
tell them, he argues, as trusting obedience is valuable for survival. This
also leads to what Dawkins calls "slavish gullibility" in the face of
religious claims.
<p>If children have an innate belief in god, however, where does that leave
the indoctrination hypothesis? "I am thoroughly happy with believing that
children are predisposed to believe in invisible gods - I always was," says
Dawkins. "But I also find the indoctrination hypothesis plausible. The two
influences could, and I suspect do, reinforce one another." He suggests that
evolved gullibility converts a child's general predisposition to believe in
god into a specific belief in the god (or gods) their parents worship.
