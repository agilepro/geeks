<h2>Conservative Satanic Agenda for Bush</h2>
Salutations and warm regards!<p>

We at the Conservative Satanic Agenda (CSA) believe<br>
that in these frightening and confusing times, it is<br>
vitally important to put aside our individual<br>
differences and SUPPORT OUR LEADERS. Now more than<br>
ever, we need leaders in Washington who will stand<br>
firm in defense of our national interests, both here<br>
and abroad.<p>

The Bush Administration has stood for America through<br>
a horrifying crisis and potentially endless war, and<br>
we as a nation must continue to support the strength<br>
that our leaders have come to represent, so that we<br>
may remain the most powerful nation on earth. We at<br>
CSA are of the highest hope that you will consider the<br>
timely importance of standing behind strong leadership<br>
when going to the polls this fall.<p>

Thank you for your consideration.<p>

The Nine Satanic Statements<p>

By Anton Szandor LaVey [i]<p>

1. Satan represents indulgence, instead of abstinence!<p>

By bowing out of the Kyoto treaty and refusing to<br>
discuss global climate change, President Bush has<br>
insured that American industries will continue to<br>
prosper.<p>

2. Satan represents vital existence, instead of<br>
spiritual pipe dreams!<p>

. Now more than ever, citizens of the modern world<br>
require prosperity and growth to meet the challenges<br>
of the coming era, and we believe that among<br>
politicians, the Bush Administration is uniquely in<br>
touch with this reality.<p>

3. Satan represents undefiled wisdom, instead of<br>
hypocritical self-deceit!<p>

We at CSA wholeheartedly endorse Defense Secretary<br>
Donald Rumsfeld’s recent statements to the effect that<br>
it’s not important whether the world approves of our<br>
impending strikes against Iraq; it is only important<br>
that we do what we know to be right.<p>

4. Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it,<br>
instead of love wasted on ingrates!<p>

The Bush Administration has consistently and<br>
intelligently linked aid to third world countries to<br>
development, and backed away from wasting resources on<br>
dead-end welfare programs. <p>

5. Satan represents vengeance, instead of turning the<br>
other cheek!<p>

We call your attention to The Administration’s<br>
masterful retaliation against Al-Queda and their<br>
sympathizers after 9/11. <p>

6. Satan represents responsibility to the responsible,<br>
instead of concern for vampires!<p>

Civilization as we know it runs on energy. It is very<br>
important that our energy sources remain secure and<br>
intact. President Bush lives with the burden of this<br>
awesome responsibility every day. <p>

7. Satan represents man as just another animal,<br>
sometimes better, more often worse than those who walk<br>
on all fours, who, because of his “divine spiritual<br>
and intellectual development”, has become the most<br>
vicious animal of all!<br>
---- "These are the kind that go to a cave and send<br>
youngsters to their suicidal death. That's the kind of<br>
people we're fighting. But there's no cave deep enough<br>
for America, or dark enough to hide." George W. Bush,<br>
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Aug. 29, 2002<p>

8. Satan represents all of the so-called sins, as they<br>
all lead to physical, mental, or emotional<br>
gratification!<p>

While it may not be politically expedient to discuss<br>
what George W. did prior to becoming Governer of<br>
Texas, we would like to simply say that this man most<br>
certainly has our confidence.<p>

9. Satan has been the best friend the church has ever<br>
had, as He has kept it in business all these years!<p>

CSA strongly supports President Bush’s faith-based<br>
social programs.<br>
