<td vAlign="top"><span class="textcopy"><p><br>PEOPLE are to be tortured in
laboratories at Oxford University in a United States-funded
experiment to determine whether belief in God is effective in
relieving pain.
<p>Top neurologists, pharmacologists, anatomists, ethicists and
theologians are to examine the scientific basis of religious
belief and whether it is anything more than a placebo.
<p>
Headed by Baroness Greenfield, the leading neurologist, the new
Centre for the Science of the Mind is to use imaging systems to
find out how religious, spiritual and other belief systems, such
as an illogical belief in the innate superiority of men, influence
consciousness.
<p>A central aspect of the two-year study, which has $2 million (£1.06
million) funding from the John Templeton Foundation, the US
philanthropic body, will involve dozens of people being subjected
to painful experiments in laboratory conditions.
<p>While enduring the agony, they will be exposed to religious
symbols such as images of the Virgin Mary or a crucifix. Their
neurological responses will be measured to determine the efficacy
of their faith in helping them to cope.
<p>The aim is to develop new and practical approaches “for
promoting wellbeing and ultimately maximising individual human
potential”.
<p>The pain experiments will be conducted under the direction of
Toby Collins, who has a background in marine biology and the nerve
systems of invertebrates. He said that many people in pain turned
to faith for relief. Some looked to religious or secular healing
systems.
<p>He said that the experiments would involve non-invasive
simulation of burns and will be conducted according to strict
ethical rules. As they suffer, the human guinea pigs will be asked
to access a belief system, whether religious or otherwise.
<p>Dr Collins said: “We will simulate a burn sensation to see
how people, through distraction or by accessing different
strategies, can modulate and reduce the levels of pain.”
<p>John Stein, a neuroscientist from Oxford’s physiology
department, said: “Pain has been central to a lot of problems
that religious and other thinkers have concentrated on.”
<p>Professor Stein said that people differed widely in the extent
to which they felt pain. “What we want to do is correlate that
with their underlying beliefs.”
<p>The study is considered of vital importance in the present
world climate, given the role of religious fundamentalism in
international terrorism. A better understanding of the physiology
of belief, the conditions that entrench it in the mind and its
usefulness in mitigating pain could be crucial to developing
counter-terrorist strategies for the future.
<p>Scientists have long been baffled at the persistence of these
beliefs in the face of seemingly irrefutable logic. Professor
Lewis Wolpert, the biologist, has speculated in the past that a
belief in how the world was created and what happens after death
may have conferred an evolutionary advantage.
<p>The new centre will investigate how people form belief and how
the mind works in relations to belief. Scientists will examine
what causes people to change their beliefs, and how this affects
the mind. Lady Greenfield, Professor of Synaptic Pharmacology at
Oxford and director of the Royal Institution of Great Britain in
Mayfair, Central London, said: “To the best of my knowledge,
this centre will be the first of its kind in the UK, if not in
Europe. It brings together equal numbers of academics from the
humanities and the sciences, approaching the same problem.”
<p><strong>PAST TORTURE</strong><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Two thousand years ago, crucifixion was a favoured form of torture
and execution. Christians were also sewn up in the skins of wild
beasts and dogs let loose on them.
<li>The rack was used by the Inquisition which began in 1232 when
Emperor Frederick II issued an edict against heretics.
<li>The Spanish Inquisition of the 15th century was aimed
originally at Marranos, baptised Jews suspected of having
returned to their old faith.</span>
