Creationist Ray Comfort recently distributed thousands of free copies of Darwin's <i>On the Origin of Species</i> to students at U.S.
universities.&nbsp; The catch?&nbsp; This edition of <i>Origin</i> includes a 54-page "special" introduction written by Comfort.&nbsp; The
<a href=http://www.ncseweb.org>National Center for Science Education</a> has created a special web site, called
<a href=http://www.dontdissdarwin.com>Don't Diss Darwin</a>, to explain the "mistakes, half truths, untruths, muddled logic,
old creationist arguments, misleadingly excerpted quotations, and ill-framed analogies" in Comfort's introduction.<p>

Did Ray Comfort plagiarize part of his "special introduction" to the Origin of Species? That's the charge of Stan Guffey, a lecturer in biology at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, who told the Knoxville Metro Pulse (December 2, 2009), "The introduction begins with a nice, sweet little biography, then degenerates into intellectually lame, lazy distortions, selective reading of the literature, picking and choosing of facts, and misreadings of the historical record." He added that Comfort "gently moves folks into the notion that they don’t want to read what comes after the introduction.
He just wants his 50 pages read, 47 of which are anti-intellectual, dishonest drivel, the first three of which are pretty good because I wrote them."<p>

For further insights on creationism, Michael Shermer has a pamphlet called "<a href=LINKS/HTDaC.pdf>How to Debate a Creationist</a>."<p><hr><p>

The Washington Post has a good article on human evolution:<br>

<b>Evolution</b></a>, by PBS and narrated by Liam Neeson, dramatizes Darwin’s life while explaining the science behind evolution.
<p><hr><p>The PBS series NOVA has: <a href=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/id>"Judgment Day: Intelligent Design on Trial"</a><p>
In this program, NOVA captures the turmoil that tore apart the
community of Dover, Pennsylvania in one of the latest battles over
teaching evolution in public schools. Featuring trial reenactments
based on court transcripts and interviews with key participants,
including expert scientists and Dover parents, teachers, and town
officials, "Judgment Day: Intelligent Design on Trial" follows the
celebrated federal case of Kitzmiller v. Dover School District.<p>
Also, Resources, the Teacher's Guide, the program transcript, and more.<p>

<hr><p>"Since all organisms inherit all their genes from their ancestors,
rather than from their ancestors' unsuccessful contemporaries, all
organisms tend to possess successful genes.&nbsp; They have what it takes
to become ancestors — and that means to survive and reproduce.&nbsp; This
is why organisms tend to inherit genes with a propensity to build a
well-designed machine — a body that actively works as if it is
striving to become an ancestor.&nbsp; That is why birds are so good at
flying, fish so good at swimming, monkeys so good at climbing,
viruses so good at spreading.&nbsp; That is why we love life and love sex
and love children.&nbsp; It is because we all, without a single exception,
inherit all of our genes from an unbroken line of successful
ancestors.&nbsp; The world becomes full of organisms that have what it
takes to become ancestors.&nbsp; That, in a sentence, is Darwinism."<br>
— Richard Dawkins, <i>River out of Eden</i>, p. 2<p>

"Natural selection is the blind watchmaker, blind because it does not see ahead, does not plan consequences, has no purpose in view.&nbsp; Yet
the living results of natural selection overwhelmingly impress us with the appearance of design as if by a master watchmaker,
impress us with the illusion of design and planning."<br>
- Richard Dawkins, <i>The Blind Watchmaker</i><p>

"Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist."<br>
— Richard Dawkins, ibid. p. 6<p>

"In fact, nothing in science as a whole has been more firmly established by interwoven factual information, or more illuminating than the
universal occurrence of biological evolution.&nbsp; Further, few natural processes have been more convincingly explained than
evolution by the theory of natural selection, or as it has been popularly called, Darwinism."<br>
- E.O. Wilson<p>

"Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge: it is those who know little, and not those
who know much, who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science."<br>
— Charles Darwin<p>

"The mystery of the beginning of all things is insoluble by us, and I for one must be content to remain an agnostic."<br>
— Charles Darwin, in <i>Life & Letters</i><p>

"I can indeed hardly see how anyone ought to wish Christianity to be true; for if so the plain language
of the text seems to show that the men who do not believe, and this would include my Father, Brother and
almost all my best friends, will be everlastingly punished.&nbsp; And that is a damnable doctrine."<br>
— Charles Darwin, Autobiography<p>

"That there is much suffering in the world no one disputes.&nbsp; Which is more likely, that pain and evil are the result
of an all-powerful and good God, or the product of uncaring natural forces?&nbsp; The presence of much suffering agrees
well with the view that all organic beings have been developed through variation and natural selection."<br>
— Charles Darwin<p>

"It appears to me (whether rightly or wrongly) that direct arguments against Christianity & theism produce hardly
any effect on the public; and freedom of thought is best promoted by the gradual illumination of men’s minds which
follow[s] from the advance of science."<br>
— Charles Darwin, 1880<p>
