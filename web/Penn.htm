			<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=3">
			Morning Edition</a>, </em></span><span class="date">November 21,
			2005 · </span>I believe that there is no God. I'm beyond
			Atheism. Atheism is not believing in God. Not believing in God
			is easy -- you can't prove a negative, so there's no work to do.
			You can't prove that there isn't an elephant inside the trunk of
			my car. You sure? How about now? Maybe he was just hiding
			before. Check again. Did I mention that my personal heartfelt
			definition of the word "elephant" includes mystery, order,
			goodness, love and a spare tire?</p>
			<p>So, anyone with a love for truth outside of herself has to
			start with no belief in God and then look for evidence of God.
			She needs to search for some objective evidence of a
			supernatural power. All the people I write e-mails to often are
			still stuck at this searching stage. The Atheism part is easy.
			</p>
			<p>But, this "This I Believe" thing seems to demand something
			more personal, some leap of faith that helps one see life's big
			picture, some rules to live by. So, I'm saying, "This I believe:
			I believe there is no God." </p>
			<p>Having taken that step, it informs every moment of my life.
			I'm not greedy. I have love, blue skies, rainbows and Hallmark
			cards, and that has to be enough. It has to be enough, but it's
			everything in the world and everything in the world is plenty
			for me. It seems just rude to beg the invisible for more. Just
			the love of my family that raised me and the family I'm raising
			now is enough that I don't need heaven. I won the huge genetic
			lottery and I get joy every day. </p>
			<p>Believing there's no God means I can't really be forgiven
			except by kindness and faulty memories. That's good; it makes me
			want to be more thoughtful. I have to try to treat people right
			the first time around. </p>
			<p>Believing there's no God stops me from being solipsistic. I
			can read ideas from all different people from all different
			cultures. Without God, we can agree on reality, and I can keep
			learning where I'm wrong. We can all keep adjusting, so we can
			really communicate. I don't travel in circles where people say,
			"I have faith, I believe this in my heart and nothing you can
			say or do can shake my faith." That's just a long-winded
			religious way to say, "shut up," or another two words that the
			FCC likes less. But all obscenity is less insulting than, "How I
			was brought up and my imaginary friend means more to me than
			anything you can ever say or do." So, believing there is no God
			lets me be proven wrong and that's always fun. It means I'm
			learning something. </p>
			<p>Believing there is no God means the suffering I've seen in my
			family, and indeed all the suffering in the world, isn't caused
			by an omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent force that isn't
			bothered to help or is just testing us, but rather something we
			all may be able to help others with in the future. No God means
			the possibility of less suffering in the future. </p>
			<p>Believing there is no God gives me more room for belief in
			family, people, love, truth, beauty, sex, Jell-o and all the
			other things I can prove and that make this life the best life I
			will ever have.</p>
