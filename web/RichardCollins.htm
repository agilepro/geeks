<h2>President is now viewed as untrustworthy</h2>

President Bush, it is widely reported, rode to victory in the 2000 election
largely based on his self avowed capacity for being straight with Americans.
His strategy seems to have worked for most of his time in office, but now
with all the revelations coming out about his administration's handling of
the runup to the Iraq war, unsupervised survelliance, and the politically
inspired leaks coming out of the White House, the polls show he is in serious
political trouble.&nbsp; Witness his approval rating, which has been in steady
decline for several months.<p>

What is more ominous and what should alarm him (and Carl Rove) is that most
polls reveal that a majority of Americans no longer believe he is
trustworthy.&nbsp; What seemed to be his stongest trump card, is now in tatters.
Why?&nbsp; Is his belief in faith to blame?<p>

Can a born again fundamentalist realy understand what it means to be honest?
Honesty demands a world view that places a high value on objectivity and as
much as possible recognizing and eliminating personal biases -- on
questioning everything.&nbsp; Fundamentalists do not prize self examination
because that could lead to penatrating questions their faith leaders would
not welcome.&nbsp; Can anyone seriously imagine Jerry Falwell or Pat Robertson
leading a Socratic search for the truth about, say evolution?<p>

Instead, fundamentalists preach loyalty to the dogma contained in their holy
text.&nbsp; They believe they answer to a "higher power" and the dictates of this
higher power are all spelled out for them.&nbsp; They just need to choose the
right verses from their holy text and they can justify their position on
anything or answer any question big or small.&nbsp; No honest person would say
this is the attitude of an objective human being.&nbsp; What is more, this
reliance on dogma all but guarantees you cannot hold an honest discussion
with a fundamentalist.&nbsp; They already have all the answers -- no need for
tedious debate.<p>

President Bush cannot claim he is a "straight shooter" and we should not
believe him.&nbsp; Will his reliance on dogma be his undoing?&nbsp; He is a very
dangerous man.<p>
