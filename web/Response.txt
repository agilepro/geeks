> You had better turn form your ways and see God.  The true and living.  See, he still loves you even if you don't acknowledge him.  But when you are gone from this place; it will be too late.  He will not acknowledge you in the end if you do not acknowledge him know.  You will not be with you friends and love ones who accept Christ as their Lord and savior.  You will burn eternally in Hell and it will be too late for you to be saved.

Hello Melonie,

Thank you for your concern about my future.  It's nice to know that your kind, loving god threatens me with eternal pain and damnation if I don't acknowledge him/she/it.  Of course, it would help if this all-knowing sky god would give me some real evidence of its existence. I've looked at all the evidence that has been put forth to supposedly prove this god's existence, and it all fails badly.  Your god can't even put together a coherent book.  Until there's some verifiable evidence, your god has as much reality as the other 2500 gods that humankind has invented.

If you want to play in fantasy-land, that's fine.  But it's not polite to threaten others, even with make-believe gods.

If you are interested in understanding the real world, there are many books and web sites to read.  We've collected a good assortment at www.godlessgeeks.com

Sincerely,
Mark

You obviously did not understand what I wrote.  There's NO RELIABLE, EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE that this sky god of yours exists.  There have been over 2500 gods invented by humankind.  Your god has as much reliable evidence as the rest.  The bible that you quote from is full of inconsistencies and killings, contradicts itself, and is largly a work of fiction.

If you want the history of what Christianity is, study the old religion of Mithraism.  It had a savior that was born around the winter solstice.  He died and came back to life and ascended into heaven.  Mithraism also started in Tarsus, the home of Saul/Paul.  Much of his writings became the basis for Christianity.

If you think that threats of a hell afterlife are sufficient reason for believing, then read about "Pascal's Wager" for further insights.  Threatening people with a make-believe god is just not polite.

Religion is just a tool for controlling the masses, and you are being controlled as much as any marionette.

All this is asking you to actually think and look at the real evidence.  I doubt that you will be able to, because the virus of religion has so infected your mind.  Religion is largely an emotional issue, so I don't think that rational concepts will influence your thoughts.  Change and growth are painful.

Sincerely,
Mark




Hello Bill,

For the 10 commandments, look at Exodus 34.  Below is the King James Version.  It specifically says "ten commandments."  Do you agree with them?

Relating to the supposed existence of Jesus, just because a text is centuries old does not make it true.  There are old texts that relate to many characters that we know are fictional.  My basic premise is that the character of Jesus was partially or totally fabricated in the first few centuries C.E.  There is no reliable historic document that proves that Jesus ever existed.  If you would like an interesting bit of research, study the old religion of Mithraism, which was popular about 2000 years ago.  It had a savior that was born around the winter solstice.  He died and came back to life and ascended into heaven.  Mithraism also started in Tarsus, the home of Saul/Paul.  Much of his writings became the basis for Christianity.

As for proof of the fallibility of the bible, there are at least three paths - morality, internal consistency, and external consistency.

Morality: the bible is filled with many events, statements, and moralities that were condoned by its god.  Some were good, and some were not (in my judgment).  Do you agree with all of this god's actions and statements?  Do you think that slavery is wrong?  I do.  The god of the bible thinks that it is quite acceptable.  Do you think that it is right to punish great grandchildren for the crimes of their ancestors?  I don't. The biblical god does (see Exodus 34:7, below).  Do you think that the biblical slaughters carried out with his approval were moral?  I don't.  Do you think that it is acceptable to kill a person or animal because you don't like what other people have done, and will do.  I don't.  The god of the bible thinks that it is good.  So, apparently, do most Christians.  For many other bible atrocities, see http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/donald_morgan/atrocity.shtml

Internal Consistency: There are many inconsistencies in the bible.  This list has many:

External Consistency: See

As for love, I see no reason why it has anything to do with a god.  We all have emotions (as do higher level animals); they are necessary for the survival of our species.

I have examined your suggestions, and find them lacking.  As a counterpoint, I suggest that you pray daily for a week, with an open heart to the Cosmic Star Goat ( http://www.cosmicstargoat.com/ )  Perhaps you will find a new god.  You will probably find this idea pointless.  I also find your idea pointless.  For further insight into my logic, you can read my talk on Atheism at
http://www.godlessgeeks.com/WhyAtheism.htm

I ask you for empirical evidence that this god of yours is not a mass hallucination.  I ask you for empirical evidence that yours is the right god, and that all other gods are false.

As for disproof of the Christian god, I say that this god is logically inconsistent -- like a square circle.  Here is some of what I wrote in my talk on Atheism:

Ultimately though, it’s not necessary to prove that God doesn’t exist.  It is up to the God believers to prove that their god or gods exist, for they are making the assertion of the existence of something that is not immediately visible.  For example, if I were to claim that there is an invisible ten-foot tall pink unicorn in this room, and demand that you feed it, you could justifiably expect some sort of hard proof.  The same concept of proof lies with those who claim that an invisible, immaterial god exists.  Thus, even if all proofs of the nonexistence of God were to fail, it would still be necessary for theists to prove the actual existence of this god, if they expect us to take them seriously.

Some people say that we can’t prove that the Christian god doesn’t exist, that we have to have absolute knowledge.  This is wrong.  Depending on how we define a god, it is possible to prove that it doesn’t exist, just like it is possible to prove that square circles don’t exist.  The god of Abraham is typically defined as having free will, and being all-knowing, all-powerful, all-good and eternal.

This sounds pretty good.  Unfortunately these attributes are mutually exclusive and can’t all exist in one being, no matter how supernatural it is.  God can’t have free will and be all-knowing and all-powerful.  If God knows the future, God would be unable to change it, and thus could not have free will.  As a simple example, let’s say that God declares what tomorrow’s winning lottery numbers will be, and writes them down.  However, now God can’t change those numbers.  God can’t both know the future and change it.

God also can’t be both all-good and all-powerful, because terrible events really do occur, and this all-loving god hasn’t prevented them.  This is known as the problem of evil, and I think that it is one of the biggest problems for those attempting to prove the existence of God.  How can anybody explain the existence of a loving, all-powerful god, while also knowing the bad things that happen to all of us?

The ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus summed it up well when he wrote these ideas:
     Either God wants to abolish evil, and cannot; or he can and does not want to.
     If he wants to, but cannot, he is impotent.
     If he can, but does not want to, he is wicked.
     If, as they say, God can abolish evil, and God really wants to do it, why is there evil in the world?


Sincerely,
Mark Thomas
