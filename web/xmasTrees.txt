On the issue of xmas trees, I think that trying to ban them from the public square is an unwinnable issue - and makes us look like grinches.  I think that working to call them Solstice Trees, and not allowing religious decorations on those in the public square, is a better tactic.  This would also continually remind the xtians of the true reason for the season.
