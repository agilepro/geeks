<p align="justify"><b>In December 1998 I wrote a very brief overview of the
amount of killing and suffering caused by the world's religions. I mentioned the
Crusades, the Inquisitions, Northern Ireland, the "ethnic" (read:
religious) cleansing in Bosnia, the Holocaust, the Salem Witch Trials, the
Thirty Years' War, and I made a brief reference to the Aztecs' human sacrifices.
With what's happening today I think it's time to update and expand on that list.
And the next time someone tries to point out to you how religion brings out the
best in us, you might want show them a printout of this.<br>
</b>
<ul>
 <li>
   <p align="justify"><b>The Aztecs were not alone, although they were the
   undisputed champions, murdering 20,000 victims each year to appease their
   gods. Religious human sacrifice was carried out in ancient Phoenicia, Gaul,
   Tibet, Africa (the Ashanti), and Borneo. The Mayans and Incas also regularly
   sacrificed humans to their gods, the Incas executing as many as 200 children
   at once during major ceremonies.<br>
   <br>
   </b></p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p align="justify"><b>In Alexandria in the year 415, the great female
   scientist and head of the Alexandria Library, Hypatia, was beaten to death
   by Catholic monks who considered her scientific work heretical.<br>
   <br>
   </b></p>
 <li>
   <p align="justify"><b>Since the 7th century the number of people killed in
   "jihads" or "holy" wars waged by various factions of
   Islam can only be vaguely guessed at. Several million would not be out of
   the question, and the number is increasing as this is being written.<br>
   <br>
   </b></p>
 <li>
   <p align="justify"><b>In 1095 when Pope Urban II launched the first Crusade
   to take the Holy Land from the Muslims, the German Crusaders decided to
   first "kill the infidels among us" and slaughtered thousands of
   German Jews on the way to the Holy Land. The same thing happened to Jews in
   Prague, massacred by Christian Crusaders.<br>
   <br>
   </b></p>
 <li>
   <p align="justify"><b>In 1208 Pope Innocent III decreed that a Catholic sect
   known as the Albigenses should be destroyed, all murdered, because they held
   heretical views such as the idea that Jesus was only an angel. The Crusading
   soldiers swept through southern France searching for these heretics. When
   they got to the city of Beziers, that was known to host many of the
   Albigenses, they asked a papal representative how they could distinguish the
   heretics from the truly faithful. The answer: "Kill them all. God will
   know His own."<br>
   <br>
   </b></p>
 <li>
   <p align="justify"><b>In the 14th century tens of thousands of Jews were
   killed by Christians for "causing" the Black Death (bubonic
   plague). Reason? Because so many Jews survived the plague. Reason? Probably
   the Jewish rituals that include weekly cleansing of the body and changing
   into clean clothes.<br>
   <br>
   </b></p>
 <li>
   <p align="justify"><b>In the 1500s when the Spanish invaded the Americas
   they brought the Inquisition with them. Demanding "instant"
   conversion to Catholicism from all the native inhabitants, backsliders were
   naturally common. And they were then killed by the Inquisition.<br>
   <br>
   </b></p>
 <li>
   <p align="justify"><b>Thousands of Protestants fled France to avoid
   persecution and some of them ended up in what is now St. Augustine, Florida.
   In 1565 Catholic Spaniards discovered one such colony and killed almost
   every single person there. They then erected a sign that said the people had
   been executed "not as Frenchmen but as Lutherans."<br>
   <br>
   </b></p>
 <li>
   <p align="justify"><b>On August 24, 1572, in France, the Catholics murdered
   thousands of Protestants in a single bloody day. It came to be known as the
   St. Bartholomew Day massacre.<br>
   <br>
   </b></p>
 <li>
   <p align="justify"><b>In the 17th century the Church of England tried to
   eliminate the Puritans, using torture and sometimes hanging to achieve their
   ends. Then Oliver Cromwell, a Puritan, rose to power and led the Puritans
   into a backlash, resulting in civil war. When Cromwell died there was a
   backlash against Puritans again and Cromwell's body was exhumed, hanged and
   then decapitated. Death toll uncertain.<br>
   <br>
   </b></p>
 <li>
   <p align="justify"><b>On July 1, 1766, in Abbeville, France, a teenage boy
   was decapitated for singing irreligious songs, marring a crucifix, mocking
   the Virgin Mary, and refusing to remove his hat when a religious procession
   passed. *<br>
   <br>
   </b></p>
 <li>
   <p align="justify"><b>Up until the 1800s the Hindus in India sacrificed a
   male child every Friday evening for the goddess Kali. Other Kali followers
   killed an estimated 2 million people over 300 years.<br>
   <br>
   </b></p>
 <li>
   <p align="justify"><b>In the mid-1800s a Buddhist king in Burma ordered 500
   people to be sacrificed to "sanctify" the new city walls of
   Mandalay.<br>
   <br>
   </b></p>
 <li>
   <p align="justify"><b>In 1857 the East India Company incautiously armed
   themselves with rifle cartridges that were greased with animal fat. This
   enraged both Muslims and Hindus, the former finding pigs to be evil and the
   latter considering cows to be holy. Violence broke out leaving thousands
   dead.<br>
   <br>
   </b></p>
 <li>
   <p align="justify"><b>In 1915 Christian Armenians and Turkish Muslims waged
   war on each other leaving an estimated 3 million dead.<br>
   <br>
   </b></p>
 <li>
   <p align="justify"><b>Beginning in 1955 in the Sudan, Muslims and Christians
   waged a "holy" war lasting seventeen years and killing a half
   million people. In 1983 the same war flared up again, this time with the
   final result of one million dead in 24 years.<br>
   <br>
   </b></p>
 <li>
   <p align="justify"><b>Up until 1965 the Roman Catholic Church's liturgy
   contained the words, "…and protect us from the perfidious Jews."
   In the Church's history scores of thousands of Jews were killed for (1)
   Murdering Christian children and drinking their blood; and (2)
   "Host-Nailing" meaning that they stole the communion wafers that
   represented the body of Jesus and drove nails through them, thereby
   crucifying Jesus a second time. [I am not making this up.]<br>
   <br>
   </b></p>
 <li>
   <p align="justify"><b>In the fifty years of Israel's existence, over 3,000
   Israelis died as a result of Muslim suicide bombers, thousands more during
   various wars, and the religious clashes between Israeli Jews and Palestinian
   Muslims continue to this day, as does the dying-on both sides.<br>
   <br>
   </b></p>
 <li>
   <p align="justify"><b>In 1978 more than 900 people of the religious group,
   the Peoples Temple, died as victims of suicide/murders at their own hands,
   in Jonestown in Guyana, South America.<br>
   <br>
   </b></p>
 <li>
   <p align="justify"><b>In the 1980s Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini ruled by means
   of cruel torture and killings. Secrecy surrounds the number of victims, but
   thousands are certainly dead because of his religious oppression.<br>
   <br>
   </b></p>
 <li>
   <p align="justify"><b>In 1980 at Moradabad, India, a riot broke out between
   Muslims and Hindus because the former believed the latter had intentionally
   driven a pig to walk over Muslim holy ground. 200 died.<br>
   <br>
   </b></p>
 <li>
   <p align="justify"><b>In the 1980s Iran's Shi'ite theocracy killed around
   200 Baha'i believers who would not convert to Islam.<br>
   <br>
   </b></p>
 <li>
   <p align="justify"><b>In 1993 a secretive religious cult, the Branch
   Dividians, led by David Koresh, armed themselves to the teeth and fought
   with Federal Agents, leaving 83 dead in Waco, Texas.<br>

 <li>
   <p align="justify"><b>On June 17, 1993, a six-year-old girl died after being
   struck by a moving train in Dania, Florida. She was thrown 20 feet and
   suffered a broken neck. Her brother had pushed her to safety, but she rushed
   back onto the tracks to die so she could be in heaven, waiting for her
   terminally ill mother. [AP]<br>

   attacked and set fire to two Christian chapels in an ongoing religious
   struggle. [Reuters]<font size=4><br>
   <br>
   </font>On October 28, 2000, in <font color="#000000">Nablus on the West
   Bank, an angry mob of Muslims ripped up Jewish prayer books and stomped on
   their sacred scrolls, protesting their right to be on the West Bank. [<i>The
   Washington Post</i>]<br>

   <p align="justify"><b><font color="#000000">On September 11, 2001 nineteen
   Muslims flew two jumbo jets into the World Trade Center, one into the
   Pentagon, and a fourth one crashed, leaving over 3,000 dead. This act was to
   please Allah and achieve Paradise by killing "Infidels."<br>
   </font></b>
   <p align="justify"><b><font color="#000000">This year, 2002, we all learned
   the horrific scale of a problem that we had always known existed in the
   Roman Catholic Church-pedophilia. Now and again we'd read about priests
   raping young boys, but the extent of the obscenity was hidden from most of
   us by a vile, crass, CYA policy followed by Cardinals and Bishops all over
   the USA. They just moved the rapists from one diocese to another and/or paid
   off the victims' families so they'd keep silent about it. Making it worse is
   the callous attitude shown by the American Bishops and Cardinals summoned to
   Rome to consider the outrages. They used words like "offenders"
   and "mistakes" and other weasel words, as if they had been caught
   with their hands in a cookie jar instead of molesting children. Those
   priests are <i>not</i> offenders. They are criminals and should be treated
   as such. This abomination should have been addressed decades ago. But of
   course Popes have other things to think about in their busy world.<br>

   his weekly general audience in front of 50,000 in St. Peter's Square, Pope
   John Paul II gave thanks to 2,000 pizzamakers gathered from around the world
   to celebrate World Pizzamakers' Day. "We appreciate so much your
   professional work," said the 80-year-old Pope. "I pray for your
   families and your particular profession," he added. [Reuters]</font></b></p>
