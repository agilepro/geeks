<b>Here's the transcript:</b><br>
"I get amazed, I can't look at it but about 10 seconds, at
these politicians dancing around this, dancing around this, I'm trying to
find a correct name for it, this utter absolute, asinine, idiotic stupidity of
men marrying men."&nbsp; (shouts from crowd)<p>
"I've never seen a man in my life I
wanted to marry."&nbsp; (shouts, applause) "And I'm gonna be blunt and plain, if
one ever looks at me like that I'm gonna kill him and tell God he died."
(laughter, applause) "In case anybody doesn't know, God calls it an
abomnation (sic).&nbsp; It's an abomnation (sic)!&nbsp; It's an abomnation (sic)!"&nbsp; (applause)<p>
"These ridiculous, utterly absurd district attorneys and judges and state congress
and 'well, we don't know'... they ought to, they ought to, they ought to have to marry a pig
and live with them forever."&nbsp; (laughter) "I'm not knocking the poor homosexual, I'm not.
They need salvation just like anybody else.&nbsp; I'm knocking our pitiful, pathetic
lawmakers.&nbsp; And I thank God that President Bush has stated," (applause) "we
need a Constitutional amendment that states that marriage is between a man
and a woman."&nbsp; (applause)<p>

<h2 align=center>Evangelist Swaggart Apologizes for Remark</h2>
BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Evangelist Jimmy Swaggart apologized
Wednesday for saying in a televised worship service that he would
kill any gay man who looked at him romantically.<p>
A complaint was filed with a Canadian broadcasting group, and
Swaggart said his Baton Rouge-based Jimmy Swaggart Ministries has
received complaints from gay groups over the remarks made on the
Sept. 12 telecast.<p>

In the broadcast, Swaggart was discussing his opposition to gay
marriage when he said "I've never seen a man in my life I wanted to
marry."<p>
"And I'm going to be blunt and plain: If one ever looks at me like
that, I'm going to kill him and tell God he died," Swaggart said to
laughter and applause from the congregation.<p>
On Wednesday, Swaggart said he has jokingly used the
expression "killing someone and telling God he died" thousands of
times, about all sorts of people. He said the expression is
figurative and not meant to harm.<p>
"It's a humorous statement that doesn't mean anything. You can't lie
to God - it's ridiculous," Swaggart told The Associated Press. "If
it's an insult, I certainly didn't think it was, but if they are
offended, then I certainly offer an apology."<p>

<b>Here's the commentary:</b><br>
Cheryl Jacques, head of the Washington, D.C.-based Human Rights
Campaign, which represents homosexuals, bisexuals and transgendered
people, said Swaggart should preach equality for all Americans.<p>
"Apologies don't discourage violence - action does. We hope that he
takes action," Jacques said. "His language only encourages an
environment where hate crimes occur."<p>
Swaggart was a popular television evangelist during the 1980s until
a 1987 sex scandal involving a prostitute that he met in a seedy New
Orleans motel. Swaggart never confessed to anything more than an
unspecified sin. A few years later, he was stopped by police while
driving in California with a suspected prostitute in his car.<p>
