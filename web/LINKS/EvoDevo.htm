<p>Since its humble beginnings as a single cell, life
has evolved into a spectacular array of shapes and
sizes, from tiny fleas to towering Tyrannosaurus rex,
from slow-soaring vultures to fast-swimming swordfish,
and from modest ferns to alluring orchids. But just how
such diversity of form could arise out of evolution’s
mess of random genetic mutations — how a functional wing
could sprout where none had grown before, or how flowers
could blossom in what had been a flowerless world — has
remained one of the most fascinating and intractable
questions in evolutionary biology.

<p>Now finally, after more than a century of puzzling,
scientists are finding answers coming fast and furious
and from a surprising quarter, the field known as
evo-devo. Just coming into its own as a science,
evo-devo is the combined study of evolution and
development, the process by which a nubbin of a
fertilized egg transforms into a full-fledged adult. And
what these scientists are finding is that development, a
process that has for more than half a century been
largely ignored in the study of evolution, appears to
have been one of the major forces shaping the history of
life on earth.
<p>For starters, evo-devo researchers are finding that
the evolution of complex new forms, rather than
requiring many new mutations or many new genes as had
long been thought, can instead be accomplished by a much
simpler process requiring no more than tweaks to already
existing genes and developmental plans. Stranger still,
researchers are finding that the genes that can be
tweaked to create new shapes and body parts are
surprisingly few. The same <a
href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/geneticsandheredity/index.html>
DNA</a> sequences are turning out to be the spark
inciting one evolutionary flowering after another. “Do
these discoveries blow people’s minds? Yes,” said Dr.
Sean B. Carroll, biologist at the Howard Hughes Medical
Institute at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. “The first
response is ‘Huh?’ and the second response is ‘Far out.’”
<p>“This is the illumination of the utterly dark,” Dr. Carroll added.

<p>The development of an organism — how one end gets
designated as the head or the tail, how feet are enticed
to grow at the end of a leg rather than at the wrist —
is controlled by a hierarchy of genes, with master genes
at the top controlling a next tier of genes, controlling
a next and so on. But the real interest for evolutionary
biologists is that these hierarchies not only favor the
evolution of certain forms but also disallow the growth
of others, determining what can and cannot arise not
only in the course of the growth of an embryo, but also
over the history of life itself.
<p>“It’s been said that classical evolutionary theory
looks at survival of the fittest,” said Dr. Scott F.
Gilbert, a developmental biologist at Swarthmore
College. By looking at what sorts of organisms are most
likely or impossible to develop, he explained, “evo-devo
looks at the arrival of the fittest.”
<p>Charles Darwin saw it first. He pointed out well over
a century ago that developing forms of life would be
central to the study of evolution. Little came of it
initially, for a variety of reasons. Not least of these
was the discovery that perturbing the process of
development often resulted in a freak show starring
horrors like bipedal goats and insects with legs growing
out of their mouths, monstrosities that seemed to shed
little light on the wonders of evolution.

<p><br>
<p>But the advent of molecular biology reinvigorated the
study of development in the 1980s, and evo-devo quickly
got scientists’ attention when early breakthroughs
revealed that the same master genes were laying out
fundamental body plans and parts across the animal
kingdom. For example, researchers discovered that genes
in the Pax6 family could switch on the development of
eyes in animals as different as flies and people. More
recent work has begun looking beyond the body’s basic
building blocks to reveal how changes in development
have resulted in some of the world’s most celebrated of
evolutionary events.
<p>In one of the most exciting of the new studies, a
team of scientists led by Dr. Cliff Tabin, a
developmental biologist at Harvard Medical School,
investigated a classic example of evolution by natural
selection, the evolution of Darwin’s finches on the
Galápagos Islands.
<p>Like the other organisms that made it to the remote
archipelago off the coast of Ecuador, Darwin’s finches
have flourished in their isolation, evolving into many
and varied species. But, while the finches bear his name
and while Darwin was indeed inspired to thoughts of
evolution by animals on these islands, the finches left
him flummoxed. Darwin did not realize for quite some
time that these birds were all finches or even that they
were related to one another.

<p></tr><tr>
<td class="caption" bgColor="#cccccc">How Darwin’s Finches Grew Their Beaks</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
<p>He should be forgiven, however. For while the species
are descendants of an original pioneering finch, they no
longer bear its characteristic short, slender beak,
which is excellent for hulling tiny seeds. In fact, the
finches no longer look very finchlike at all. Adapting
to the strange new foods of the islands, some have
evolved taller, broader, more powerful nut-cracking
beaks; the most impressive of the big-beaked finches is
Geospiza magnirostris. Other finches have evolved longer
bills that are ideal for drilling holes into cactus
fruits to get at the seeds; Geospiza conirostris is one
species with a particularly elongated beak.
<p>But how could such bills evolve from a simple finch
beak? Scientists had assumed that the dramatic
alterations in beak shape, height, width and strength
would require the accumulation of many chance mutations
in many different genes. But evo-devo has revealed that
getting a fancy new beak can be simpler than anyone had imagined.
<p>Genes are stretches of DNA that can be switched on so
that they will produce molecules known as proteins.
Proteins can then do a number of jobs in the cell or
outside it, working to make parts of organisms,
switching other genes on and so on. When genes are
switched on to produce proteins, they can do so at a low
level in a limited area or they can crank out lots of
protein in many cells.

<p>What Dr. Tabin and colleagues found, when looking at
the range of beak shapes and sizes across different
finch species, was that the thicker and taller and more
robust a beak, the more strongly it expressed a gene
known as BMP4 early in development. The BMP4 gene (its
abbreviation stands for bone morphogenetic protein, No.
4) produces the BMP4 protein, which can signal cells to
begin producing bone. But BMP4 is multitalented and can
also act to direct early development, laying out a
variety of architectural plans including signaling which
part of the embryo is to be the backside and which the
belly side. To verify that the BMP4 gene itself could
indeed trigger the growth of grander, bigger,
nut-crushing beaks, researchers artificially cranked up
the production of BMP4 in the developing beaks of
chicken embryos. The chicks began growing wider, taller,
more robust beaks similar to those of a nut-cracking finch.

<p>In the finches with long, probing beaks, researchers
found at work a different gene, known as calmodulin. As
with BMP4, the more that calmodulin was expressed, the
longer the beak became. When scientists artificially
increased calmodulin in chicken embryos, the chicks
began growing extended beaks, just like a cactus driller.
<p>So, with just these two genes, not tens or hundreds,
the scientists found the potential to recreate beaks,
massive or stubby or elongated.
<p>“So now one wants to go in a number of directions,”
Dr. Tabin said. “What happens in a stork? What happens
in a hummingbird? A parrot?” For the evolution of beaks,
the main tool with which a bird handles its food and
makes its living, is central not only to Darwin’s
finches, but to birds as a whole.
<p>BMP4’s reach does not stop at the birds, however.
<p>In lakes in Africa, the fish known as cichlids have
evolved so rapidly into such a huge diversity of species
that they have become one of the best known evolutionary
radiations. The cichlids have evolved in different
shapes and sizes, and with a variety of jaw types
specialized for eating certain kinds of food. Robust,
thick jaws are excellent at crushing snails, while
longer jaws work well for sucking up algae. As with the
beaks of finches, a range of styles developed.
<p>Now in a new study, Dr. R. Craig Albertson, an
evolutionary biologist at
Syracuse University, and Dr. Thomas D. Kocher, a
geneticist at the University of New Hampshire, have shown that more
robust-jawed cichlids express more BMP4 during
development than those with more delicate jaws. To test
whether BMP4 was indeed responsible for the difference,
these scientists artificially increased the expression
of BMP4 in the zebrafish, the lab rat of the fish world.
And, reprising the beak experiments, researchers found
that increased production of BMP4 in the jaws of
embryonic zebrafish led to the development of more
robust chewing and chomping parts.
<p>And if being a major player in the evolution of
African cichlids and Darwin’s finches — two of the most
famous evolutionary radiations of species — were not
enough for BMP4, Dr. Peter R. Grant, an evolutionary
biologist at
Princeton University, predicted that the gene would
probably be found to play an important role in the
evolution of still other animals. He noted that jaw
changes were a crucial element in the evolution of
lizards, rabbits and mice, among others, making them
prime candidates for evolution via BMP4.
<p>“This is just the beginning,” Dr. Grant said. “These
are exciting times for us all.”
<p>Used to lay out body plans, build beaks and alter
fish jaws, BMP4 illustrates perfectly one of the major
recurring themes of evo-devo. New forms can arise via
new uses of existing genes, in particular the control
genes or what are sometimes called toolkit genes that
oversee development. It is a discovery that can explain
much that has previously been mysterious, like the
observation that without much obvious change to the
genome over all, one can get fairly radical changes in form.
<p>“There aren’t new genes arising every time a new
species arises,” said Dr. Brian K. Hall, a developmental
biologist at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia.
“Basically you take existing genes and processes and
modify them, and that’s why humans and chimps can be 99
percent similar at the genome level.”
<p>Evo-devo has also begun to shine a light on a
phenomenon with which evolutionary biologists have long
been familiar, the way in which different species will
come up with sometimes jaw-droppingly similar solutions
when confronted with the same challenges.
<p>Among the placental mammals of the Americas and the
marsupials of Australia, for example, have evolved the
same sorts of animals independently: beasts that
burrowed, loping critters that grazed, creatures that
had long snouts for eating ants, and versions of wolf.
<p>In the same way, the cichlids have evolved pairs of
matching species, arising independently in separate
lakes in Africa. In Lake Malawi, for example, there is a
long and flat-headed species with a deep underbite that
looks remarkably like an unrelated species that lives a
similar lifestyle in Lake Tanganyika. There is another
cichlid with a bulging brow and frowning lips in Lake
Malawi with, again, an unrelated but otherwise extremely
similar-looking cichlid in Lake Tanganyika. The same
jaws, heads, and ways of living can be seen to evolve
again and again.
<p>The findings of evo-devo suggest that such parallels
might in fact be expected. For cichlids are hardly
coming up with new genetic solutions to eating tough
snails as they each crank up the BMP4 or tinker with
other toolkit genes. Instead, whether in Lake Malawi or
Lake Tanganyika, they may be using the same genes to
develop the same forms that provide the same solutions
to the same ecological challenges. Why not, when even
the beaked birds flying overhead are using the very same
genes?
<p>Evo-devo has even begun to give biologists new
insight into one of the most beautiful examples of
recurring forms: the evolution of mimicry.
<p>It has long been a source of amazement how some
species seem so able to evolve near-perfect mimicry of
another. Poisonous species often evolve bright warning
colors, which have been reproduced by nonpoisonous
species or by other, similarly poisonous species, hoping
to fend off curious predators.
<p>Now in a new study of Heliconius butterflies, Dr.
Mathieu Joron, an evolutionary biologist at the
University of Edinburgh, and colleagues, found evidence
that the mimics may be using some of the same genes to
produce their copycat warning colors and patterns.
<p>The researchers studied several species of tropical
Heliconius butterflies, all of which are nasty-tasting
to birds and which mimic one another’s color patterns.
Dr. Joron and colleagues found that some of the main
elements of the patterns — a yellow band in Heliconius
melpomene and Heliconius erato and a complex
tiger-stripe pattern in Heliconius numata — are
controlled by a single region of DNA, a tightly linked
set of genes known as a supergene.
<p>Dr. Joron said he and colleagues were still mapping
the details of color pattern control within the
supergene. But if this turned out to function, as
researchers suspected, like a toolkit gene turning the
patterns on and off, it could explain both the
prevalence of mimicry in Heliconius and the apparent
ease with which these species have been shown to
repeatedly evolve such superbly matching patterns.
<p>One of evo-devo’s greatest strengths is its
cross-disciplinary nature, bridging not only
evolutionary and developmental studies but gaps as broad
as those between fossil-hunting paleontologists and
molecular biologists. One researcher whose approach
epitomizes the power of such synthesis is Dr. Neil
Shubin, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Chicago and the Field Museum.
<p>Last year, Dr. Shubin and colleagues reported the
discovery of a fossil fish on Ellesmere Island in
northern Canada. They had found Tiktaalik, as they named
the fish, after searching for six years. They persisted
for so long because they were certain that they had
found the right age and kind of rock where a fossil of a
fish trying to make the transition to life on land was
likely to be found. And Tiktaalik appeared to be just
such a fish, but it also had a few surprises for the
researchers.
<p>“Tiktaalik is special,” Dr. Shubin said. “It has a
flat head with eyes on top. It has gills and lungs. It’s
an animal that’s exploring the interface between water
and land.”
<p>But Tiktaalik was a truly stunning discovery because
this water-loving fish bore wrists, an attribute thought
to have been an innovation confined strictly to animals
that had already made the transition to land.
<p>“This was telling us that a piece of the toolkit, to
make arms, legs, hand and feet, could very well be
present in fish limbs,” Dr. Shubin said. In other words,
the genetic tools or toolkit genes for making limbs to
walk on land might well have been present long before
fish made that critical leap. But as fascinating as
Tiktaalik was, it was also rock hard and provided no DNA
that might shed light on the presence or absence of any
particular gene.
<p>So Dr. Shubin did what more and more evo-devo
researchers are learning to do: take off one hat
(paleontologist) and don another (molecular biologist).
Dr. Shubin oversees one of what he says is a small but
growing number of laboratories where old-fashioned
rock-pounding takes place alongside high-tech molecular
DNA studies.
<p>He and colleagues began a study of the living but
ancient fish known as the paddlefish. What they found,
reported last month in the journal Nature, was that
these thoroughly fishy fish were turning on control
genes known as Hox genes, in a manner characteristic of
the four-limbed, land-loving beasts known as tetrapods.
<p>Tetrapods include cows, people, birds, rodents and so
on. In other words, the potential for making fingers,
hands and feet, crucial innovations used in emerging
from the water to a life of walking and crawling on
land, appears to have been present in fish, long before
they began flip-flopping their way out of the muck. “The
genetic tools to build fingers and toes were in place
for a long time,” Dr. Shubin wrote in an e-mail message.
“Lacking were the environmental conditions where these
structures would be useful.” He added, “Fingers arose
when the right environments arose.”
<p>And here is another of the main themes to emerge from
evo-devo. Major events in evolution like the transition
from life in the water to life on land are not
necessarily set off by the arising of the genetic
mutations that will build the required body parts, or
even the appearance of the body parts themselves, as had
long been assumed. Instead, it is theorized that the
right ecological situation, the right habitat in which
such bold, new forms will prove to be particularly
advantageous, may be what is required to set these major
transitions in motion.
<p>So far, most of the evo-devo work has been on
animals, but researchers have begun to ask whether the
same themes are being played out in plants.
<p>Of particular interest to botanists is what Darwin
described as an “abominable mystery”: the origin of
flowering plants. A critical event in the evolution of
plants, it happened, by paleontological standards,
rather suddenly.
<p>So what genes were involved in the origin of flowers?
Botanists know that during development, the genes known
as MADS box genes lay out the architecture of the
blossom. They do so by turning on other genes, thereby
determining what will develop where — petals here,
reproductive parts there and so on, in much the same
manner that Hox genes determine the general layout of
parts in animals. Hox genes have had an important role
in the evolution of animal form. But have MADS box genes
had as central a role in the evolution of plants?
<p>So far, said Dr. Vivian F. Irish, a developmental
biologist at Yale University, the answer appears to be yes. There
is a variety of circumstantial evidence, the most
interesting of which is the fact that the MADS box genes
exploded in number right around the time that flowering
plants first appeared.
<p>“It’s really analogous to what’s going on in Hox
genes,” said Dr. Irish, though she noted that details of
the role of the MADS box genes remained to be worked
out. “It’s very cool that evolution has used a similar
strategy in two very different kingdoms.”
<p>Amid the enthusiast hubbub, cautionary notes have
been sounded. Dr. Jerry Coyne, an evolutionary biologist
at the University of Chicago, said that as dramatic as
the changes in form caused by mutations in toolkit genes
can be, it was premature to credit these genes with
being the primary drivers of the evolution of novel
forms and diversity. He said that too few studies had
been done so far to support such broad claims, and that
it could turn out that other, more mundane workaday
genes, of the sort that were being studied long before
evo-devo appeared on the scene, would play equally or
even more important roles.
<p>“I urge caution,” Dr. Coyne said. “We just don’t know.”
<p>All of which goes to show that like all emerging
fields, evo-devo’s significance and the uniqueness of
its contributions will continue to be reassessed. It
will remain to be seen just how separate or incorporated
into the rest of evolutionary thinking its findings will
end up being. Paradoxically, it was during just such a
flurry of intellectual synthesis and research activity,
the watershed known as the New or Modern Synthesis in
which modern evolutionary biology was born in the last
century, that developmental thinking was almost entirely
ejected from the science of evolution.
<p>But perhaps today synthesizers can do better,
broadening their focus without constricting their view
of evolution as they try to take in all of the great
pageant that is the history of life.
<p>“We’re still a very young field,” Dr. Gilbert said.
“But I think this is a new evolutionary synthesis, an
emerging evolutionary synthesis. I think we’re seeing it.”<p>
