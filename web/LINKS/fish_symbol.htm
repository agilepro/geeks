For many pop-culture Christians, the "fish"
decal on the back car bumper, or attached to a
key chain or door is a symbol of their religion,
and a feel-good statement about Jesus Christ.
Early Christians used the fish as a recognition
sign of their religion. It is also identified as
the "Ichthus," an acronym from the Greek, "Iesous
Christos Theou Uios Soter," or "Jesus Christ the
Son of God, Saviour." Oxford English Dictionary
(C.E.) defines "Ichthyic" as "of, pertaining to,
or characteristic of fishes; the fish world in
all its orders."

<p>But contemporary Jesus worshippers might be
surprised, even outraged, to learn that one of
their preeminent religious symbols antedated the
Christian religion, and has its roots in pagan
fertility awareness and sexuality. Barbara G.
Walker writes in "The Woman&#39;s Dictionary of
Symbols and Sacred Objects," that the acronym
pertaining to Jesus Christ was a "rationale
invented after the fact... Christians simply
copied this pagan symbol along with many
others." Ichthys was the offspring son of the
ancient Sea goddess Atargatis, and was known in
various mythic systems as Tirgata, Aphrodite,
Pelagia or Delphine. The word also meant "womb"
and "dolphin" in some tongues, and
representations of this appeared in the
depiction of mermaids. The fish also a central
element in other stories, including the Goddess
of Ephesus (who has a fish amulet covering her
genital region), as well as the tale of the fish
that swallowed the penis of Osiris, and was also
considered a symbol of the vulva of Isis.

<p>Along with being a generative and reproductive
spirit in mythology, the fish also has been
identified in certain cultures with
reincarnation and the life force. Sir James
George Frazer noted in his work, "Adonis, Attis,
Osiris: Studies in the History of Oriental
Religion" (Part Four of his larger work, "The
Golden Bough") that among one group in India,
the fish was believed to house a deceased soul,
and that as part of a fertility ritual specific
fish is eaten in the belief that it will be
reincarnated in a newborn child.

<p>Well before Christianity, the fish symbol was
known as "the Great Mother," a pointed oval
sign, the "vesica piscis" or Vessel of the Fish.
"Fish" and "womb" were synonymous terms in
ancient Greek,"delphos." Its link to fertility,
birth, feminine sexuality and the natural force
of women was acknowledged also by the Celts, as
well as pagan cultures throughout northern
Europe. Eleanor Gaddon traces a "Cult of the
Fish Mother" as far back as the hunting and
fishing people of the Danube River Basin in the
sixth millennium B.C.E. Over fifty shrines have
been found throughout the region which depict a
fishlike deity, a female creature who
"incorporates aspects of an egg, a fish and a
woman which could have been a primeval creator
or a mythical ancestress..." The "Great Goddess"
was portrayed elsewhere with pendulous breasts,
accentuated buttocks and a conspicuous vaginal
orifice, the upright "vesica piscis" which
Christians later adopted and rotated 90-degrees
to serve as their symbol.

<p>Along with the fish used as a code sign for
early Christian communities, the ichthys also
found its way into the ritual and decor of
church rites. One case in point is the church
mitre worn by prelates. Where did this
originate? Dr. Thomas Inman discussed this
phenomenon in his two volume opus, "Ancient
Faiths Embodied in Ancient Names," (1869). He
included a representation of a sculpture from
Mesopotamia, observing "It is the impression of
an ancient gem, and represents a man clothed
with a fish, the head being the mitre; priests
thus clothed, often bearing in their hand the
mystic bag..."

<p>"In almost every instance," added Inman, "it
will be recognized that the fish&#39;s head is
represented as of the same form as the modern
bishop&#39;s mitre." The fish also appears in
another sacred iconograph, the Avatars of
Vishnu, where the deity "is represented as
emerging from the mouth of a fish, and being a
fish himself; the legend being that he was to be
the Saviour of the world in a deluge which was
to follow..."

<p>From its focus of worshipping a god-man born of
a virgin to the selection of holidays and
symbols, Christianity appropriated the metaphors
of earlier pagan religions, grafting them into
its own account of the creation and beyond. Few
Jesus worshippers are aware of this. Even fewer
know that when they flaunt the "Ichthus" or
Ichthys on a tee-shirt, car bumper or even the
door of a state legislative office as a
representation which originated in Christianity,
they are in fact, displaying a more ancient
symbol indicative of female anatomy and
reproductive potency -- the very sign of the
Great Mother.<p><hr><h3 align=center>
