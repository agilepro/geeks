CHICAGO — Observed in the wild and tested in captivity,
chimpanzees invite comparison with humans, their close
relatives. They bear a family resemblance that
fascinates people, and scientists see increasing
evidence of similarities in chimp behavior and skills,
making some of them think on the vagaries of evolution.<p>

<p>For some time, paleontologists and evolutionary
biologists have known that chimp ancestors were the last
line of today’s apes to diverge from the branch that led
to humans, probably six million, maybe four million
years ago. More recent examination shows that despite
profound differences in the two species, just a 1.23
percent difference in their genes separates Homo sapiens
from chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes.
<p>And certain similarities between the two species,
scientists say, go beyond expressive faces and opposable
thumbs.
<p>Chimps display a remarkable range of behavior and
talent. They make and use simple tools, hunt in groups
and engage in aggressive, violent acts. They are social
creatures that appear to be capable of empathy,
altruism, self-awareness, cooperation in problem solving
and learning through example and experience. Chimps even
outperform humans in some memory tasks.
<p>“Fifty years ago, we knew next to nothing about
chimpanzees,” said Andrew Whiten, an evolutionary
psychologist at the University of St. Andrews in
Scotland. “You could not have predicted the richness and
complexity of chimp culture that we know now.”
<p>Jane Goodall, a young English woman working in Africa
in the 1960s, began changing perceptions. At first,
experts disputed her reports of chimps’ using tools and
social behavior. The experts especially objected to her
references to chimp culture. Just humans, they insisted,
had “culture.”
<p>“Jane suffered early rejection by the establishment,”
Richard Wrangham, aHarvard anthropologist, said. “Now, the people who
say chimpanzees don’t have emotions and culture are the
ones rejected.”
<p>The new consensus framed discussions in March at a
symposium, “The Mind of the Chimpanzee,” at the Lincoln
Park Zoo here. More than 300 primatologists and other
scientists reviewed accumulating knowledge of chimps’
cognitive abilities.
<p>After one session, Frans de Waal of
Emory University said that as recently as a decade
ago there was still no firm consensus on many of the
social relationships of chimps. “You don’t hear any
debate now,” he said.
<p>In his own studies at the Yerkes Primate Research
Center at Emory, Dr. de Waal found that chimps as social
animals have had to constrain and alter their behavior
in various ways, as have humans. It is a part of ape
inheritance, he said, and in the case of humans, the
basis for morality. The provocative interpretation was
advanced in his recent book, “Primates and
Philosophers.”
<p>Other reports shortly before the symposium had
elaborated on the abilities of chimps as toolmakers.
Jill Pruetz, a primatologist at
Iowa State University, described 22 examples of
chimps in Senegal making stick spears to hunt smaller
primates for their meat. Dr. Goodall was the first to
call attention to chimps as hunting carnivores, not
strictly vegetarians.
<p>Dr. Pruetz observed several chimps jabbing the spears
into hollow tree trunks where bush babies often dwell.
Just one attempt was successful. Previously, chimps had
been seen using sticks mainly to extract termites from
their nests.
<p>A team of archaeologists led by Julio Mercader of the
University of Calgary reported finding stones in Ivory
Coast that chimps used 4,300 years ago to crack nuts.
Today’s chimps have often been videotaped using rocks as
a hammer to open nuts. The old stones with starch
residues from nuts, the researchers said, were the
earliest strong evidence of chimp tool use, and the
finding suggested that chimps had learned the skill on
their own, rather than copying humans.
<p>Other researchers combine field work showing chimp
behavior in natural habitats with laboratory experiments
that are created to disclose their underlying
intelligence — what scientists call their “cognitive reserve.”
<p>For example, chimps on their own would not sit at a
computer responding with rapid touches on the screen as
a test of their immediate memory. Videos of their doing
just that at Kyoto University in Japan especially
impressed the symposium scientists.
<p>Tetsuro Matsuzawa, a Kyoto primatologist, described a
young chimp watching as numbers 1 through 9 flashed on
the computer screen at random positions. Then the
numbers disappeared in no more than a second. White
squares remained where the numbers had been. The chimp
casually but swiftly pressed the squares, calling back
the numbers in ascending order — 1, 2, 3, etc.
<p>The test was repeated several times, with the numbers
and squares in different places. The chimp, which had
months of training accompanied by promised food rewards,
almost never failed to remember where the numbers had
been. The video included scenes of a human failing the
test, seldom recalling more than one or two numbers, if any.
<p>“Humans can’t do it,” Dr. Matsuzawa said.
“Chimpanzees are superior to humans in this task.”
<p>Dr. Matsuzawa suggested that early human species
“lost the immediate memory and, in return, learned
symbolization, the language skills.”
<p>“I call this the trade-off theory,” he continued. “If
you want a capability like better immediate memory, you
have to lose some other capability.”
<p>Other experiments at Kyoto’s primate center
demonstrated the ability of chimps to recognize
themselves and focus attention on others. Masaki
Tomonaga, who conducted the tests, said that an infant
made eye contact with its mother at about 2 months and
that sometime after the first year was able to maintain
a gaze as the mother moved about.
<p>Dr. Tomonaga said such “gaze following” developed in
humans about the same age, “though infant humans
generally have more complex interactions.”
<p>Misato Hayashi, also from Kyoto, described
experiments with infant chimps’ manipulating nesting
cups and square and cylindrical blocks. They were slower
to learn than humans, but the manual dexterity was
there. A human starts stacking blocks shortly after age
1, he said; chimps are almost 3 before getting the hang of it.
<p>In experiments with mirrors, researchers showed that
chimps had an awareness of themselves that is absent in
monkeys but present in dolphins and all the great apes.
Similar tests by Emory scientists showed some
self-recognition among elephants.
<p>These behaviors were reported by Dr. de Waal and his
associate J. M. Plotnik, who said that they “may suggest
convergent cognitive evolution probably related to
complex sociality and cooperation well documented in
both chimpanzees and elephants.”
<p>Other researchers said that when confronted with
problems obtaining food from the other side of a fence,
chimps were not only clever on their own and often
competitive with a fellow chimp, but they also showed a
willingness to cooperate with one another to get the job done.
<p>Brian Hare of Duke University and the Max Planck Institute for
Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, said
bonobos outperformed their chimp relatives in
cooperative tasks and shared food more readily.
<p>The emotions of caring and mourning have been
observed, as in the case of the chimp mother that
carried on her back the corpse of her 2-year-old
daughter for days after she had died. After fights
between two chimps, scientists said, others in the group
were seen consoling the loser and acting as mediators to
restore peace.
<p>Devyn Carter of Emory described the sympathetic
response to a chimp named Knuckles, who was afflicted
with cerebral palsy. No fellow chimp was seen to take
advantage of his disability. Even the alpha male gently
groomed Knuckles.
<p>Dr. Wrangham of Harvard said the challenge to
primatologists working in the field was to learn how
much of the behavior and “surplus cognitive capacity”
observed in captivity applied in the wild.
<p>The answer seems to vary from one isolated chimp
community to another. Scientists said that indicated the
role of social learning — picking up skills by emulation
— and responses to different opportunities in separate
cultures.
<p>At Gombe, the site in Tanzania where Dr. Goodall made
a name for herself, the chimps with stick tools are
accomplished extractors of termites from their nests.
But termite fishing is rare in Bossou, Guinea. At
Bossou, and not Gombe, chimps have learned to make use
of many other tools, including stones for cracking nuts.
<p>Dora Biro of the University of Oxford in England has
studied tool use by chimps at the Bossou site. They fold
leaves in a mat to sponge water out of tree hollows and
scoop algae off stream surfaces. They collect edible
ants with sticks. They take stouter tree branches and
pound the juicy palm fiber to a pulp, preparing another
favorite food.
<p>Videos of Bossou nutcrackers show adult chimps, often
female, placing a nut on a flat stone anvil and slamming
down on it with a smaller rock. Two or three youngsters
sit around watching. The adults do not appear to be
giving instructions, except by example.
<p>“What we’ve learned is that manipulation of objects
begins around 1 year of age,” Dr. Biro said. “If it
involves two or three objects, as in cracking nuts, that
happens at 3 ½ to 5 years. If it is not learned by 6 or
7, it will never be acquired.”
<p>At a dense forest in the Congo Republic, Crickette M.
Sanz of the Max Planck institute said the chimps seemed
as curious about her as she was about them. Groups came
forward, calling others to join them. Sometimes, they
sat with her for hours, eating fruit, grooming and even
mating.
<p>For a more detached study, Dr. Sanz deployed 18 video
cameras at remote locations and recorded 84 hours of
chimp tool use. Leaf sponging was the simplest, she
concluded, and collecting honey with a long stick
required the most effort and risk, with termite fishing
having “the highest element of success.”
<p>Dr. Sanz, who has worked with her husband, David B.
Morgan, on some of the research, described mother
chimps’ carefully withdrawing from a hole sticks
swarming with black termites while their infants looked
on. These social interactions, she said, passed on
essential techniques and behaviors to the next
generation.
<p>“Socially transmitted adjustable behavior,” Dr. de
Waal said, is a hallmark of culture.
<p>Chimp behavior sometimes turns violent, particularly
in territorial clashes. In Uganda, John Mitani of the
University of Michigan observed chimp patrols
regularly policing the forest boundaries of their
communities. One patrol was seen assaulting an adult
male, killing and emasculating him.
<p>Kristin Bonnie, another Emory primatologist, said the
transmission of behavior could be benign and
spontaneous, with the prospect of reward being
secondary. “It is the desire to act like others, an
identification with certain others,” she explained,
citing as an example the way chimps usually clasp hands
while grooming each other.
<p>At the symposium, researchers said the interest in
learning more about chimps was not just a case of
knowledge for the sake of knowledge. Their behavior and
intelligence, scientists say, may offer insights into
the abilities of early human ancestors like
Australopithecus afarensis, the apelike “Lucy” species
that thrived more than three million years ago. A more
urgent motivation for the research, primatologists say,
is that these are sentient beings and the closest living
relatives of humans, and their survival is threatened.
<p>Elizabeth V. Lonsdorf, a primatologist at the Lincoln
Park Zoo and a symposium organizer, said researchers
needed “to keep their eyes out for ways to improve the
care of chimpanzees.”
<p>Diseases like ebola and anthrax are taking their
toll. Hunting chimps for “bush meat” is increasing. Many
of the forest habitats of chimps in central Africa are
being cut by loggers and land developers. As a result,
Dr. Lonsdorf said, “Groups of the animals are getting
closer together, which increased the threat of chimp
violence and territorial disputes.”
<p>Dr. Goodall recalled that when she went to Africa
nearly a half-century ago, at least a million chimps
lived in the continent, and “now there are perhaps only
150,000.” In that time, they have impressed scientists
with physical and emotional reminders of their kinship
to humans and their occasional triumphs over them at a
computer screen.
