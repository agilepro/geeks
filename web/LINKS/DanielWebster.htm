Get Facts Straight Before Calling a Nation Christian</span></u></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Courier New; color: black"><br><br>by Reverend Daniel J. Webster</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Courier New; color: black"><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Stop it. Just quit. All these letters and commentaries<br>about "under God" and the Pledge of Allegiance and the founding 
<br>fathers being Christian and this being a Christian nation have just 
<br>got to stop. Even a Utah sculptor revises history depicting three 
<br>founding fathers kneeling at prayer, a scene historians call<br>unthinkable.<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If you are going to argue something, get the facts right. If you
<br>want to claim that this should be a Christian nation or that you 
<br>believe God should be included in the pledge, the Star-Spangled 
<br>Banner, prayed to in all schools, then be up front and say that's 
<br>what you are trying to do. Don't invoke the memory of those who 
<br>worked so hard to keep religion and government separate. Don't claim
<br>that because the founders were "Christian" that gives Christians 
<br>today some sort of preferential status in the country.<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; When this controversy broke out about the pledge I went back to 
<br>my seminary textbook. Edwin Scott Gaustad in A Religious History of 
<br>America (HarperCollins, 1990) tells a fascinating account of Thomas 
<br>Jefferson, James Madison and Patrick Henry. In 1777, then Virginia 
<br>Gov. Jefferson proposed a "Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom."
<br>It would ensure that no one religion would have government approval 
<br>in the Commonwealth. Henry countered with his own "Bill Establishing
<br>a Provision for Teachers of the Christian Religion" which would have
<br>acknowledged no one denomination but would recognize Christianity as
<br>the official state-sanctioned religion.<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; With Jefferson's move to France as ambassador for the new nation,
<br>the cause was picked up by Madison. He argued that no religion should
<br>have any established position. Henry made his case before the<br>delegates. As word of this effort spread, Baptists and Presbyterians
<br>opposed it. Some thought it a ruse that would eventually favor the
<span style>&nbsp; &nbsp;  </span><br>Anglicans who were a majority of the signers of the Declaration of 
<br>Independence.<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Madison said that not only should there be freedom of religion in
<br>the commonwealth, there should also be freedom from religion.<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 1786, Madison won. It set the stage a year later for the 
<br>crafting of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. No religion 
<br>would have a favored status as far as the government of this new 
<br>nation would be concerned.<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; As for calling this a Christian nation, that puzzles me. I<br>suspect it would also puzzle George Barna. He has been researching 
<br>religious social trends for more than a decade. Interviewed in<br>Christianity Today (Aug. 5), he laments that most "churchgoers didn't
<br>seem to have any real understanding of the Bible's distinctive<br>message; many practicing Christians believed that God helps those who
<br>help themselves." The conclusion he reaches, he told interviewer Tim
<br>Stafford, is that "a morally relativistic American culture was<br>shaping Christians more than Christians were shaping the culture." 
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If this country were a Christian nation, its citizens and
<br>government would be working tirelessly to make sure no one went to 
<br>bed hungry tonight and that everyone would have a home. Universal 
<br>health care would be a reality and not just a political debate. 
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If you are curious about scriptural foundations for these points,
<br>start with the Gospel of Matthew, Chapter 25. Then go to Matthew 22 
<br>where the lawyer tried to trick Jesus asking him which was the most 
<br>important commandment. "Love God with all your heart, all your soul 
<br>and all your mind, and love your neighbor as yourself," he retorted.
<br>Jesus' response to that question is clearly Jewish. He quotes the 
<br>Torah (Deuteronomy 6:5 and Leviticus 19:18). He didn't make up<br>anything new.
What is often called the "Greatest Commandment" is not
<br>uniquely Christian.<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; What has been called the "Golden Rule" attributed to Jesus (Luke
<br>6:31) can be found in some form in most major world religions. It is
<br>not found in much of what this country has been doing in domestic and
<br>foreign policy for too many years.<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Call it a democratic nation. Call it a republic, if you like. 
<br>Call it the land of the free.<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Please don't call it a Christian nation.<br>
