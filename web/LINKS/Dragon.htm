"A fire-breathing dragon lives in my garage"<p>
Suppose (I'm following a group therapy approach by the psychologist
Richard Franklin) I seriously make such an assertion to you.&nbsp; Surely
you'd want to check it out, see for yourself.&nbsp; There have been
innumerable stories of dragons over the centuries, but no real evidence.
What an opportunity!<p>
"Show me," you say.&nbsp; I lead you to my garage.&nbsp; You look inside and see a
ladder, empty paint cans, an old tricycle -- but no dragon.<p>
"Where's the dragon?" you ask.<p>
"Oh, she's right here," I reply, waving vaguely.&nbsp; "I neglected to mention
that she's an invisible dragon."<p>
You propose spreading flour on the floor of the garage to capture the
dragon's footprints.<p>
"Good idea," I say, "but this dragon floats in the air."<p>
Then you'll use an infrared sensor to detect the invisible fire.<p>
"Good idea, but the invisible fire is also heatless."<p>
You'll spray-paint the dragon and make her visible.<p>
"Good idea, but she's an incorporeal dragon and the paint won't stick."&nbsp; And
so on.&nbsp; I counter every physical test you propose with a special
explanation of why it won't work.<p>
Now, what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating
dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all?&nbsp; If there's no way
to disprove my contention, no conceivable experiment that would count
against it, what does it mean to say that my dragon exists?&nbsp; Your
inability to invalidate my hypothesis is not at all the same thing as
proving it true.&nbsp; Claims that cannot be tested, assertions immune to
disproof are veridically  worthless, whatever value they may have in
inspiring us or in exciting our sense of wonder.&nbsp; What I'm asking you to
do comes down to believing, in the absence of evidence, on my say-so.&nbsp; The
only thing you've really learned from my insistence that there's a
dragon in my garage is that something funny is going on inside my head.&nbsp; You'd
wonder, if no physical tests apply, what convinced me.&nbsp; The
possibility that it was a dream or a hallucination would certainly enter
your mind.&nbsp; But then, why am I taking it so seriously?&nbsp; Maybe I need help.&nbsp; At
the least, maybe I've seriously underestimated human fallibility.&nbsp; Imagine
that, despite none of the tests being successful, you wish to be
scrupulously open-minded.&nbsp; So you don't outright reject the notion that
there's a fire-breathing dragon in my garage.&nbsp; You merely put it on hold.&nbsp; Present
evidence is strongly against it, but if a new body of data
emerge you're prepared to examine it and see if it convinces you.&nbsp; Surely
it's unfair of me to be offended at not being believed; or to criticize
you for being stodgy and unimaginative -- merely because you rendered the
Scottish verdict of "not proved."<p>
Imagine that things had gone otherwise.&nbsp; The dragon is invisible, all
right, but footprints are being made in the flour as you watch.&nbsp; Your
infrared detector reads off-scale.&nbsp; The spray paint reveals a jagged
crest bobbing in the air before you.&nbsp; No matter how skeptical you might
have been about the existence of dragons -- to say nothing about invisible
ones -- you must now acknowledge that there's something here, and that in
a preliminary way it's consistent with an invisible, fire-breathing dragon.<p>
Now another scenario: Suppose it's not just me.&nbsp; Suppose that several
people of your acquaintance, including people who you're pretty sure
don't know each other, all tell you that they have dragons in their
garages -- but in every case the evidence is maddeningly elusive.&nbsp; All of
us admit we're disturbed at being gripped by so odd a conviction so
ill-supported by the physical evidence.&nbsp; None of us is a lunatic.&nbsp; We
speculate about what it would mean if invisible dragons were really
hiding out in garages all over the world, with us humans just catching
on.&nbsp; I'd rather it not be true, I tell you.&nbsp; But maybe all those ancient
European and Chinese myths about dragons weren't myths at all.<p>
Gratifyingly, some dragon-size footprints in the flour are now reported.&nbsp; But
they're never made when a skeptic is looking.&nbsp; An alternative
explanation presents itself.&nbsp; On close examination it seems clear that
the footprints could have been faked.&nbsp; Another dragon enthusiast shows up
with a burnt finger and attributes it to a rare physical manifestation
of the dragon's fiery breath.&nbsp; But again, other possibilities exist.&nbsp; We
understand that there are other ways to burn fingers besides the breath
of invisible dragons.&nbsp; Such "evidence" -- no matter how important the
dragon advocates consider it -- is far from compelling.&nbsp; Once again, the
only sensible approach is tentatively to reject the dragon hypothesis,
to be open to future physical data, and to wonder what the cause might
be that so many apparently sane and sober people share the same strange delusion.<p>
