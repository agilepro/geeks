<p>Dear Mr. Thomas:<br>
<br>
   Thank you for writing to express your reservations about a Senate<br>
resolution affirming the importance of a national day of prayer.<br>
<br>
   Let me begin by saying that I understand your concern regarding the<br>
separation of church and state.  However, Congressional resolutions regarding<br>
a day of prayer are a tradition that predate the founding of the United States<br>
the Continental Congress first issued a proclamation setting aside a day of<br>
prayer in 1775.<br>
<br>
   It is also important to note that the passage of this resolution is<br>
non-binding and has no legal ramifications.  It merely expresses the sense of<br>
the Senate.<br>
<br>
   Please know that I value your opinion and hope you will continue to<br>
keep me informed of your views  and concerns.  If you should have any additional<br>
questions or comments, please do not hesitate to call my Washington, DC staff at<br>
(202) 224-3841.<br>
<br>
   Best Regards.<br>
<br><br><br><br>
             Sincerely yours,<br>
<br>
             Dianne Feinstein<br>
             United States Senator</p>
