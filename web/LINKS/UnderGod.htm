 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We're all born as Atheists.&nbsp; Many of us stay
 Atheists.&nbsp; Some choose Atheism after trying something else.<o:p>
 </o:p>
 </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 1 in 7 Americans are religion-free, according
 to the latest and most complete survey.&nbsp; If Atheism were a religion, we'd
 be one of the largest.<o:p>
 </o:p>
 </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 6 in 7 Americans choose religion, whether brand
 C, H, I, J or any other major or off-brand.<o:p>
 </o:p>
 </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's American freedom of religion.&nbsp; Our
 Constitution says our government won't get involved in religion.&nbsp; It says
 government will govern, not preach.&nbsp; If we had obeyed our Constitution in
 1954, we wouldn't be arguing about the Pledge of Allegiance today.<o:p>
 </o:p>
 </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all the distracting smoke, we should remember that
 the Pledge isn't a legal document.&nbsp; It is a custom.&nbsp; It is powerful
 poetry, written by a private citizen to express his dedication and pride.&nbsp;
 Interestingly, the author didn't think religion belonged in it.&nbsp; Federal
 bureaucrats have altered it twice, reducing its poetic and universal value,
 but it has become an American tradition.&nbsp; Surprisingly, it is both
 embraced and shunned for fervent religious reasons.<o:p>
 </o:p>
 </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; America lived without a Pledge for half its life,
 surviving a civil war that nearly killed our country.&nbsp; During the first
 half of the Pledge's life, before "under god" was added, America
 survived 2 World Wars and a crushing Depression.&nbsp; Obviously, America does
 fine without being "under" anything, whether kings or gods, real or
 imaginary.<o:p>
 </o:p>
 </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thomas Jefferson and the other American founders
 wanted a fresh start.&nbsp; They knew from their experiences in Europe and
 their own colonies how church and state could corrupt each other.&nbsp; They
 said "NO" to religion in the very first item of the Bill of Rights.<o:p>
 </o:p>
 </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saying "NO" to religion was also done for a
 very practical reason.&nbsp; The founders wanted to get the new Constitution
 adopted quickly so they could prepare for war, and they knew that religious
 arguments never end.&nbsp; If Maryland had pushed for national Catholicism,
 Pennsylvania held firm for Lutheranism, and Rhode Island insisted on
 Quakerism, Great Britain would have us tithing to the Church of England.<o:p>
 </o:p>
 </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saying "NO" to religion has important
 practical benefits today, too. It encourages science.&nbsp;&nbsp; It attracts
 worldwide immigrant talent and energy.&nbsp; And it increases our
 international influence.<o:p>
 </o:p>
 </span></p>
 <p class="MsoBodyText"><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our religion-free government is respected worldwide.&nbsp;
 Our religious neutrality gives America the capacity to act for human rights in
 the world, regardless of religions involved.&nbsp; We are strong when we are
 neutral, and weak when we choose sides in deadly fights over religion.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 A good referee doesn't choose sides.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, our ill-informed president has chosen
 to take sides in the world's oldest religious war, weakening both our national
 strength and worldwide respect.<o:p>
 </o:p>
 </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If our government had stayed out of religion, Muslim
 maniacs might not have "praised Allah" by leveling the World Trade
 Center.&nbsp; If our government had stayed out of religion, Jews might not
 have leveled Muslim Palestinian refugee camps.&nbsp; If our government had
 stayed out of religion, China might not have religiously persecuted its
 citizens.&nbsp; Even Hitler acted for strong religious reasons.&nbsp; Have we
 forgotten the horrors of the Inquisition, inflicted by governments controlled
 by religion?&nbsp; We must do better.<o:p>
 </o:p>
 </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this world of nuclear dangers, we need to minimize
 religion's inherent divisiveness.<o:p>
 </o:p>
 </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; America must return to our "religiously
 neutral" position to regain respect at home and abroad.&nbsp; It is the
 law.&nbsp; It is our most important law.&nbsp; Anything less is illegal, as
 the court said.<o:p>
 </o:p>
 </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It takes courage to stand for the law, when the
 public is filled with mindless religious fervor.&nbsp; But calm in the face of
 fervor is exactly why we have courts.&nbsp; We should applaud their sensible
 handling of this old mistake.<o:p>
 </o:p>
 </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atheists are patriots, too.&nbsp; Our dedication to
 American values is undiluted by religion.&nbsp; I'm a full-fledged American
 voter and veteran.&nbsp; I want to pledge allegiance to my country, not to
 someone else's religion.<o:p>
 </o:p>
 </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; America's pledge should include all Americans.&nbsp;
 All Americans, especially our younger people, fervently want us to fix this.&nbsp;
 Let's make it legal again.&nbsp; Let's use this opportunity to quickly return
 the Pledge of Allegiance to its original full-strength version, so all
 Americans can pledge proudly.&nbsp; Let's be One Nation Indivisible, not
 divided factions fighting over illegal foolishness.<o:p>
