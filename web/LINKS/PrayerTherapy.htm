<h3>Follow-Up Study on Prayer Therapy May Help Refute False and Misleading Information About Earlier Clinical Trial</h3>
<p>by Nathan Bupp<br>
Director of Public Affairs<br>
Commission for Scientific Medicine and Mental Health
<p>A study on the healing
power of remote prayer in the current issue of the medical journal <i>Lancet</i>
may help correct misleading statements that the lead author made about the
preceding pilot study. Thanks in part to this misinformation, the earlier
study continues to be widely cited as scientific evidence of the efficacy of prayer.
<p>Dr. Mitchell Krucoff, a cardiologist at Duke University Medical Center, in
Durham, NC, is the lead author of the <i>Lancet</i> study as well the pilot
study that was published in the November 2001 issue of the <i>American Heart
Journal</i>. Much misinformation about the apparent efficacy of prayer
therapy has come from the author’s misleading statements to the news media,
says Andrew Skolnick, executive director of the Commission for Scientific
Medicine and Mental Health.
<p>“If you compare what Dr. Krucoff told the news media with the actual
results of the pilot study, you should be quite surprised,” Skolnick says.
<p>Both the pilot and <i>Lancet</i> studies investigated the effects of
“noetic” therapies on heart patients undergoing treatment to unclog their
coronary arteries. Noetic therapies are treatments that don’t involve drugs,
surgery, or other tangible intervention. The therapy receiving the most
attention were prayers delivered remotely by people unknown to the patients.
<p>The current study in the July 16 issue of <i>Lancet</i> reports the
findings of the MANTRA II trial (MANTRA stands for Monitoring and
Actualization of Noetic TRAinings), which was launched to confirm the findings
of the much smaller MANTRA I trial.
<p>In news interviews following its publication, Dr. Krucoff claimed he and
his co-authors saw “impressive reductions in all negative outcomes” —
including congestive heart failure and death — among patients who received
remote prayer treatment, compared with those who were not treated with prayer.
<p>“If one takes the trouble to read the MANTRA I study,” says Skolnick,
“ one can see that the prayed-for group of patients had one more death than
the patients in the group who received only standard care. Contrary to what
Dr. Krucoff told the news media, there was no difference, impressive or
otherwise, in the number of patients who suffered congestive heart failure.”
<p>In the pilot study, 30 patients undergoing conventional therapy to unblock
their coronary arteries unknowingly received prayers from people they did not
know. A variety of clinical results from these patients were then compared
with those of 30 patients who received conventional care, but no prayer
therapy. While no patient in the conventional care group died, one patient in
the prayed-for group died during the six-month study period. In addition, no
patient in either group suffered congestive heart failure.
<p>Nevertheless, in an <a href="http://exn.ca/video/?video=exn20011120-heart.asx">interview
for the Discovery Channel</a>, Dr. Krucoff states:
<blockquote>
<p>We saw impressive reductions in all of the negative outcomes — the bad
outcomes that were measured in the study. What we look for routinely in
cardiology trials are outcomes such as death, a heart attack, or the lungs
filling with water — what we call congestive heart failure — in patients
who are treated in the course of these problems. In the group randomly
assigned to prayer therapy, there was a 50 percent reduction in all
complications and a 100 percent reduction in major complications.
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, in an article in the August 2000 issue of Massachusetts Medical
Society’s publication <i>Hippocrates</i>, Dr. Krucoff claims,
<blockquote>
<p>Adverse outcomes in the prayer group were 50 percent to 100 percent fewer
than in the standard therapy group. In the patients who received any of the
noetic therapies, including prayer, we found a 30 percent reduction for
every adverse outcome we measured.
</blockquote>
<p>In a recorded interview with Skolnick in July 2004, Dr. Krucoff claimed
there was “no difference” between the number of deaths among the
prayed-for patients and the patients who received only conventional care. When
Skolnick pointed out that the authors’ published data show one patient died
in the prayer group while none died in the control group, Dr. Krucoff
answered, “Well the difference between zero and one in a cohort of 30 people
is no difference.”
<p>“That answer defies logic,” Skolnick says. “One death clearly is
different from no deaths. Even more inexplicable was his claim that one death
is a ‘reduction’ from zero deaths.”
<p>The <i>Lancet</i> study included many more patients than the MANTRA I
study and involved eight medical centers in addition to the Duke University
Medical Center. It concludes that prayer therapy had no detectable effect on
the health outcomes measured in the study. While Skolnick says he hopes these
results will finally correct the misinformation about the earlier study that
continues to circulate, he fears they may be spun to support the claim that
intercessory prayer is effective medical therapy.
<p>“Five years ago,” Skolnick says, “Dr. Krucoff told <i>Hippocrates</i>
that he and his colleagues were designing ‘a definitive trial to confirm the
finding’ of the MANTRA I study. The results of that trial has now been
published, but it is no longer being called definitive.”
<p>In a July 14 Duke University press release, Dr. Krucoff says,
<blockquote>
<p>While it’s clear there was no measurable impact on the primary
composite endpoints of this study, the trends and behavior of pre-specified
secondary outcome measures suggest treatment effects that can be taken
pretty seriously when considering future study directions.
</blockquote>
<p>An accompanying editorial in <i>Lancet</i> appears to echo this spin:
<blockquote>
<p>Could a more restricted denominational approach have influenced the
outcome? Does the number of those praying matter? Or the timing and duration
of prayer? Would it have been more fruitful to have used a battery of
subtler qualitative endpoints?
</blockquote>
<p>Those questions, the editorial says, “provide a basis for further inquiry.”
<p>“So obviously it was not a definitive study,” Skolnick says.
<blockquote>
<p>It seems that for some, the medical benefits of remote prayer may be a
non-falsifiable hypothesis that can always be rescued with new hypothesis to
explain away the lack of confirmatory results. As such, it’s a subject
more appropriate for pseudoscience than science.
