by Dr. N. Joseph Newton<p><br>

Just suppose you were a psychotherapist and you had never heard or read anything about the dogma of Christianity.<p>

Just suppose you had a client who is explaining his internal world to you.<p>

Just suppose he had told you he often has conversations with a man who died over 2000 years ago.<p>

Just suppose you question your client as to what this person looked like and he answers he does not know.&nbsp; When you question his not knowing, he answers "The man I speak to is invisible."<p>

Just suppose you ask him for more details about this invisible man and he answers that the invisible man was his own father and son and the Holy Ghost all at the same time.<p>

Just suppose you press for more information and you are told that this invisible person is really three people but remains one.<p>

Just suppose your client tells you that this invisible man's mother never had sexual relations yet gave birth to this man.<p>

Just suppose your client tells you when asked where this invisible man lives that he tells you he lives up there in the stratosphere.<p>

Just suppose your client tells you that once a week he partakes in the ritual of eating this man's flesh and drinking his blood in a mass ceremony with many other people.<p>

Just suppose your client tells you that he will never die because he is going to a place where people will live forever.<p>

Just suppose your client tells you that even though his body will be consumed his soul, that is also invisible, will live forever.<p>

Just suppose your client tells you that he will meet all of his deceased friends and relatives in this place high above the clouds.<p>

Just suppose the client tells you that twice a week he visits a man, who is unseen, in a little cubicle to listen to the crimes he has committed during the week.&nbsp; If the crimes are severe he is told to say a "Hail Mary" prayer ten times depending upon the gravity of the crime and they will be excused.<p>

Just suppose your client tells you that there are certain laws he must follow or he will be punished in a sea of fire for eternity.<p>

Just suppose your client tells you that there is a certain man called the Devil who watches over him in that sea of fire to be sure he suffers.<p>

Just suppose your client tells you that it is okay to suffer pain during your lifetime because he will be rewarded for his suffering after he dies.<p>

Just suppose you have to diagnose your client for a Mental Status Exam, what would be your diagnoses?
