<h1>Study: DNA of Humans, Chimps Nearly Identical</h1>
<h3>96% of the 3 billion genetic letters in the 2 blueprints are the same, researchers find.</h3>
USA Today, September 1, 2005<br>By Steve Sternberg
<p>Humans and chimpanzees share an almost identical
genetic inheritance, scientists report today in a landmark comparison
they call an "elegant confirmation" of the theory of evolution.
<p>The research is the first comprehensive analysis of
the human and chimp genomes. The 3 billion genetic letters in the two
genetic blueprints are 96 percent identical with just 40 million
differences, the researchers report in the journal Nature.
<p>By delving more deeply into those differences,
researchers hope to discover new explanations of why humans are
susceptible to certain diseases, why evolutionary paths might have
diverged from ancestral chimps 6 million years ago, and what makes us
human.
<p>"We can peek into evolution's lab notebook and
see what went on there," says Francis Collins, director of the
National Human Genome Research Institute. Project costs ranged from
$20 million to $30 million, he said.
<p>The analysis offers clues to the cause of diseases
such as Alzheimer's and to why humans might be more susceptible to
some infections. "Evolutionary analysis is a handmaiden to human
medicine," says Eric Lander, of the Broad Institute of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard.
<p>In a discovery that might offer an insight into
Alzheimer's disease, researchers found mutations that inactivate the
human version of the gene "caspase-12," which limits cells'
life span. Those mutations weren't found in chimps, which aren't as
susceptible to Alzheimer's. Knocking out "caspase-12" in
mice causes Alzheimer's-like deposits to form in their brains.
<p>Researchers also identified mutations in the human
genome that were so beneficial for survival they quickly became
"the norm throughout humanity." And they found that the
Y-chromosome, which confers maleness, has remained more stable in
humans than in chimps.
<p>"Reading these two genomes side by side, it's
amazing to see the evolutionary changes that are occurring," said
Robert Waterston of the University of Washington. "I couldn't
imagine (naturalist Charles) Darwin looking for stronger confirmation
of his theories."<p><hr><h3 align=center>
