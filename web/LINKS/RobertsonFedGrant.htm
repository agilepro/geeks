<h2>Robertson's Operation Blessing Receives $500,000 Federal Grant</h2>
Associated Press, 10/3/2002
<p>A charity founded by Pat Robertson is to receive $500,000 in the first wave
of grants under President Bush's "faith-based initiative," which the
religious broadcaster had criticized.
<p>The money for Virginia Beach-based Operation Blessing International was
among $25 million in Compassion Capital Fund grants that were announced
Thursday for 21 groups, including several that are deeply religious in
nature as well as traditional social service providers.
<p>The grants are the first tangible result of the "faith-based initiative,"
which stalled in Congress amid debate over how religious programs can get
government money without running afoul of the constitutional separation of
church and state. In March, Robertson said on his "700 Club" television
show that the program to give federal money to religious organizations that
provide social services was a "Pandora's box" that could make legitimate
religious charities dependent on government and finance cults that
"brainwash" prospective adherents.
<p>Robertson said the groups getting funds "will begin to be nurtured, if I
can use that term, on federal money, and then they can't get off of it,"
according to The Washington Post. He added, "It'll be like a narcotic; they
can't then free themselves later on…"
<p>The Council on American-Islamic Relations, an Islamic civil rights and
advocacy group, issued a statement Thursday saying Robertson should not
receive the grant because of comments he has made about Islam.
<p>For example, in 1997, Muslim leaders demanded that Robertson apologize for
saying on his program that converting to Islam "is nothing short of
insanity" because it is the religion of those who sold Africans into
slavery. A spokeswoman said at the time that Robertson's remarks were taken
out of context.
<p>"Anyone who exhibits such bigoted views is unworthy to receive taxpayer
dollars," CAIR Executive Director Nihad Awad said. "Mr. Robertson should be
repudiated, not rewarded, for his Islamophobic hate speech…"
