<h2 align=center>Poverty-Stricken Africans Receive Desperately Needed Bibles</h2>

<p>MARADI, NIGER—More than 60,000 urgently needed Bibles arrived to
allay suffering throughout the famine-stricken nation of Niger
Friday, in one of the largest humanitarian-relief operations ever
attempted by a Christian ministry.</p>

<p>"Come rejoice, and feast upon the word of Our Lord, Jesus
Christ," said Christina Clarkson, executive director of the Living
Light Ministries of Lubbock, TX. "Those who were hungry, hunger no
more, for the Word brings life."
<p>An exuberant Clarkson said the Bible drop was the culmination of
one of the largest and most aggressive grassroots fundraising drives
ever undertaken by the organization, which was able to fund the
mission largely through local charitable events, such as bake-offs,
barbecues, and pie-eating contests.
<p>"We absolutely would not be here today if it were not for the
amazing generosity of the people back home," Clarkson said. "People
everywhere opened up their hearts and checkbooks to us and said,
'Dig in.'"
<p>Niger, ranked as the second-poorest nation on Earth, is
experiencing its worst famine in more than 20 years, as a brutal
drought last year was followed by a plague of crop-destroying
locusts. An estimated 3.5 million of Niger's 12 million people are
currently at risk of starvation.
<p>"That's why it was so important for this mission to happen right
now," said Clarkson. "So many people here are suffering. Disease,
starvation, and lack of shelter are day-to-day realities in Niger.
But once they hear the Good News of Jesus Christ and accept Him as
their Lord and Savior—once they really take Him into their
hearts—then they will see what poor comforts are the things of this
world."
<p>Due to the tireless efforts of Clarkson and other members of the
congregation, the ministry was able to provide the needy with Bibles
superior to the ones they use in their own church services.
<p>"Handcrafted, genuine leather—best money can buy," said
61-year-old missionary Don Kostic as he ran his hand along the
book's ornately embossed spine. "It's like my wife back home says:
Nothing is too good for people who are ready to receive the Living
Word of Christ."
<p>Although the fundraising efforts were unprecedented, congregation
members said Living Light would never have succeeded had they not
obtained the generous support of an array of corporate sponsors,
including Applebee's and Church's Fried Chicken.
<p>"We spent so much money just to get here," Kostic continued.
"After we had all the Bibles engraved, we still had to charter the
plane. When we landed in Niamey, we could barely even afford ground
transportation."
<p>Undaunted, the missionaries purchased the best vehicle they could
find, which turned out to be a used bread truck. "That old thing!"
recalled Kostic, laughing. "We must've scrubbed it down a hundred
times. You couldn't get the smell of freshly baked,
vitamin-fortified bread out of it if your life depended on it."
<p>Reaction among Niger residents has been mixed.
<p>Moussa Yaouli, a 35-year-old farmer, was particularly interested
to learn more about the doctrine of transubstantiation, which Living
Light personnel told him involved the eating of wafers. "It is said
to be a big wafer. I am sure it will feed many of my children."

<p>Though "spiritually gratified" by their work, many of the
missionaries spoke about the difficulties of working in an
impoverished country.
<p>"It can be so hard being away from the comfort of our homes and
our loving families," Clarkson confided. "I will admit, there have
been times when I prayed, 'Lord, just help me get through this
mission and get me back to Texas!' But when we rolled into town and
people started running after the truck with those big smiles on
their faces, I couldn't help but smile back."
<p>Clarkson added: "And when we opened up the back of the truck and
they saw that it was full of Bibles... Grown men and women wept in
front of their children. That's how moved they were by the Holy
Spirit. That's how I know it's all been worth it."
<p>Clarkson said her mission will succeed in bringing the people of
Niger "the spiritual sustenance they've been deprived of," despite
such obstacles as the nation's 18 percent literacy rate.
<p>"You say you're suffering. I say, let the good Lord do the
suffering for you," she said. "You say you're exhibiting the
deleterious effects of severe dehydration and chronic malnutrition.
And I say that no matter what ails you, the Holy Bible is the best
medicine there is."<p><br><b><a href=http://www.theonion.com>The Onion</a> is not intended for readers under 18 years of age.</b>
