<h2 align="center">The Christian Heritage</h2>
<p class="bodytext" align="justify">Listed are only events that solely occurred
on command or participation of church authorities or were committed in the name
of Christianity. (List incomplete)<p>
<h3>Ancient Pagans</h3>
* As soon as Christianity became legal in the Roman Empire by imperial edict
(315), more and more pagan temples were destroyed by Christian mob. Pagan
priests were killed.<br>
* Between 315 and 6th century thousands of pagan believers were slain.<br>
* Examples of destroyed Temples: the Sanctuary of Aesculap in Aegaea, the Temple
of Aphrodite in Golgatha, Aphaka in Lebanon, the Heliopolis.<br>
* Christian priests such as Mark of Arethusa or Cyrill of Heliopolis were famous
as "temple destroyers." [DA468]<br>
* Pagan services became punishable by death in 356. [DA468]<br>
* Christian Emperor Theodosius (408-450) even had children executed, because
they had been playing with remains of pagan statues. [DA469]<br>
According to Christian chroniclers he "followed meticulously all Christian
teachings..."<br>
* In 6th century pagans were declared void of all rights.<br>
* In the early fourth century the philosopher Sopatros was executed on demand of
Christian authorities. [DA466]<br>
* The world famous female philosopher Hypatia of Alexandria was torn to pieces
with glass fragments by a hysterical Christian mob led by a Christian minister
named Peter, in a church, in 415. [DO19-25]<p>
<h3>Mission</h3>
* Emperor Karl (Charlemagne) in 782 had 4500 Saxons, unwilling to convert to
Christianity, beheaded. [DO30]<br>
* Peasants of Steding (Germany) unwilling to pay suffocating church taxes:
between 5,000 and 11,000 men, women and children slain 5/27/1234 near Altenesch/Germany.
[WW223]<br>
* 15th century Poland: 1019 churches and 17987 villages plundered by Knights of
the Order. Number of victims unknown. [DO30]<br>
* 16th and 17th century Ireland. English troops "pacified and civilized"
Ireland, where only Gaelic "wild Irish", "unreasonable beasts lived without any
knowledge of God or good manners, in common of their goods, cattle, women,
children and every other thing." One of the more successful soldiers, a certain
Humphrey Gilbert, half-brother of Sir Walter Raleigh, ordered that "the heddes
of all those (of what sort soever thei were) which were killed in the daie,
should be cutte off from their bodies... and should bee laied on the ground by
eche side of the waie", which effort to civilize the Irish indeed caused "greate
terrour to the people when thei sawe the heddes of their dedde fathers,
brothers, children, kinsfolke, and freinds on the grounde".<br>
Tens of thousands of Gaelic Irish fell victim to the carnage. [SH99, 225]<p>
<h3>Crusades (1095-1291)</h3>
* First Crusade: 1095 on command of pope Urban II. [WW11-41]<br>
* Semlin/Hungary 6/24/96 thousands slain. Wieselburg/Hungary 6/12/96 thousands.
[WW23]<br>
* 9/9/96-9/26/96 Nikaia, Xerigordon (then Turkish), thousands respectively.
[WW25-27]<br>
* Until January 1098 a total of 40 capital cities and 200 castles conquered
(number of slain unknown) [WW30]<br>
* After 6/3/98 Antiochia (then Turkish) conquered, between 10,000 and 60,000
slain. 6/28/98 100,000 Turks (incl. women and children) killed. [WW32-35]<br>
Here the Christians "did no other harm to the women found in [the enemy&#39;s] tents
- save that they ran their lances through their bellies," according to Christian
chronicler Fulcher of Chartres. [EC60]<br>
* Marra (Maraat an-numan) 12/11/98 thousands killed. Because of the subsequent
famine "the already stinking corpses of the enemies were eaten by the
Christians" said chronicler Albert Aquensis. [WW36]<br>
* Jerusalem conquered 7/15/1099 more than 60,000 victims (Jewish, Muslim, men,
women, children). [WW37-40]<br>
In the words of one witness: "there [in front of Solomon&#39;s temple] was such a
carnage that our people were wading ankle-deep in the blood of our foes", and
after that "happily and crying for joy our people marched to our Saviour&#39;s tomb,
to honour it and to pay off our debt of gratitude."<br>
* The Archbishop of Tyre, eye-witness, wrote: "It was impossible to look upon
the vast numbers of the slain without horror; everywhere lay fragments of human
bodies, and the very ground was covered with the blood of the slain. It was not
alone the spectacle of headless bodies and mutilated limbs strewn in all
directions that roused the horror of all who looked upon them. Still more
dreadful was it to gaze upon the victors themselves, dripping with blood from
head to foot, an ominous sight which brought terror to all who met them. It is
reported that within the Temple enclosure alone about ten thousand infidels
perished." [TG79]<br>
* Christian chronicler Eckehard of Aura noted that "even the following summer in
all of Palestine the air was polluted by the stench of decomposition". One
million victims of the first crusade alone. [WW41]<br>
* Battle of Askalon, 8/12/1099. 200,000 heathens slaughtered "in the name of Our
Lord Jesus Christ". [WW45]<br>
* Fourth crusade: 4/12/1204 Constantinople sacked, number of victims unknown,
numerous thousands, many of them Christian. [WW141-148]<br>
* Rest of Crusades in less detail: until the fall of Akkon 1291 probably 20
million victims (in the Holy land and Arab/Turkish areas alone). [WW224]<p>
Note: All figures according to contemporary (Christian) chroniclers.<p>
<h3>Heretics and Atheists</h3>
* Already in 385 C.E. the first Christians, the Spanish Priscillianus and six
followers, were beheaded for heresy in Trier/Germany [DO26]<br>
* Manichaean heresy: a crypto-Christian sect decent enough to practice birth
control (and thus not as irresponsible as faithful Catholics) was exterminated
in huge campaigns all over the Roman empire between 372 C.E. and 444 C.E.
Numerous thousands of victims. [NC]<br>
* Albigensians: the first Crusade intended to slay other Christians. [DO29]<br>
The Albigensians (Cathars) viewed themselves as good Christians, but would not
accept Roman Catholic rule, and taxes, and prohibition of birth control. [NC]<br>
Begin of violence: on command of pope Innocent III (the greatest single mass
murderer prior to the Nazi era) in 1209. BeziÃ©rs (today France) 7/22/1209
destroyed, all the inhabitants were slaughtered. Number of victims (including
Catholics refusing to turn over their heretic neighbors and friends) estimated
between 20,000-70,000. [WW179-181]<br>
* Carcassonne 8/15/1209, thousands slain. Other cities followed. [WW181]<br>
* Subsequent 20 years of war until nearly all Cathars (probably half the
population of the Languedoc, today southern France) were exterminated. [WW183]<br>
* After the war ended (1229) the Inquisition was founded 1232 to search and
destroy surviving/hiding heretics. Last Cathars burned at the stake 1324.
[WW183]<br>
* Estimated one million victims (Cathar heresy alone), [WW183]<br>
* Other heresies: Waldensians, Paulikians, Runcarians, Josephites, and many
others. Most of these sects exterminated, (I believe some Waldensians live
today, yet they had to endure 600 years of persecution) I estimate at least
hundred thousand victims (including the Spanish inquisition but excluding
victims in the New World).<br>
* Spanish Inquisitor Torquemada, a former Dominican friar, allegedly was
responsible for 10,220 burnings. [DO28]<br>
* John Huss, a critic of papal infallibility and indulgences, was burned at the
stake in 1415. [LI475-522]<br>
* Michael Sattler, leader of a baptist community, was burned at the stake in
Rottenburg, Germany, May 20, 1527. Several days later his wife and other
follwers were also executed. [KM]<br>
* University professor B.Hubmaier burned at the stake 1538 in Vienna. [DO59]<br>
* Giordano Bruno, Dominican monk, after having been incarcerated for seven
years, was burned at the stake for heresy on the Campo dei Fiori ( Rome) on
2/17/1600.<br>
* Thomas Aikenhead, a twenty-year-old scottish student of Edinburgh University,
was hanged for atheism and blasphemy on 1/8/1697.<p>
<h3>Witches</h3>
* From the beginning of Christianity to 1484 probably more than several
thousand.<br>
* In the era of witch hunting (1484-1750) according to modern scholars several
hundred thousand (about 80% female) burned at the stake or hanged. [WV]<br>
* Incomplete list of documented cases:<br>
The Burning of Witches - A Chronicle of the Burning Times<p>
<h3>Religious Wars</h3>
* 15th century: Crusades against Hussites, thousands slain. [DO30]<br>
* 1538 pope Paul III declared Crusade against apostate England and all English
as slaves of Church (fortunately had not power to go into action). [DO31]<br>
* 1568 Spanish Inquisition Tribunal ordered extermination of 3 million rebels in
(then Spanish) Netherlands. [DO31]<br>
Between 5000 and 6000 Protestants were drowned by Spanish Catholic Troops, "a
disaster the burghers of Emden first realized when several thousand
broad-brimmed Dutch hats floated by." [SH216]<br>
* 1572 In France about 20,000 Huguenots were killed on command of pope Pius V.
Until 17th century 200,000 flee. [DO31]<br>
* 17th century: Catholics slay Gaspard de Coligny, a Protestant leader. After
murdering him, the Catholic mob mutilated his body, "cutting off his head, his
hands, and his genitals... and then dumped him into the river [...but] then,
deciding that it was not worthy of being food for the fish, they hauled it out
again [... and] dragged what was left ... to the gallows of Montfaulcon, &#39;to be
meat and carrion for maggots and crows&#39;." [SH191]<br>
* 17th century: Catholics sack the city of Magdeburg/Germany: roughly 30,000
Protestants were slain. "In a single church fifty women were found beheaded,"
reported poet Friedrich Schiller, "and infants still sucking the breasts of
their lifeless mothers." [SH191]<br>
* 17th century 30 years&#39; war (Catholic vs. Protestant): at least 40% of
population decimated, mostly in Germany. [DO31-32]<p>
<h3>Jews</h3>
* Already in the 4th and 5th centuries synagogues were burned by Christians.
Number of Jews slain unknown.<br>
* In the middle of the fourth century the first synagogue was destroyed on
command of bishop Innocentius of Dertona in Northern Italy. The first synagogue
known to have been burned down was near the river Euphrat, on command of the
bishop of Kallinikon in the year 388. [DA450]<br>
* 694 17. Council of Toledo: Jews were enslaved, their property confiscated, and
their children forcibly baptized. [DA454]<br>
* 1010 The Bishop of Limoges (France) had the cities&#39; Jews, who would not
convert to Christianity, expelled or killed. [DA453]<br>
* 1096 First Crusade: Thousands of Jews slaughtered, maybe 12.000 total. Places:
Worms 5/18/1096, Mainz 5/27/1096 (1100 persons), Cologne, Neuss, Altenahr,
Wevelinghoven, Xanten, Moers, Dortmund, Kerpen, Trier, Metz, Regensburg, Prag
and others (All locations Germany except Metz/France, Prag/Czech) [EJ]<br>
* 1147 Second Crusade: Several hundred Jews were slain in Ham, Sully, Carentan,
and Rameru (all locations in France). [WW57]<br>
* 1189/90 Third Crusade: English Jewish communities sacked. [DO40]<br>
* 1235, Fulda/Germany: 34 Jewish men and women slain. [DO41]<br>
* 1257, 1267: Jewish communities of London, Canterbury, Northampton, Lincoln,
Cambridge, and others exterminated. [DO41]<br>
* 1290 Bohemia (Poland) allegedly 10,000 Jews killed. [DO41]<br>
* 1337 Starting in Deggendorf/Germany a Jew-killing craze reaches 51 towns in
Bavaria, Austria, Poland. [DO41]<br>
* 1348 All Jews of Basel/Switzerland and Strasbourg/France (two thousand)
burned. [DO41]<br>
* 1349 In more than 350 towns in Germany all Jews murdered, mostly burned alive
(in this one year more Jews were killed than Christians in 200 years of ancient
Roman persecution of Christians). [DO42]<br>
* 1389 In Prag 3,000 Jews were slaughtered. [DO42]<br>
* 1391 Seville&#39;s Jews killed (Archbishop Martinez leading). 4,000 were slain,
25,000 sold as slaves. [DA454] Their identification was made easy by the
brightly colored "badges of shame" that all Jews above the age of ten had been
forced to wear.<br>
* 1492 In the year Columbus set sail to conquer a New World, more than 150,000
Jews were expelled from Spain, many died on their way: 6/30/1492. [MM470-476]<br>
* 1648 Chmielnitzki massacres: In Poland about 200,000 Jews were slain. [DO43]
<p>
(I feel sick ...) this goes on and on, century after century, right into the
kilns of Auschwitz.<p>
<h3>Native Peoples</h3>
* Beginning with Columbus (a former slave trader and would-be Holy Crusader) the
conquest of the New World began, as usual understood as a means to propagate
Christianity.<br>
* Within hours of landfall on the first inhabited island he encountered in the
Caribbean, Columbus seized and carried off six native people who, he said,
"ought to be good servants ... [and] would easily be made Christians, because it
seemed to me that they belonged to no religion." [SH200]<br>
While Columbus described the Indians as "idolators" and "slaves, as many as [the
Crown] shall order," his pal Michele de Cuneo, Italian nobleman, referred to the
natives as "beasts" because "they eat when they are hungry," and made love
"openly whenever they feel like it." [SH204-205]<br>
* On every island he set foot on, Columbus planted a cross, "making the
declarations that are required" - the requerimiento - to claim the ownership for
his Catholic patrons in Spain. And "nobody objected." If the Indians refused or
delayed their acceptance (or understanding), the requerimiento continued:<p>
"I certify to you that, with the help of God, we shall powerfully enter in your
country and shall make war against you ... and shall subject you to the yoke and
obedience of the Church ... and shall do you all mischief that we can, as to
vassals who do not obey and refuse to receive their lord and resist and
contradict him." [SH66]<p>
* Likewise in the words of John Winthrop, first governor of Massachusetts Bay
Colony: "justifieinge the undertakeres of the intended Plantation in New England
... to carry the Gospell into those parts of the world, ... and to raise a
Bulworke against the kingdome of the Ante-Christ." [SH235]<br>
* In average two thirds of the native population were killed by
colonist-imported smallpox before violence began. This was a great sign of "the
marvelous goodness and providence of God" to the Christians of course, e.g. the
Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony wrote in 1634, as "for the natives,
they are near all dead of the smallpox, so as the Lord hath cleared our title to
what we possess." [SH109,238]<br>
* On Hispaniola alone, on Columbus visits, the native population (Arawak), a
rather harmless and happy people living on an island of abundant natural
resources, a literal paradise, soon mourned 50,000 dead. [SH204]<br>
* The surviving Indians fell victim to rape, murder, enslavement and Spanish
raids.<br>
* As one of the culprits wrote: "So many Indians died that they could not be
counted, all through the land the Indians lay dead everywhere. The stench was
very great and pestiferous." [SH69]<br>
* The Indian chief Hatuey fled with his people but was captured and burned
alive. As "they were tying him to the stake a Franciscan friar urged him to take
Jesus to his heart so that his soul might go to heaven, rather than descend into
hell. Hatuey replied that if heaven was where the Christians went, he would
rather go to hell." [SH70]<br>
* What happened to his people was described by an eyewitness:<br>
"The Spaniards found pleasure in inventing all kinds of odd cruelties ... They
built a long gibbet, long enough for the toes to touch the ground to prevent
strangling, and hanged thirteen [natives] at a time in honor of Christ Our
Saviour and the twelve Apostles... then, straw was wrapped around their torn
bodies and they were burned alive." [SH72]<br>
Or, on another occasion:<br>
"The Spaniards cut off the arm of one, the leg or hip of another, and from some
their heads at one stroke, like butchers cutting up beef and mutton for market.
Six hundred, including the cacique, were thus slain like brute beasts...Vasco
[de Balboa] ordered forty of them to be torn to pieces by dogs." [SH83]<br>
* The "island&#39;s population of about eight million people at the time of
Columbus&#39;s arrival in 1492 already had declined by a third to a half before the
year 1496 was out." Eventually all the island&#39;s natives were exterminated, so
the Spaniards were "forced" to import slaves from other caribbean islands, who
soon suffered the same fate. Thus "the Caribbean&#39;s millions of native people
[were] thereby effectively liquidated in barely a quarter of a century".
[SH72-73] "In less than the normal lifetime of a single human being, an entire
culture of millions of people, thousands of years resident in their homeland,
had been exterminated." [SH75]<br>
* "And then the Spanish turned their attention to the mainland of Mexico and
Central America. The slaughter had barely begun. The exquisite city of
TenochtitlÃ¡n [Mexico city] was next." [SH75]<br>
* Cortez, Pizarro, De Soto and hundreds of other Spanish conquistadors likewise
sacked southern and mesoamerican civilizations in the name of Christ ( De Soto
also sacked Florida).<br>
* "When the 16th century ended, some 200,000 Spaniards had moved to the
Americas. By that time probably more than 60,000,000 natives were dead." [SH95]<p>
Of course no different were the founders of what today is the US of America.<p>
* Although none of the settlers would have survived winter without native help,
they soon set out to expel and exterminate the Indians. Warfare among (north
American) Indians was rather harmless, in comparison to European standards, and
was meant to avenge insults rather than conquer land. In the words of some of
the pilgrim fathers: "Their Warres are farre less bloudy...", so that there
usually was "no great slawter of nether side". Indeed, "they might fight seven
yeares and not kill seven men." What is more, the Indians usually spared women
and children. [SH111]<br>
* In the spring of 1612 some English colonists found life among the (generally
friendly and generous) natives attractive enough to leave Jamestown - "being
idell ... did runne away unto the Indyans," - to live among them (that probably
solved a sex problem).<br>
"Governor Thomas Dale had them hunted down and executed: &#39;Some he apointed (sic)
to be hanged Some burned Some to be broken upon wheles, others to be staked and
some shott to deathe&#39;." [SH105] Of course these elegant measures were restricted
for fellow Englishmen: "This was the treatment for those who wished to act like
Indians. For those who had no choice in the matter, because they were the native
people of Virginia" methods were different: "when an Indian was accused by an
Englishman of stealing a cup and failing to return it, the English response was
to attack the natives in force, burning the entire community" down. [SH105]<br>
* On the territory that is now Massachusetts the founding fathers of the
colonies were committing genocide, in what has become known as the "Peqout War."
The killers were New England Puritan Christians, refugees from persecution in
their own home country England.<br>
* When however, a dead colonist was found, apparently killed by Narragansett
Indians, the Puritan colonists wanted revenge. Despite the Indian chief&#39;s pledge
they attacked.<br>
Somehow they seem to have lost the idea of what they were after, because when
they were greeted by Pequot Indians (long-time foes of the Narragansetts) the
troops nevertheless made war on the Pequots and burned their villages.<br>
The puritan commander-in-charge John Mason after one massacre wrote: "And indeed
such a dreadful Terror did the Almighty let fall upon their Spirits, that they
would fly from us and run into the very Flames, where many of them perished ...
God was above them, who laughed his Enemies and the Enemies of his People to
Scorn, making them as a fiery Oven ... Thus did the Lord judge among the
Heathen, filling the Place with dead Bodies": men, women, children. [SH113-114]<br>
* So "the Lord was pleased to smite our Enemies in the hinder Parts, and to give
us their land for an inheritance". [SH111].<br>
* Because of his readers&#39; assumed knowledge of Deuteronomy, there was no need
for Mason to quote the words that immediately follow:<br>
"Thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth. But thou shalt utterly destroy
them..." (Deut 20)<br>
* Mason&#39;s comrade Underhill recalled how "great and doleful was the bloody sight
to the view of the young soldiers" yet reassured his readers that "sometimes the
Scripture declareth women and children must perish with their parents". [SH114]<br>
* Other Indians were killed in successful plots of poisoning. The colonists even
had dogs especially trained to kill Indians and to devour children from their
mothers breasts, in the colonists&#39; own words: "blood Hounds to draw after them,
and Mastives to seaze them." (This was inspired by Spanish methods of the time)<br>
In this way they continued until the extermination of the Pequots was near.
[SH107-119]<br>
* The surviving handful of Indians "were parceled out to live in servitude. John
Endicott and his pastor wrote to the governor asking for &#39;a share&#39; of the
captives, specifically &#39;a young woman or girle and a boy if you thinke good&#39;."
[SH115]<br>
* Other tribes were to follow the same path.<br>
* Comment the Christian exterminators: "God&#39;s Will, which will at last give us
cause to say: How Great is His Goodness! and How Great is his Beauty!"<br>
"Thus doth the Lord Jesus make them to bow before him, and to lick the Dust!"
[TA]<br>
* Like today, lying was morally acceptable to Christians then. "Peace treaties
were signed with every intention to violate them: when the Indians &#39;grow secure
uppon (sic) the treatie&#39;, advised the Council of State in Virginia, &#39;we shall
have the better Advantage both to surprise them, &amp; cutt downe theire Corne&#39;."
[SH106]<br>
* In 1624 sixty heavily armed Englishmen cut down 800 defenseless Indian men,
women and children. [SH107]<br>
* In a single massacre in "King Philip&#39;s War" of 1675 and 1676 some "600 Indians
were destroyed. A delighted Cotton Mather, revered pastor of the Second Church
in Boston, later referred to the slaughter as a &#39;barbeque&#39;." [SH115]<br>
* To summarize: Before the arrival of the English, the western Abenaki people in
New Hampshire and Vermont had numbered 12,000. Less than half a century later
about 250 remained alive - a destruction rate of 98%. The Pocumtuck people had
numbered more than 18,000, fifty years later they were down to 920 - 95%
destroyed. The Quiripi-Unquachog people had numbered about 30,000, fifty years
later they were down to 1500 - 95% destroyed. The Massachusetts people had
numbered at least 44,000, fifty years later barely 6000 were alive - 81%
destroyed. [SH118] These are only a few examples of the multitude of tribes
living before Christian colonists set their foot on the New World. All this was
before the smallpox epidemics of 1677 and 1678 had occurred. And the carnage was
not over then.<br>
* All the above was only the beginning of the European colonization, it was
before the frontier age actually had begun.<br>
* A total of maybe more than 150 million Indians (of both Americas) were
destroyed in the period of 1500 to 1900, as an average two thirds by smallpox
and other epidemics, that leaves some 50 million killed directly by violence,
bad treatment and slavery.<br>
* In many countries, such as Brazil, and Guatemala, this continues even today.<p>
<h3>More Glorious Events in U.S. History</h3>
* Reverend Solomon Stoddard, one of New England &#39;s most esteemed religious
leaders, in "1703 formally proposed to the Massachusetts Governor that the
colonists be given the financial wherewithal to purchase and train large packs
of dogs &#39;to hunt Indians as they do bears&#39;." [SH241]<br>
* Massacre of Sand Creek, Colorado 11/29/1864. Colonel John Chivington, a former
Methodist minister and still elder in the church ("I long to be wading in gore")
had a Cheyenne village of about 600, mostly women and children, gunned down
despite the chiefs&#39; waving with a white flag: 400-500 killed.<br>
From an eye-witness account: "There were some thirty or forty squaws collected
in a hole for protection; they sent out a little girl about six years old with a
white flag on a stick; she had not proceeded but a few steps when she was shot
and killed. All the squaws in that hole were afterwards killed ..." [SH131]<br>
More gory details.<br>
* By the 1860s, "in Hawai&#39;i the Reverend Rufus Anderson surveyed the carnage
that by then had reduced those islands&#39; native population by 90 percent or more,
and he declined to see it as tragedy; the expected total die-off of the Hawaiian
population was only natural, this missionary said, somewhat equivalent to &#39;the
amputation of diseased members of the body&#39;." [SH244]<p>
<h3>20th Century Church Atrocities</h3>
* Catholic extermination camps<br>
Surprisingly few know that Nazi extermination camps in World War II were by no
means the only ones in Europe at the time. In the years 1942-1943 also in
Croatia existed numerous extermination camps, run by Catholic Ustasha under
their dictator Ante PaveliÃ§, a practicing Catholic and regular visitor to the
then pope. There were even concentration camps exclusively for children!<br>
In these camps - the most notorious was Jasenovac, headed by a Franciscan friar
- orthodox-Christian Serbians (and a substantial number of Jews) were murdered.
Like the Nazis the Catholic Ustasha burned their victims in kilns, alive (the
Nazis were decent enough to have their victims gassed first). But most of the
victims were simply stabbed, slain or shot to death, the number of them being
estimated between 300,000 and 600,000, in a rather tiny country. Many of the
killers were Franciscan friars. The atrocities were appalling enough to induce
bystanders of the Nazi "Sicherheitsdienst der SS", watching, to complain about
them to Hitler (who did not listen). The pope knew about these events and did
nothing to prevent them. [MV]<br>
* Catholic terror in Vietnam<br>
In 1954 Vietnamese freedom fighters - the Viet Minh - had finally defeated the
French colonial government in North Vietnam, which by then had been supported by
U.S. funds amounting to more than $2 billion. Although the victorious assured
religious freedom to all (most non-Buddhist Vietnamese were Catholics), due to
huge anticommunist propaganda campaigns many Catholics fled to the South. With
the help of Catholic lobbies in Washington and Cardinal Spellman, the Vatican&#39;s
spokesman in U.S. politics, who later on would call the U.S. forces in Vietnam
"Soldiers of Christ", a scheme was concocted to prevent democratic elections
which could have brought the communist Viet Minh to power in the South as well,
and the fanatic Catholic Ngo Dinh Diem was made president of South Vietnam.
[MW16ff]<br>
Diem saw to it that U.S. aid, food, technical and general assistance was given
to Catholics alone, Buddhist individuals and villages were ignored or had to pay
for the food aids which were given to Catholics for free. The only religious
denomination to be supported was Roman Catholicism.<br>
The Vietnamese McCarthyism turned even more vicious than its American
counterpart. By 1956 Diem promulgated a presidential order which read:<p>
"Individuals considered dangerous to the national defense and common security
may be confined by executive order, to a concentration camp."<p>
Supposedly to fight communism, thousands of Buddhist protesters and monks were
imprisoned in "detention camps." Out of protest dozens of Buddhist teachers -
male and female - and monks poured gasoline over themselves and burned
themselves. ( Note that Buddhists burned themselves: in comparison Christians
tend to burn others). Meanwhile some of the prison camps, which in the meantime
were filled with Protestant and even Catholic protesters as well, had turned
into no-nonsense death camps. It is estimated that during this period of terror
(1955-1960) at least 24,000 were wounded - mostly in street riots - 80,000
people were executed, 275,000 had been detained or tortured, and about 500,000
were sent to concentration or detention camps. [MW76-89].<br>
To support this kind of government in the next decade thousands of American GI&#39;s
lost their life.<p>
* Christianity kills the cat<br>
On July 1, 1976, Anneliese Michel, a 23-year-old student of a teachers college
in Germany, died: she starved herself to death. For months she had been haunted
by demonic visions and apparitions, and for months two Catholic priests - with
explicit approval of the Catholic bishop of WÃ¼rzburg - additionally pestered and
tormented the wretched girl with their exorcist rituals. After her death in
Klingenberg hospital - her body was littered with wounds - her parents, both of
them fanatical Catholics, were sentenced to six months for not having called for
medical help. None of the priests was punished: on the contrary, Miss Michel&#39;s
grave today is a place of pilgrimage and worship for a number of similarly
faithful Catholics (in the seventeenth century WÃ¼rzburg was notorious for it&#39;s
extensive witch burnings).<br>
This case is only the tip of an iceberg of such evil superstition and has become
known only because of its lethal outcome. [SP80]<br>
* Rwanda Massacres<br>
In 1994 in the small African country of Rwanda in just a few months several
hundred thousand civilians were butchered, apparently a conflict of the Hutu and
Tutsi ethnic groups.<br>
For quite some time I heard only rumors about Catholic clergy actively involved
in the 1994 Rwanda massacres. Odd denials of involvement were printed in
Catholic church journals, before even anybody had openly accused members of the
church.<br>
Then, 10/10/96, in the newscast of S2 Aktuell, Germany - a station not at all
critical to Christianity - the following was stated:<p>
"Anglican as well as Catholic priests and nuns are suspect of having actively
participated in murders. Especially the conduct of a certain Catholic priest has
been occupying the public mind in Rwanda&#39;s capital Kigali for months. He was
minister of the church of the Holy Family and allegedly murdered Tutsis in the
most brutal manner. He is reported to have accompanied marauding Hutu militia
with a gun in his cowl. In fact there has been a bloody slaughter of Tutsis
seeking shelter in his parish. Even two years after the massacres many Catholics
refuse to set foot on the threshold of their church, because to them the
participation of a certain part of the clergy in the slaughter is well
established. There is almost no church in Rwanda that has not seen refugees -
women, children, old - being brutally butchered facing the crucifix.<br>
According to eyewitnesses clergymen gave away hiding Tutsis and turned them over
to the machetes of the Hutu militia.<br>
In connection with these events again and again two Benedictine nuns are
mentioned, both of whom have fled into a Belgian monastery in the meantime to
avoid prosecution. According to survivors one of them called the Hutu killers
and led them to several thousand people who had sought shelter in her monastery.
By force the doomed were driven out of the churchyard and were murdered in the
presence of the nun right in front of the gate. The other one is also reported
to have directly cooperated with the murderers of the Hutu militia. In her case
again witnesses report that she watched the slaughtering of people in cold blood
and without showing response. She is even accused of having procured some petrol
used by the killers to set on fire and burn their victims alive..." [S2]<p>
More recently the BBC aired:<p>
Priests get death sentence for Rwandan genocide<br>
BBC NEWS April 19, 1998<p>
A court in Rwanda has sentenced two Roman Catholic priests to death for their
role in the genocide of 1994, in which up to a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus
were killed. Pope John Paul said the priests must be made to account for their
actions. Different sections of the Rwandan church have been widely accused of
playing an active role in the genocide of 1994...<p>
* As can be seen from these events, to Christianity the Dark Ages never come to
an end.<p>
If today Christians talk to me about morality, this is why they make me sick.<br>
