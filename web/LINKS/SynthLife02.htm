<p>When scientists announced on Jan. 24 that they had
reconstituted the complete set of genes for a microbe
using just a few bottles of chemicals, the feat was
hailed as a kind of shining Nike moment in the field of
synthetic biology, the attempt to piece together living
organisms from inert scratch.
<p>Reporting in the journal Science,
<a title="More articles about J. Craig Venter." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/v/j_craig_venter/index.html?inline=nyt-per">
Dr. J. Craig Venter</a> and his colleagues at the J. Craig
Venter Institute said they had fabricated the entire DNA
chain of a microbial parasite called Mycoplasma
genitalium, exceeding previous records of sustained DNA
synthesis by some 18-fold. Any day now, the researchers
say, they will pop that manufactured mortal coil into a
cellular shell, where the genomic code will “boot up,”
as Dr. Venter puts it, and the entire construct will
begin acting like a natural-born M. genitalium — minus
the capacity, the researchers promise, to infect the
delicate tissues that explain the parasite’s surname.<p>
Yet even as researchers rhapsodize about gaining the
power to custom-design organisms that will supply us
with rivers of cheap gasoline, better chemotherapeutic
agents or — here’s my latest fantasy — a year-round
supply of fresh eggnog, the most profound insights to
emerge from the pursuit of synthetic life just may be
about real life.
<p>Scientists who seek to imitate living cells say they
can’t help but be perpetually dazzled by the genuine
articles, their flexibility, their versatility, their
childlike grandiosity. No matter what outrageous or
fattening things we may ask our synthetic cells to do,
scientists say, it’s nothing compared with what cells
already have done of their own accord, usually in the
format of bacteria. Microbes have been found to survive
and even thrive in places where if they had any sense
they would freeze, melt, explode, disintegrate, starve,
suffocate, or at the very least file a very poor
customer review.
<p>“We have micro-organisms that live in such strong
acid or base solutions that if you put your finger in,
the skin would dissolve almost instantly,” Dr. Venter
said in an interview. “There’s another organism that can
take three million rads of radiation and not be killed.”
How can a microbe withstand a blast of radioactivity
that is a good 1,500 times greater than what would kill
any of us virtually on the spot? “Its chromosome gets
blown apart,” Dr. Venter said, “but it stitches
everything back together and just starts replicating
again.”
<p>Given the wealth of biological and metabolic
templates that nature has invented over nearly four
billion years of evolutionary tinkering, scientists say,
any sane program to synthesize new life forms must go
hand in hand with a sustained sampling of the old. “My
view is that we know less than 1 percent of what’s out
there in the biological universe,” Dr. Venter said.
<p>Last year, he and his colleagues went prospecting for
new organisms in the deep midocean, long thought to be
one of earth’s least animate regions. Sure, life evolved
in the seas, but shallow seas, where sunlight can
penetrate, were considered the preferred site for
biodiversity. Even with the startling discovery in the
1980s of life on the ocean floor, around the
hydrothermal vents, the midocean waters couldn’t shake
their reputation as an impoverished piece of real
estate: too far down for
<a title="More articles about Solar Energy." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/solar_energy/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">
solar energy</a>, too high up for its geothermal
equivalent.
<p>Yet when the Venter team began sampling the waters
for the most basic evidence of life, the presence of
genetic material, they found themselves practically
awash in novel DNA. “From our random sequencing in the
ocean, we uncovered six million new genes,” he said,
genes, that is, unlike any yet seen in any of the
mammals, reptiles, worms, fish, insects, fungi, microbes
or narcissists that have been genetically analyzed so
far. With just that first-pass act of nautical
sequencing, Dr. Venter said, “we doubled the number of
all genes characterized to date.”
<p>Researchers assume that most of the novel DNA is
microbial in origin, but they have yet to identify the
organisms or see what they can do, because most microbes
are notoriously difficult to cultivate in the lab.
Bacteria may happily swim through toxic waste, but when
it comes to confinement on an agar plate, thank you,
they’d rather be dead.
<p>Technical challenges notwithstanding, scientists have
made some progress in investigating preposterous life
forms and tallying the biochemical tools that such
extremophiles use. Thermophilic microbes, for example,
which can withstand temperatures of 238 degrees
Fahrenheit, well above the boiling point of water, have
stiffening agents in their membranes, to keep them from
melting away, and they build their cell proteins with a
different assortment of amino acids than our cells do,
allowing the construction of strongly bonded protein
chains that won’t collapse in the heat.
<p>By contrast, said Steven K. Schmidt, a microbiologist
at the University of Colorado in Boulder, when you look at
organisms that thrive in subzero conditions, “their
membranes are really loosey-goosey, very fluid,” and so
resist stiffening and freezing. It turns out there are a
lot of these loosey-gooses around. Dr. Schmidt and his
colleagues study the fridgophile life forms that make
their home in glacial debris high in the Andes
Mountains, 20,000 feet above sea level, where the scene
may look bleak, beyond posthumous, but where, he said,
“we’ve been pretty amazed at the extreme diversity of
things we’ve found.” The complexity of the Andean
microbial ecosystem, he said, “is greater than what
you’d find in your garden.”
<p>Yes, microbes were here first, and they’ve done
everything first, and synthetic lifers are happy to
scavenge for parts and ideas. Drew Endy, an assistant
professor in the biological engineering department at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and his
colleagues are putting together a registry of
standardized biological parts, which they call BioBrick
parts. The registry consists of the DNA code for
different biological modules, interchangeable protein
parts that they hope may someday be pieced together into
a wide variety of biological devices to perform any task
a bioengineer may have in mind, rather like the way
nuts, bolts, gears, pulleys, circuits and the like are
assembled into the machines of our civilization.
Numbering some 2,000 parts and growing, the registry
contains many recipes for clever protein modules
invented by bacteria. One sequence engineered by
researchers in Melbourne, Australia, encodes the
instructions for a little protein balloon, for example.
“It’s based on a natural part found in a marine
micro-organism that controls the buoyancy of the cell,”
Dr. Endy said.
<p>Invisible though it may be, the microbial community
ever keeps us afloat.
