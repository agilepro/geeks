<h2>Feel the Hate</h2>

<p>"I don't know where George Soros gets his money," one man said.
"I don't know where - if it comes from overseas or from drug groups or
where it comes from." George Soros, another declared, "wants to spend
$75 million defeating <ALT-CODE idsrc="nyt-per-pol" value="Bush, George W" />
George W. Bush because Soros wants to legalize heroin." After all, a third
said, Mr. Soros "is a self-admitted atheist; he was a Jew who figured out a
way to survive the Holocaust."
<p>They aren't LaRouchies - they're Republicans.
<p>The suggestion that Mr. Soros, who has spent billions promoting democracy
around the world, is in the pay of drug cartels came from Dennis Hastert, the
speaker of the House, whom the Constitution puts two heartbeats from the
presidency. After standing by his remarks for several days, Mr. Hastert finally
claimed that he was talking about how Mr. Soros spends his money, not where he
gets it.
<p>The claim that Mr. Soros's political spending is driven by his desire to
legalize heroin came from Newt Gingrich. And the bit about the Holocaust came
from Tony Blankley, editorial page editor of The Washington Times, which has
become the administration's de facto house organ.
<p>For many months we've been warned by tut-tutting commentators about the evils
of irrational "Bush hatred." Pundits eagerly scanned the Democratic
convention for the disease; some invented examples when they failed to find it.
Then they waited eagerly for outrageous behavior by demonstrators in New York,
only to be disappointed again.
<p>There was plenty of hatred in Manhattan, but it was inside, not outside,
Madison Square Garden.
<p>Barack Obama, who gave the Democratic keynote address, delivered a message of
uplift and hope. Zell Miller, who gave the Republican keynote, declared that
political opposition is treason: "Now, at the same time young Americans are
dying in the sands of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan, our nation is being
torn apart and made weaker because of the Democrats' manic obsession to bring
down our commander in chief." And the crowd roared its approval.
<p>Why are the Republicans so angry? One reason is that they have nothing
positive to run on (during the first three days, Mr. Bush was mentioned far less
often than <ALT-CODE idsrc="nyt-per-pol" value="Kerry, John F" />
John Kerry).
<p>The promised economic boom hasn't materialized, Iraq is a bloody quagmire,
and Osama bin Laden has gone from "dead or alive" to
he-who-must-not-be-named.
<p>Another reason, I'm sure, is a guilty conscience. At some level the people at
that convention know that their designated hero is a man who never in his life
took a risk or made a sacrifice for his country, and that they are impugning the
patriotism of men who have.
<p>That's why Band-Aids with Purple Hearts on them, mocking Mr. Kerry's war
wounds and medals, have been such a hit with conventioneers, and why senior
politicians are attracted to wild conspiracy theories about Mr. Soros.
<p>It's also why Mr. Hastert, who knows how little the Bush administration has
done to protect New York and help it rebuild, has accused the city of an
"unseemly scramble" for cash after 9/11. Nothing makes you hate people
as much as knowing in your heart that you are in the wrong and they are in the
right.
<p>But the vitriol also reflects the fact that many of the people at that
convention, for all their flag-waving, hate America. They want a controlled,
monolithic society; they fear and loathe our nation's freedom, diversity and
complexity.
<p>The convention opened with an invocation by Sheri Dew, a Mormon publisher and
activist. Early rumors were that the invocation would be given by Jerry Falwell,
who suggested just after 9/11 that the attack was God's punishment for the
activities of the A.C.L.U. and People for the American Way, among others. But
Ms. Dew is no more moderate: earlier this year she likened opposition to gay
marriage to opposition to Hitler.
<p>The party made sure to put social moderates like Rudy Giuliani in front of
the cameras. But in private events, the story was different. For example,
Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas told Republicans that we are in a "culture
war" and urged a reduction in the separation of church and state.
<p>Mr. Bush, it's now clear, intends to run a campaign based on fear. And for
me, at least, it's working: thinking about what these people will do if they
solidify their grip on power makes me very, very afraid.
