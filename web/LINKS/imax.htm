<h2>A New Screen Test for Imax: It's the Bible vs. the Volcano</h2>

<p>The fight over evolution has reached the big, big screen.
<p>Several Imax theaters, including some in science museums, are refusing to
show movies that mention the subject - or the Big Bang or the geology of the
earth - fearing protests from people who object to films that contradict
biblical descriptions of the origin of Earth and its creatures.
<p>The number of theaters rejecting such films is small, people in the industry
say - perhaps a dozen or fewer, most in the South. But because only a few dozen
Imax theaters routinely show science documentaries, the decisions of a few can
have a big impact on a film's bottom line - or a producer's decision to make a
documentary in the first place.
<p>People who follow trends at commercial and institutional Imax theaters say
that in recent years, religious controversy has adversely affected the
distribution of a number of films, including "Cosmic Voyage," which
depicts the universe in dimensions running from the scale of subatomic particles
to clusters of galaxies; "Galápagos," about the islands where Darwin
theorized about evolution; and "Volcanoes of the Deep Sea," an
underwater epic about the bizarre creatures that flourish in the hot, sulfurous
emanations from vents in the ocean floor.
<p>"Volcanoes," released in 2003 and sponsored in part by the National
Science Foundation and Rutgers University, has been turned down at about a dozen
science centers, mostly in the South, said Dr. Richard Lutz, the Rutgers
oceanographer who was chief scientist for the film. He said theater officials
rejected the film because of its brief references to evolution, in particular to
the possibility that life on Earth originated at the undersea vents.
<p>Carol Murray, director of marketing for the Fort Worth Museum of Science and
History, said the museum decided not to offer the movie after showing it to a
sample audience, a practice often followed by managers of Imax theaters. Ms.
Murray said 137 people participated in the survey, and while some thought it was
well done, "some people said it was blasphemous."
<p>In their written comments, she explained, they made statements like "I
really hate it when the theory of evolution is presented as fact," or
"I don't agree with their presentation of human existence."
<p>On other criteria, like narration and music, the film did not score as well
as other films, Ms. Murray said, and over all, it did not receive high marks, so
she recommended that the museum pass.
<p>"If it's not going to draw a crowd and it is going to create
controversy," she said, "from a marketing standpoint I cannot make a
recommendation" to show it.
<p>In interviews, officials at other Imax theaters said they had similarly
decided against the film for fear of offending some audiences.
<p>"We have definitely a lot more creation public than evolution
public," said Lisa Buzzelli, who directs the Charleston Imax Theater in
South Carolina, a commercial theater next to the Charleston Aquarium. Her
theater had not ruled out ever showing "Volcanoes," Ms. Buzzelli said,
"but being in the Bible Belt, the movie does have a lot to do with
evolution, and we weigh that carefully."
<p>Pietro Serapiglia, who handles distribution for the producer Stephen Low of
Montreal, whose company made the film, said officials at other theaters told him
they could not book the movie "for religious reasons," because it had
"evolutionary overtones" or "would not go well with the Christian
community" or because "the evolution stuff is a problem."
<p>Hyman Field, who as a science foundation official had a role in the financing
of "Volcanoes," said he understood that theaters must be responsive to
their audiences. But Dr. Field he said he was "furious" that a science
museum would decide not to show a scientifically accurate documentary like
"Volcanoes" because it mentioned evolution.
<p>"It's very alarming," he said, "all of this pressure being put
on a lot of the public institutions by the fundamentalists."
<p>People who follow the issue say it is more likely to arise at science centers
and other public institutions than at commercial theaters. The filmmaker James
Cameron, who was a producer on "Volcanoes," said the commercial film
he made on the same topic, "Aliens of the Deep," had not encountered
opposition, except during post-production, when "it was requested from some
theaters that we change a line of dialogue" relating to sun worship by
ancient Egyptians. The line remained, he said.
<p>Mr. Cameron said he was "surprised and somewhat offended" that
people were sensitive to the references to evolution in "Volcanoes."
<p>"It seems to be a new phenomenon," he said, "obviously
symptomatic of our shift away from empiricism in science to faith-based
science."
<p>Some in the industry say they fear that documentary filmmakers will steer
clear of science topics likely to offend religious fundamentalists.
<p>Large-format science documentaries "are generally not big
moneymakers," said Joe DeAmicis, vice president for marketing at the
California Science Center in Los Angeles and formerly the director of its Imax
theater. "It's going to be hard for our filmmakers to continue to make
unfettered documentaries when they know going in that 10 percent of the
market" will reject them.
<p>Others who follow the issue say many institutions are not able to resist such
pressure.
<p>"They have to be extremely careful as to how they present anything
relating to evolution," said Bayley Silleck, who wrote and directed
"Cosmic Voyage." Mr. Silleck said he confronted religious objections
to that film and predicted he would face them again with a project he is working
on now, about dinosaurs.
<p>Of course, a number of factors affect a theater manager's decision about a
movie. Mr. Silleck said an Imax documentary about oil fires in Kuwait
"never reached its distribution potential" because it had shots of the
first Persian Gulf war. "The theaters decided their patrons would be upset
at seeing the bodies," he said.
<p>"We all have to make films for an audience that is a family
audience," he went on, "when you are talking about Imax, because they
are in science centers and museums."
<p>He added, however, "there are a number of us who are concerned that
there is a kind of tacit overcaution, overprotectedness of the audience on the
part of theater operators."
<p>In any event, censoring films like "Volcanoes" is not an option,
said Dr. Field, who said Mr. Low, the film's producer, got in touch with him
when the evolution issue arose to ask whether the film should be altered.
<p>"I said absolutely not," recalled Dr. Field, who retired from the
National Science Foundation last year.
<p>Mr. Low said that arguments over religion and science disturbed him because
of his own religious faith. In his view, he said, science is "a celebration
of what nature or God has done. So for me, there's no conflict."
<p>Dr. Lutz, the Rutgers oceanographer, recalled a showing of
"Volcanoes" he and Mr. Low attended at the New England Aquarium. When
the movie ended, a little girl stood in the audience to challenge Mr. Low on the
film's suggestion that Earth might have formed billions of years ago in the
explosion of a star. "I thought God created the Earth," she said.
<p>He replied, "Maybe that's how God did it."
