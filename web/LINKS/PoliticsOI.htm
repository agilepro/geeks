<h1 align=center>The Politics of Ignorance</h1>
by <a href=http://www.samharris.org>Sam Harris</a>, 08.02.2005<p>

President Bush has now endorsed the pseudo-scientific notion of "intelligent
design" (ID) and declared it to be a legitimate alternative to the theory of
evolution. This is not surprising, as he has always maintained that "the
jury is still out" on the question of evolution. But the jury is not out --
indeed it was well in before President Bush was even born -- and anyone
familiar with modern biology knows that ID is nothing more than a program of
political and religious advocacy masquerading as science.<p>

It is for this reason that the scientific community has been divided on just
how (or whether) to dignify the spurious claims of ID "theorists" with a
response. While understandable, I believe that such scruples are now
misplaced. The Trojan Horse has passed the innermost gates of the city, and
scary religious imbeciles are now spilling out.<p>

According to several recent polls, 22 percent of Americans are certain that
Jesus will return to earth sometime in the next fifty years. Another 22
percent believe that he will probably do so. This is likely the same 44
percent who go to church once a week or more, who believe that God literally
promised the land of Israel to the Jews, and who want to stop teaching our
children about the biological fact of evolution. As the President is well
aware, believers of this sort constitute the most cohesive and motivated
segment of the American electorate. Consequently, their views and prejudices
now influence almost every decision of national importance. Political
liberals seem to have drawn the wrong lesson from these developments and are
now thumbing scripture, wondering how best to ingratiate themselves to the
legions of men and women in our country who vote mainly on the basis of
religious dogma. More than 50 percent of Americans have a "negative" or
"highly negative" view of people who do not believe in God; 70 percent think
it important for presidential candidates to be "strongly religious." Because
it is taboo to criticize a person’s religious beliefs, political debate over
questions of public policy (stem-cell research, the ethics of assisted
suicide and euthanasia, obscenity and free speech, gay marriage, etc.)
generally gets framed in terms appropriate to a theocracy. Unreason is now
ascendant in the United States -- in our schools, in our courts, and in each
branch of the federal government. Only 28 percent of Americans believe in
evolution; 68 percent believe in Satan. Ignorance in this degree,
concentrated in both the head and belly of a lumbering superpower, is now a
problem for the entire world.<p>

It is time that scientists and other public intellectuals observed that the
contest between faith and reason is zero-sum. There is no question but that
nominally religious scientists like Francis Collins and Kenneth R. Miller
are doing lasting harm to our discourse by the accommodations they have made
to religious irrationality. Likewise, Stephen Jay Gould's notion of
"non-overlapping magisteria" served only the religious dogmatists who
realize, quite rightly, that there is only one magisterium. Whether a person
is religious or secular, there is nothing more sacred than the facts. Either
Jesus was born of a virgin, or he wasn't; either there is a God who despises
homosexuals, or there isn't. It is time that sane human beings agreed on the
standards of evidence necessary to substantiate truth-claims of this sort.
The issue is not, as ID advocates allege, whether science can "rule out" the
existence of the biblical God. There are an infinite number of ludicrous
ideas that science could not "rule out," but which no sensible person would
entertain. The issue is whether there is any good reason to believe the
sorts of things that religious dogmatists believe -- that God exists and
takes an interest in the affairs of human beings; that the soul enters the
zygote at the moment of conception (and, therefore, that blastocysts are the
moral equivalents of persons); etc. There simply is no good reason to
believe such things, and scientists should stop hiding their light under a
bushel and make this emphatically obvious to everyone.<p>

Imagine President Bush addressing the National Prayer Breakfast in these
terms: "Behind all of life and all history there is a dedication and a
purpose, set by the hand of a just and faithful Zeus." Imagine his speech to
Congress containing the sentence "Freedom and fear, justice and cruelty have
always been at war, and we know that Apollo is not neutral between them."
Clearly, the commonplaces of language conceal the vacuity and strangeness of
many of our beliefs. Our president regularly speaks in phrases appropriate
to the fourteenth century, and no one seems inclined to find out what words
like "God" and "crusade" and "wonder-working power" mean to him. Not only do
we still eat the offal of the ancient world; we are positively smug about
it. Garry Wills has noted that the Bush White House "is currently
honeycombed with prayer groups and Bible study cells, like a whited
monastery." This should trouble us as much as it troubles the fanatics of
the Muslim world.<p>

The only thing that permits human beings to collaborate with one another in
a truly open-ended way is their willingness to have their beliefs modified
by new facts. Only openness to evidence and argument will secure a common
world for us. Nothing guarantees that reasonable people will agree about
everything, of course, but the unreasonable are certain to be divided by
their dogmas. It is time we recognized that this spirit of mutual inquiry,
which is the foundation of all real science, is the very antithesis of
religious faith.<p>
