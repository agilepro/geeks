<h3> Campaign to Urge Star Jones to "Walk a Mile in Our Shoes" before Judging Us</h3>

<p>In February 2001, the <a href="http://www.fsgp.org/"><font color=#0000FF>
 Anti-Discrimination Support Network (ADSN)</font></a> wrote a
letter to Star Jones, who for the second time in less than a year, had
expressed prejudice against Atheists on the talk show, "The View" (see "ADSN
Decries Star Jones’ Point of View" in the March/April issue of The Greater Philadelphia Story).<p>

Jones never acknowledged ADSN’s demand for an apology. On February 13, 2002,
she made matters worse by making fun of the small number of Atheists who
were concerned about her bigoted views. Jones intimated that Atheists are
unpatriotic, while falsely claiming that our complaint had been in response
to patriotic remarks she made on September 12, 2001. On February 13, 2002,
Jones said that in her opinion Atheists are unqualified to hold the office
of President of the United States.<p>
While Jones is entitled to her opinion, she has a moral duty to present the
facts truthfully. She should also be held accountable for spreading hateful
and negative stereotyping of a minority community. Had Jones made the same
remarks about the Jewish community, the Anti-Defamation League would have
demanded and received a public apology. Atheists must demand and receive the
same type of respect.<p>
A clever attention-getting campaign is in order. Please participate in the
"Star Jones, Walk A Mile In My Shoes!" campaign. Please see the details in
the form below. When you send the form to Jones, please send it with a pair
of used shoes. This will help make our point. Jones is a national
spokesperson for Payless ShoeSource so the inclusion of a pair of shoes is
very appropriate.<p>
Participants in this campaign must not belittle the religious beliefs of
Jones or any other religious belief. She, like all Americans, can believe
anything she likes. We are only objecting to her bigotry, not her belief in
a supernatural God. Please keep this in mind when you write to her. The
following mailing labels are provided for your convenience:

<h4>Example Letter</h4>
<h5>Star Jones, Walk A Mile In My Shoes!</h5>

<p>I am an Atheist who is offended by the demeaning remarks you have been
recorded as having said on January 22. 2001 and February 13, 2002 during the
airing of "The View." While I support freedom of speech, I strongly object
to media personalities spreading hateful rhetoric, negative stereotyping,
and disrespectful treatment of a minority.<p>
In February 2001, <a href = "http://www.fsgp.org">
<font color=#0000FF>the Anti-Discrimination Support Network (ADSN)</font></a>
- a national
organization that represents the interests of the Atheist community)
requested a public apology from you. You have not had the courtesy to
respond. I am, therefore, asking you to educate yourself on what it is like
to be a mistreated minority in America.<p>
Attached or on the reverse side of this form is my personal story of the
type of discrimination I have suffered at the hands of bigoted people such
as yourself. Please take the time to read my correspondence.<p>
As a spokesperson for Payless Shoes and a talk show host, you should know
what it is like to walk a mile in the shoes of a misunderstood minority. You
may find that my words will open your heart and make you more compassionate
and sensitive, qualities that all media personalities should possess.
Acknowledgment is expected.

<p>My name is: ___________________________________________________________
<p>My street address is: _____________________________________________________
<p>My city, state, and zip code are:_____________________________________________
<p>Signed: ______________________________________________________________
<p>A copy of this form and my personal story are being sent to Payless
ShoeSource and ADSN.<p><br>
