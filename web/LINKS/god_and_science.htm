<h1>Scientists Speak Up on Mix of God and Science</h1>

<p>At a recent scientific conference at City College of New York, a student in
the audience rose to ask the panelists an unexpected question: "Can you
be a good scientist and believe in God?"
<p>Reaction from one of the panelists, all Nobel laureates, was quick and sharp.
"No!" declared Herbert A. Hauptman, who shared the chemistry prize in
1985 for his work on the structure of crystals.
<p>Belief in the supernatural, especially belief in God, is not only
incompatible with good science, Dr. Hauptman declared, "this kind of belief
is damaging to the well-being of the human race."
<p>But disdain for religion is far from universal among scientists. And today,
as religious groups challenge scientists in arenas as various as evolution in
the classroom, AIDS prevention and stem cell research, scientists who embrace
religion are beginning to speak out about their faith.
<p>"It should not be a taboo subject, but frankly it often is in scientific
circles," said Francis S. Collins, who directs the National Human Genome
Research Institute and who speaks freely about his Christian faith.
<p>Although they embrace religious faith, these scientists also embrace science
as it has been defined for centuries. That is, they look to the natural world
for explanations of what happens in the natural world and they recognize that
scientific ideas must be provisional - capable of being overturned by evidence
from experimentation and observation. This belief in science sets them apart
from those who endorse creationism or its doctrinal cousin, intelligent design,
both of which depend on the existence of a supernatural force.
<p>Their belief in God challenges scientists who regard religious belief as
little more than magical thinking, as some do. Their faith also challenges
believers who denounce science as a godless enterprise and scientists as secular
elitists contemptuous of God-fearing people.
<p>Some scientists say simply that science and religion are two separate realms,
"nonoverlapping magisteria," as the late evolutionary biologist
Stephen Jay Gould put it in his book "Rocks of Ages" (Ballantine,
1999). In Dr. Gould's view, science speaks with authority in the realm of
"what the universe is made of (fact) and why does it work this way
(theory)" and religion holds sway over "questions of ultimate meaning
and moral value."
<p>When the American Association for the Advancement of Science devoted a
session to this idea of separation at its annual meeting this year, scores of
scientists crowded into a room to hear it.
<p>Some of them said they were unsatisfied with the idea, because they believe
scientists' moral values must inevitably affect their work, others because so
much of science has so many ethical implications in the real world.
<p>One panelist, Dr. Noah Efron of Bar-Ilan University in Israel, said
scientists, like other people, were guided by their own human purposes, meaning
and values. The idea that fact can be separated from values and meaning
"jibes poorly with what we know of the history of science," Dr. Efron
said.
<p>Dr. Collins, who is working on a book about his religious faith, also
believes that people should not have to keep religious beliefs and scientific
theories strictly separate. "I don't find it very satisfactory and I don't
find it very necessary," he said in an interview. He noted that until
relatively recently, most scientists were believers. "Isaac Newton wrote a
lot more about the Bible than the laws of nature," he said.
<p>But he acknowledged that as head of the American government's efforts to
decipher the human genetic code, he had a leading role in work that many say
definitively demonstrates the strength of evolutionary theory to explain the
complexity and abundance of life.
<p>As scientists compare human genes with those of other mammals, tiny worms,
even bacteria, the similarities "are absolutely compelling," Dr.
Collins said. "If Darwin had tried to imagine a way to prove his theory, he
could not have come up with something better, except maybe a time machine.
Asking somebody to reject all of that in order to prove that they really do love
God - what a horrible choice."
<p>Dr. Collins was a nonbeliever until he was 27 - "more and more into the
mode of being not only agnostic but being an atheist," as he put it. All
that changed after he completed his doctorate in physics and was at work on his
medical degree, when he was among those treating a woman dying of heart disease.
"She was very clear about her faith and she looked me square in the eye and
she said, 'what do you believe?' " he recalled. "I sort of stammered
out, 'I am not sure.' "
<p>He said he realized then that he had never considered the matter seriously,
the way a scientist should. He began reading about various religious beliefs,
which only confused him. Finally, a Methodist minister gave him a book,
"Mere Christianity," by C. S. Lewis. In the book Lewis, an atheist
until he was a grown man, argues that the idea of right and wrong is universal
among people, a moral law they "did not make, and cannot quite forget even
when they try." This universal feeling, he said, is evidence for the
plausibility of God.
<p>When he read the book, Dr. Collins said, "I thought, my gosh, this guy
is me."
<p>Today, Dr. Collins said, he does not embrace any particular denomination, but
he is a Christian. Colleagues sometimes express surprise at his faith, he said.
"They'll say, 'how can you believe that? Did you check your brain at the
door?" But he said he had discovered in talking to students and colleagues
that "there is a great deal of interest in this topic."
<p><strong>Polling Scientists on Beliefs</strong>
<p>According to a much-discussed survey reported in the journal Nature in 1997,
40 percent of biologists, physicists and mathematicians said they believed in
God - and not just a nonspecific transcendental presence but, as the survey put
it, a God to whom one may pray "in expectation of receiving an
answer."
<p>The survey, by Edward J. Larson of the University of Georgia, was intended to
replicate one conducted in 1914, and the results were virtually unchanged. In
both cases, participants were drawn from a directory of American scientists.
<p>Others play down those results. They note that when Dr. Larson put part of
the same survey to "leading scientists" - in this case, members of the
National Academy of Sciences, perhaps the nation's most eminent scientific
organization - fewer than 10 percent professed belief in a personal God or human
immortality.
<p>This response is not surprising to researchers like Steven Weinberg, a
physicist at the University of Texas, a member of the academy and a winner of
the Nobel Prize in 1979 for his work in particle physics. He said he could
understand why religious people would believe that anything that eroded belief
was destructive. But he added: "I think one of the great historical
contributions of science is to weaken the hold of religion. That's a good
thing."
<p><strong>No God, No Moral Compass?</strong>
<p>He rejects the idea that scientists who reject religion are arrogant.
"We know how many mistakes we've made," Dr. Weinberg said. And he is
angered by assertions that people without religious faith are without a moral
compass.
<p>In any event, he added, "the experience of being a scientist makes
religion seem fairly irrelevant," he said. "Most scientists I know
simply don't think about it very much. They don't think about religion enough to
qualify as practicing atheists."
<p>Most scientists he knows who do believe in God, he added, believe in "a
God who is behind the laws of nature but who is not intervening."
<p>Kenneth R. Miller, a biology professor at Brown, said his students were often
surprised to find that he was religious, especially when they realized that his
faith was not some sort of vague theism but observant Roman Catholicism.
<p>Dr. Miller, whose book, "Finding Darwin's God," explains his
reconciliation of the theory of evolution with his religious faith, said he was
usually challenged in his biology classes by one or two students whose religions
did not accept evolution, who asked how important the theory would be in the
course.
<p>"What they are really asking me is "do I have to believe in this
stuff to get an A?,' " he said. He says he tells them that "belief is
never an issue in science."
<p>"I don't care if you believe in the Krebs cycle," he said,
referring to the process by which energy is utilized in the cell. "I just
want you to know what it is and how it works. My feeling about evolution is the
same thing."
<p>For Dr. Miller and other scientists, research is not about belief.
"Faith is one thing, what you believe from the heart," said Joseph E.
Murray, who won the Nobel Prize in medicine in 1990 for his work in organ
transplantation. But in scientific research, he said, "it's the results
that count."
<p>Dr. Murray, who describes himself as "a cradle Catholic" who has
rarely missed weekly Mass and who prays every morning, said that when he was
preparing for the first ever human organ transplant, a kidney that a young man
had donated to his identical twin, he and his colleagues consulted a number of
religious leaders about whether they were doing the right thing. "It seemed
natural," he said.
<p><strong>Using Every Tool</strong>
<p>"When you are searching for truth you should use every possible avenue,
including revelation," said Dr. Murray, who is a member of the Pontifical
Academy, which advises the Vatican on scientific issues, and who described the
influence of his faith on his work in his memoir, "Surgery of the
Soul" (Science History Publications, 2002).
<p>Since his appearance at the City College panel, when he was dismayed by the
tepid reception received by his remarks on the incompatibility of good science
and religious belief, Dr. Hauptman said he had been discussing the issue with
colleagues in Buffalo, where he is president of the Hauptman-Woodward Medical
Research Institute.
<p>"I think almost without exception the people I have spoken to are
scientists and they do believe in the existence of a supreme being," he
said. "If you ask me to explain it - I cannot explain it at all."
<p>But Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary theorist at Oxford, said that even
scientists who were believers did not claim evidence for that belief. "The
most they will claim is that there is no evidence against," Dr. Dawkins
said, "which is pathetically weak. There is no evidence against all sorts
of things, but we don't waste our time believing in them."
<p>Dr. Collins said he believed that some scientists were unwilling to profess
faith in public "because the assumption is if you are a scientist you don't
have any need of action of the supernatural sort," or because of pride in
the idea that science is the ultimate source of intellectual meaning.
<p>But he said he believed that some scientists were simply unwilling to
confront the big questions religion tried to answer. "You will never
understand what it means to be a human being through naturalistic
observation," he said. "You won't understand why you are here and what
the meaning is. Science has no power to address these questions - and are they
not the most important questions we ask ourselves?"
