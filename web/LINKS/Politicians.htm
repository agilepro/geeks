<h2 align=center>Politicians Must Declare Religious Interests, Say Secularists</h2>
Politicians who are affiliated to religious bodies
should declare on their nomination forms whether they
will be primarily serving their religious beliefs or
the interests of their constituents, says the National
Secular Society. The call comes in a letter to the
Electoral Commission, a government body that oversees
the electoral process.<p>
The NSS’s concern has been prompted by the publication
by the Vatican of a document ("Doctrinal Note on Some
Questions Regarding the Participation of Catholics in
Political Life") calling for Catholic politicians to
unquestioningly support Catholic doctrine.<p>
The document cites abortion, euthanasia and gay
marriage as particular as "non-negotiable" issues that
Catholic politicians have a "duty" to oppose. Related
issues are thought to include stem cell and embryo
research. The guidelines make reference to concerns
about "scientific progress" and also cite: "the
emergence of ambiguities or questionable positions in
recent times." The 17-page leaflet is approved by the
Pope and signed by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the head
of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith
(previously known as the Inquisition).<p>
Keith Porteous Wood, Executive Director of the
National Secular Society, said: "This document is
profoundly anti-democratic. Politicians have been
elected to serve the interests of their constituents,
not those of the Vatican. In Britain, and most of the
rest of Europe, the vast majority of the population
does not support the Catholic line on abortion,
euthanasia, contraception and a host of other issues.
It is an abuse of democracy for the Vatican to seek to
control Catholic politicians like puppets in order to
have its doctrines imposed through law or enforced in
the actions and policies of public bodies."<p>
Mr Wood said that what the Pope was doing smacked of
totalitarianism. "To say that contentious issues are
non-negotiable in a free society is unacceptable and
repressive."<p>
In the letter to the Electoral Commission, the NSS
asks that politicians be required to declare any
religious interests on their nomination form, and to
state whether they intend to promote these interests
over and above the needs and wants of the electorate.<p>
Keith Porteous Wood added: "The electorate should know
where their candidates stand. If a politician’s
actions are going to be dictated by the Vatican – or
any other religious body - then this needs to be
clearly stated before an election. Were this to be
required, it would be less easy for politicians to
attain power under false pretences and then act
against the desires of the people who gave them that
power, unaware of their true allegiances."
