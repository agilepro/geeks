<h3 align=center>Islamic Theologian's Theory: It's Likely the Prophet Muhammad Never Existed</h3>
By ANDREW HIGGINS<p>November 15, 2008<p>
MÜNSTER, Germany — Muhammad Sven Kalisch, a Muslim
convert and Germany's first professor of Islamic
theology, fasts during the Muslim holy month, doesn't
like to shake hands with Muslim women and has spent
years studying Islamic scripture. Islam, he says, guides
his life.
<p>So it came as something of a surprise when Prof.
Kalisch announced the fruit of his theological research.
His conclusion: The Prophet Muhammad probably never
existed.
<p>Muslims, not surprisingly, are outraged. Even Danish
cartoonists who triggered global protests a couple of
years ago didn't portray the Prophet as fictional.
German police, worried about a violent backlash, told
the professor to move his religious-studies center to
more-secure premises.
<p>"We had no idea he would have ideas like this," says
Thomas Bauer, a fellow academic at Münster University
who sat on a committee that appointed Prof. Kalisch.
"I'm a more orthodox Muslim than he is, and I'm not a
Muslim."
<p>When Prof. Kalisch took up his theology chair four
years ago, he was seen as proof that modern Western
scholarship and Islamic ways can mingle — and counter
the influence of radical preachers in Germany. He was
put in charge of a new program at Münster, one of
Germany's oldest and most respected universities, to
train teachers in state schools to teach Muslim pupils
about their faith.
<p>Muslim leaders cheered and joined an advisory board
at his Center for Religious Studies. Politicians hailed
the appointment as a sign of Germany's readiness to
absorb some three million Muslims into mainstream
society. But, says Andreas Pinkwart, a minister
responsible for higher education in this north German
region, "the results are disappointing."
<p>Prof. Kalisch, who insists he's still a Muslim, says
he knew he would get in trouble but wanted to subject
Islam to the same scrutiny as Christianity and Judaism.
German scholars of the 19th century, he notes, were
among the first to raise questions about the historical
accuracy of the Bible.
<p>Many scholars of Islam question the accuracy of
ancient sources on Muhammad's life. The earliest
biography, of which no copies survive, dated from
roughly a century after the generally accepted year of
his death, 632, and is known only by references to it in
much later texts. But only a few scholars have doubted
Muhammad's existence. Most say his life is better
documented than that of Jesus.<p>

<p>"Of course Muhammad existed," says Tilman Nagel, a
scholar in Göttingen and author of a new book,
"Muhammad: Life and Legend." The Prophet differed from
the flawless figure of Islamic tradition, Prof. Nagel
says, but "it is quite astonishing to say that thousands
and thousands of pages about him were all forged" and
there was no such person.
<p>All the same, Prof. Nagel has signed a petition in
support of Prof. Kalisch, who has faced blistering
criticism from Muslim groups and some secular German
academics. "We are in Europe," Prof. Nagel says.
"Education is about thinking, not just learning by
heart."
<p>Prof. Kalisch's religious studies center recently
removed a sign and erased its address from its Web site.
The professor, a burly 42-year-old, says he has received
no specific threats but has been denounced as apostate,
a capital offense in some readings of Islam.
<p>"Maybe people are speculating that some idiot will
come and cut off my head," he said during an interview
in his study.
<p>A few minutes later, an assistant arrived in a panic
to say a suspicious-looking digital clock had been found
lying in the hallway. Police, called to the scene,
declared the clock harmless.
<p>A convert to Islam at age 15, Prof. Kalisch says he
was drawn to the faith because it seemed more rational
than others. He embraced a branch of Shiite Islam noted
for its skeptical bent. After working briefly as a
lawyer, he began work in 2001 on a postdoctoral thesis
in Islamic law in Hamburg, to go through the elaborate
process required to become a professor in Germany.
<p>The Sept. 11 attacks in the U.S. that year appalled
Mr. Kalisch but didn't dent his devotion. Indeed, after
he arrived at Münster University in 2004, he struck some
as too conservative. Sami Alrabaa, a scholar at a nearby
college, recalls attending a lecture by Prof. Kalisch
and being upset by his doctrinaire defense of Islamic
law, known as Sharia.
<p>In private, he was moving in a different direction.
He devoured works questioning the existence of Abraham,
Moses and Jesus. Then "I said to myself: You've dealt
with Christianity and Judaism but what about your own
religion? Can you take it for granted that Muhammad
existed?"
<p>He had no doubts at first, but slowly they emerged.
He was struck, he says, by the fact that the first coins
bearing Muhammad's name did not appear until the late
7th century — six decades after the religion did.
<p>He traded ideas with some scholars in Saarbrücken who
in recent years have been pushing the idea of Muhammad's
nonexistence. They claim that "Muhammad" wasn't the name
of a person but a title, and that Islam began as a
Christian heresy.
<p>Prof. Kalisch didn't buy all of this. Contributing
last year to a book on Islam, he weighed the odds and
called Muhammad's existence "more probable than not." By
early this year, though, his thinking had shifted. "The
more I read, the historical person at the root of the
whole thing became more and more improbable," he says.
<p>He has doubts, too, about the Quran. "God doesn't
write books," Prof. Kalisch says.
<p>Some of his students voiced alarm at the direction of
his teaching. "I began to wonder if he would one day say
he doesn't exist himself," says one. A few boycotted his
lectures. Others sang his praises.
<p>Prof. Kalisch says he "never told students 'just
believe what Kalisch thinks'&nbsp;" but seeks to teach them
to think independently. Religions, he says, are
"crutches" that help believers get to "the spiritual
truth behind them." To him, what matters isn't whether
Muhammad actually lived but the philosophy presented in
his name.
<p>This summer, the dispute hit the headlines. A
Turkish-language German newspaper reported on it with
gusto. Media in the Muslim world picked up on it.
<p>Germany's Muslim Coordinating Council withdrew from
the advisory board of Prof. Kalisch's center. Some
Council members refused to address him by his adopted
Muslim name, Muhammad, saying that he should now be
known as Sven.
<p>German academics split. Michael Marx, a Quran scholar
at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences, warned
that Prof. Kalisch's views would discredit German
scholarship and make it difficult for German scholars to
work in Muslim lands. But Ursula Spuler-Stegemann, an
Islamic studies scholar at the University of Marburg,
set up a Web site called solidaritymuhammadkalisch.com
and started an online petition of support.
<p>Alarmed that a pioneering effort at Muslim outreach
was only stoking antagonism, Münster University decided
to douse the flames. Prof. Kalisch was told he could
keep his professorship but must stop teaching Islam to
future school teachers.
<p>The professor says he's more determined than ever to
keep probing his faith. He is finishing a book to
explain his thoughts. It's in English instead of German
because he wants to make a bigger impact. "I'm convinced
that what I'm doing is necessary. There must be a free
discussion of Islam," he says.<p>
