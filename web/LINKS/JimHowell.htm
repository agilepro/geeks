The article on "Intelligent Design" mentions two problems with
intelligent design -- it's untestable, and one would think that an
intelligent designer would have done a much better job -- but it leaves out
one important concept.<p>
Even if one could totally disprove evolution, that does not provide any
support whatsoever for the Genesis creation account (or any other creation
story).<p>
Proponents of "intelligent design" generally act as if evolution and
Genesis are the only two choices, apparently hoping no one will notice this
"hidden" assumption of theirs.<p>
