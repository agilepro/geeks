<h2>Genetic Mutations Offer Insights on Human Diversity</h2>
By David Brown<br>Washington Post Staff Writer<br>February 22, 2008
<p>We're all pretty much the same except, of course, for the little
things that make us different.
<p>Those are the conclusions of three studies published this week that
looked at human diversity through the keyhole of the genetic mutations
we all carry.
<p>The findings - the latest dividend from the world's investment in
the Human Genome Project in the 1990s - confirm a broad narrative of
human history known from previous biological, archaeological and
linguistic studies. But the new research adds an astonishing level of
detail and a few new insights that were not previously available.
<p>All three studies support the idea that modern human beings left
East Africa, walked into
Central Asia and then fanned out east and west to people the entire
planet. The studies also confirm earlier research showing that as a
group, Africans have more diverse genes than people of other continents.
But the new research further shows that genetic diversity declines
steadily the farther one's ancestors traveled from
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, which is roughly the site of the exit turnstile for the
Africa migration.
<p>The studies also show that many seemingly "purebred" ethnic groups
have ancestry traceable to more than one continent.
<p>For example, the
Arabian Peninsula's Bedouin -- a culturally distinct group -- are
descended not only from longtime Middle Eastern peoples, but also from
Europeans and peoples originating from around modern
Pakistan. The Yakut people of eastern
Siberia share blood with East Asians, Europeans and American
Indians, but very little with Central Asians, who are geographically
closer to them than two of those populations.
<p>The research may also shed light on the genetic underpinnings of
human disease. One study found that Americans of European descent carry
a larger number of damaging gene variants than African Americans do -- a
byproduct of Caucasians' arduous march westward to the shores of the
Atlantic.
<p>The biggest message, though, is that these differences are the
details, not the main message, of human diversity.
<p>About 90 percent of the full catalogue of human genetic diversity
exists in every human population. Individuals are likely to have almost
as many differences with people we consider to be "like us" as with
strangers on the other side of the world.
<p>"What this says is that we are all extremely related to each other,"
said Richard M. Myers, a geneticist at
Stanford University School of Medicine, who helped lead one of the
studies being published today in the journal Science.
<p>"Most genetic variation is shared worldwide. It is only a small part
of human genetic variation that is private to particular continents,"
said Noah A. Rosenberg, of the
University of Michigan. His group's findings were published
yesterday in the journal Nature.
<p>All three studies examined single "letter" changes in the
3-billion-letter transcript that makes up each person's genome. Every
individual carries tens of thousands of these variations. Some do not
change the "words" that are the genes; some change a word but not its
meaning; and some change the meaning in a way that can be beneficial or
harmful.
<p>Each person's collection of these changes (called "single nucleotide
polymorphisms, or SNPs) contributes to his or her individuality. People
with a common ancestry, however, tend to have similar collections of
SNPs (pronounced "snips").
<p>"There is no single gene, no single DNA marker, that would
distinguish one population from another," Myers said. Instead, he said,
"it is a pattern, like a bar code with thousands of lines on it," that
allows researchers to tease apart the fine points of relatedness among
populations.
<p>He and his colleagues looked at 938 individuals from 51 different
populations whose DNA is in a repository in
France. The group lead by Rosenberg and Andrew B. Singleton, of the
University of Virginia, studied 485 people from the same collection.
Each person studied had a clear-cut ethnic identity and in most cases
came from a family that had lived in the group's homeland for
generations.
<p>With such diverse and abundant starting material, the researchers
were able to sketch a picture of ethnicity far more detailed than
previously known.
<p>For example, Africa's surviving hunter-gatherers -- two groups of
pygmies and the San people of southern Africa who were formerly known as
Bushmen -- are closely related to one another and quite distinct on a
genetic basis from all other black Africans. The Hazara of
<a target href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/countries/afghanistan.html?nav=el">
Afghanistan</a> and Pakistan and the Uygur of northwestern
<a target href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/countries/china.html?nav=el">
China</a> are also close genetic relatives, despite living far apart. On
the other hand, China's dominant ethnicity, the Han, is actually two
genetically distinct groups, the northern and the southern Han.
<p>The research shows that populations' genetic footprints on the planet
are deep, sharp and not easily covered over by time.
<p>Both research teams using the French DNA collection found geographic
distance from East Africa is a major determinant of genetic differences
among groups.
<p>"Each group carried only a subset of the genetic variation from its
ancestral population. So there is a loss of genetic diversity with the
distance from Africa," Rosenberg said.
<p>One of the more interesting consequences of that pattern is the
subject of the third study, also published in Nature.
<p>Carlos D. Bustamante of
Cornell University and his colleagues measured SNPs in 20 European
Americans and 15 African Americans. They found that the average person
carries at least 2,000 SNPs that change the meaning of a genetic "word."
However, in the European Americans, a larger proportion of those changes
were likely to be unhealthy or unfavorable.
<p>The reasons for this curious finding are not fully known, although
there are theories.
<p>The chief explanation is that the ancestors of Europeans (and most
white Americans) suffered repeated population "bottlenecks" in which
their numbers crashed as result of epidemics, environmental catastrophes
and genocide. Each time that happened, the population lost a lot of its
genetic diversity simply because a lot of people died.
<p>The survivors, like their ancestors, carried a certain random
collection of deleterious SNPs -- genes that caused disease or increased
the risk of disease. When the population rebounded, those genes were
spread widely as the small number of survivors gave rise to all living
descendants.
<p>But if they were potentially bad, why weren't they flushed out by
natural selection? That is the mystery.
<p>It may be that in the rebound after the bottleneck, the slight
hazardousness of these SNPs did not make much difference. New
conditions, perhaps territory free of competitors or a new technology
for getting food, allowed people who carried them to flourish just as
well as people who did not have them.
<p>It is even possible that some deleterious SNPs were "dragged along"
into the future because they were physically close on chromosomes to
newly arising SNPs that increased a person's biological fitness.
<p>With time, natural selection will tend to flush the deleterious SNPs
out, as it has done -- relatively speaking -- in African populations.
But in the case of Europeans, not enough time has passed.
