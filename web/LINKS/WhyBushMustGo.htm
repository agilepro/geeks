 In our great democracy, elections come and go. Some are more exciting than
 others. Some are more important than others.
 <p class="textBodyBlack">But make no mistake about this one. The presidential
 election of 2004 is the most important of our lifetime. Never before has there
 been such a dangerous man in the White House. Never before has it been so
 vital, for the good of the Republic and everything we stand for as Americans,
 to oust an incumbent president from office.</p>
 <p class="textBodyBlack">Before Tom DeLay lumps me among the
 “Bush-haters,” I want to make one thing perfectly clear: I do not hate
 George W. Bush. It’s nothing personal. I just think he’s a sad, sorry
 excuse for a president. His policies have ruined the economy, pitted Americans
 against each other, destroyed the environment and made enemies around the
 world.</p>
 <p class="textBodyBlack">Despite losing the 2000 popular vote to Al Gore,
 George Bush did not walk lightly into the Oval Office. His administration
 brought more than a change of presidents and cabinet secretaries. He acted as
 if he had a mandate. Both at home and abroad, he has steered this nation in
 radical and dangerous new directions. He has betrayed our trust. He has
 adopted policies that are antithetical to our core national values.</p>
 <p class="textBodyBlack">On the international scene, Bush promised a
 “humble” foreign policy. Instead, he has delivered the most arrogant brand
 of foreign relations possible. He abandoned the idea of “containment,”
 successfully followed for four decades by Republican and Democratic presidents
 alike - against such enemies as the Soviet Union, Communist China and Cuba –
 and replaced it with his new policy of “first strike” or “anticipatory
 self-defense” – the same argument used by the Japanese Empire to justify
 its strike on Pearl Harbor. Under the new Bush doctrine, the United States
 asserts the right to go anywhere, anytime and overthrow any government we
 think may someday pose a threat.</p>
 <p class="textBodyBlack">Iraq was Bush’s first pre-emptive war. Today, over
 a year later, it is still a war in search of a reason. As it turns out,
 everything George Bush told the American people to justify going to war in
 Iraq was a lie. We’ve found no weapons of mass destruction, no nuclear
 weapons, no long-range missiles, no bomb-carrying drones, no connection to
 September 11, no links to Osama bin Laden and no imminent threat to the United
 States. None of Bush’s reasons for unilaterally starting a war that has
 claimed over 500 American lives proved to be true. The war in Iraq was both
 unnecessary and unwise.</p>
 <p class="textBodyBlack">Bush also reversed course on decades of international
 cooperation – much of it wisely championed by his father - on global issues.
 Flying the flag of neo-isolationism, Bush cancelled U.S. participation in
 existing treaties on the law of the sea, biological weapons and missile
 defense, pulled the plug on a new treaty on global warming and thumbed his
 nose at the United Nations.</p>
 <p class="textBodyBlack">As a result, respect for the United States and for
 our president has deteriorated around the world. Bush is ridiculed as the
 “Toxic Texan.” Even among our allies, most people now regard America as an
 unfriendly and belligerent power. The United States could only round up two
 other countries, Great Britain and Australia, to join in the invasion of Iraq
 – and then on a very small scale.</p>
 <p class="textBodyBlack">On the home front, Bush has wreaked even more havoc.
 He took the country’s economy from A-OK to IOU, turning a projected, 10-year
 $5 billion surplus into a projected $5 billion deficit and, in the short term,
 replacing Bill Clinton’s balanced budget with a 2004 budget deficit of $374
 billion, the largest in history. According to projections issued by the White
 House Budget Office in January 2004, Bush will set an all-time new deficit
 record of $520 billion in 2005. At the same time, Bush rewarded his favorite
 constituency, those Americans making over $320,000 a year, with two
 back-to-back tax cuts that they didn’t need and we couldn’t afford.</p>
 <p class="textBodyBlack">Bush also wrecked the economy. Eight years of the
 most robust economic growth in history have been followed by three years of
 Bush recession and the loss of 2.8 million private sector jobs. After 10
 quarters of decline or stagnation, the economy may be finally starting to
 rebound. But, even so, it’s a jobless recovery. Nine million Americans are
 still out of work. George Bush will be the first president since Herbert
 Hoover to leave office with more Americans out of work than when he arrived.</p>
 <p class="textBodyBlack">The Bush recession hurt all Americans - except those
 special interests who fueled his election campaign with big contributions. To
 them, he handed a whole grab-bag of federal goodies: giant new subsidies to
 big agricultural firms; freedom to continue polluting to refineries and
 utilities; access to national monuments and forests to timber and mining
 interests; and drilling in Alaska and national parks to oil companies. George
 Bush paid his friends back, big-time.</p>
 <p class="textBodyBlack">At the same time, he declared war on all the rest of
 us. George Bush cut funds for student loans and Head Start. He stuck seniors
 with a prescription drug plan that charges seniors more for less. He built up
 a bigger, bloated federal government. He caused irreparable damage to the
 environment. And he unleashed Attorney General John Ashcroft in a direct
 assault on our civil liberties under the so-called “USA Patriot Act.”</p>
 <p class="textBodyBlack">Bush and Ashcroft have violated the due process of
 law by locking up suspects for months with no access to a lawyer and no chance
 to prove their innocence. They have also trampled on the Fourth Amendment by
 requiring law-abiding citizens to open up their bank, medical, credit card,
 telephone and computer records to the FBI. It’s all part of the war on
 terror, they argue. Yet George Bush’s so-called war on terror is mostly pure
 public relations. He has actually left us more vulnerable to terrorism, not
 less.</p>
 <p class="textBodyBlack">To be fair, Bush has done a few good things. He
 stepped up to the plate after September 11 and demonstrated strong leadership.
 He led a successful campaign against al Qaeda in Afghanistan. He refused to
 brand Islam as a violent religion, or all Muslims as terrorists. He proposed a
 temporary work permit for undocumented workers from Mexico.</p>
 <p class="textBodyBlack">That’s it. Trying to be as generous as I can, those
 are the only four positive things I can think of. And they are completely
 overshadowed by all the evil he has done.</p>
 <p class="textBodyBlack">On November 6, 2000 – the day before he lost the
 popular vote to Al Gore – George Bush told a crowd in Bentonville, Arkansas:
 “They misunderestimated me.” We sure did. He turned out to be a far worse
 president than we had ever feared. That’s why this election is so critical.</p>
 <p class="textBodyBlack">Anyone who follows American politics knows: Whenever
 a president is running for re-election, the election is more about him than
 his opponent. That’s certainly true this year.</p>
 <p class="textBodyBlack">The election of 2004 is not about whether you like
 George Bush better than John Kerry. The election of 2004 is about one thing
 only: It is a referendum on George Bush’s record. It is a referendum on the
 disastrous policies of George W. Bush. It is our only chance to get rid of him
 before he can do any more damage – to our nation, to our environment, and to
 our children’s future.</p>
 <p class="textBodyBlack">Two friends of mine took a trip around the world in
 2003. They returned inspired by the beautiful sites they had visited, but
 disheartened at the anti-Americanism they encountered everywhere they
 traveled. I wanted to know, do they blame us or do they blame George Bush? For
 now, they reported, they only blame George Bush - because they know we
 didn’t really elect him in 2000. But if we re-elect him in 2004, they
 warned, then they will start to blame us. We can’t let that happen.</p>
 <p class="textBodyBlack">I admit, it was tough, writing this book. There are a
 thousand reasons why George Bush doesn’t deserve a second term, and didn’t
 deserve a first one. But, to save time and trees, I had to limit my list to
 the TOP TEN – and that was hard.</p>
 <p class="textBodyBlack">So, I need your help. Let’s make this a cooperative
 project. You, no doubt, have your own reasons for dumping this guy. At any
 time, I invite you to turn to the back of this book and use the space provided
 for listing “MY OWN REASONS FOR GETTING RID OF GEORGE BUSH.” Or check out
 my website at Billpress.com – and sound off. But, please, join the team:
 Read my Top Ten Reasons, add your own, share them with your friends and
 neighbors, and then - Run to the ballot box and send this president back to
 Texas.
