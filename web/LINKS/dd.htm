<br>
_The
Devil's Dictionary_ was begun in a weekly paper in 1881, and was <br>
continued
in a desultory way at long intervals until 1906.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>In that <br>
year a large part of it was published in covers
with the title _The <br>
Cynic's Word Book_, a name which the author had not
the power to <br>
reject or happiness to approve.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>To quote the publishers of the <br>
present work:<br>
<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">    </span>&quot;This more reverent title had
previously been forced upon him by <br>
the religious scruples of the last
newspaper in which a part of the <br>
work had appeared, with the natural
consequence that when it came out <br>
in covers the country already had been
flooded by its imitators with a <br>
score of 'cynic' books -- _The Cynic's
This_, _The Cynic's That_, and <br>
_The Cynic's t'Other_.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Most of these books were merely stupid,
though <br>
some of them added the distinction of silliness.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Among them, they <br>
brought the word
'cynic' into disfavor so deep that any book bearing <br>
it was discredited in
advance of publication.&quot;<br>
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   
</span>Meantime, too, some of the enterprising humorists of the country <br>
had
helped themselves to such parts of the work as served their needs, <br>
and
many of its definitions, anecdotes, phrases and so forth, had <br>
become more
or less current in popular speech.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This
explanation is <br>
made, not with any pride of priority in trifles, but in
simple denial <br>
of possible charges of plagiarism, which is no trifle.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In merely <br>
resuming his own the author
hopes to be held guiltless by those to <br>
whom the work is addressed --
enlightened souls who prefer dry wines <br>
to sweet, sense to sentiment, wit
to humor and clean English to slang.<br>
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   
</span>A conspicuous, and it is hope not unpleasant, feature of the book <br>
is
its abundant illustrative quotations from eminent poets, chief of <br>
whom is
that learned and ingenius cleric, Father Gassalasca Jape, <br>
S.J., whose
lines bear his initials.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To Father
Jape's kindly <br>
encouragement and assistance the author of the prose text
is greatly <br>
indebted.<br>

ABASEMENT,
n.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A decent and customary mental
attitude in the presence <br>

ABDICATION, n.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

ABDOMEN, n.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
temple of the god Stomach, in whose worship, with <br>
sacrificial rights, all
true men engage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>From women this
ancient <br>
faith commands but a stammering assent.<span style="mso-spacerun:

the altar in a half-hearted and
ineffective way, but true reverence <br>
for the one deity that men really
adore they know not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If woman had a
<br>
free hand in the world's marketing the race would become <br>
graminivorous.<br>

ABILITY,
n.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The natural equipment to accomplish
some small part of <br>
the meaner ambitions distinguishing able men from dead
ones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the <br>
last analysis
ability is commonly found to consist mainly in a high <br>
degree of
solemnity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Perhaps, however, this
impressive quality is <br>
rightly appraised; it is no easy task to be
solemn.<br>
<br>
ABNORMAL, adj.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Not
conforming to standard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In matters of
thought and <br>
conduct, to be independent is to be abnormal, to be abnormal
is to be <br>
detested.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Wherefore the
lexicographer adviseth a striving toward the <br>
straiter [sic] resemblance
of the Average Man than he hath to himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

</span>Since a detachment of Dullards came <br>
over with the Pilgrims in the

FLY-SPECK, n.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The prototype of punctuation.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is observed by <br>
Garvinus that the
systems of punctuation in use by the various <br>
literary nations depended
originally upon the social habits and <br>
general diet of the flies infesting
the several countries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These <br>
creatures,
which have always been distinguished for a neighborly and <br>
companionable
familiarity with authors, liberally or niggardly <br>
embellish the
manuscripts in process of growth under the pen, <br>
according to their bodily
habit, bringing out the sense of the work by <br>
a species of interpretation
superior to, and independent of, the <br>
writer's powers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The &quot;old masters&quot; of literature --
that is to say, <br>
the early writers whose work is so esteemed by later
scribes and <br>
critics in the same language -- never punctuated at all, but
worked <br>
right along free-handed, without that abruption of the thought
which <br>
comes from the use of points.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>(We observe the same thing in children <br>
to-day, whose usage in this
particular is a striking and beautiful <br>
instance of the law that the
infancy of individuals reproduces the <br>
methods and stages of development
characterizing the infancy of <br>
races.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>In the work of these primitive scribes all the punctuation is <br>
found,
by the modern investigator with his optical instruments and <br>
chemical
tests, to have been inserted by the writers' ingenious and <br>
serviceable
collaborator, the common house-fly -- _Musca maledicta_.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><br>
In transcribing these ancient MSS, for
the purpose of either making <br>
the work their own or preserving what they
naturally regard as divine <br>
revelations, later writers reverently and
accurately copy whatever <br>
marks they find upon the papyrus or parchment,
to the unspeakable <br>
enhancement of the lucidity of the thought and value
of the work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><br>
Writers contemporary
with the copyists naturally avail themselves of <br>
the obvious advantages of
these marks in their own work, and with such <br>
assistance as the flies of
their own household may be willing to <br>
grant, frequently rival and
sometimes surpass the older compositions, <br>
in respect at least of
punctuation, which is no small glory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Fully to <br>
understand the important services that flies perform to
literature it <br>
is only necessary to lay a page of some popular novelist
alongside a <br>
saucer of cream-and-molasses in a sunny room and observe
&quot;how the wit <br>
brightens and the style refines&quot; in accurate
proportion to the <br>
duration of exposure.<br>

<br>
HAG, n.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>An
elderly lady whom you do not happen to like; sometimes <br>
called, also, a
hen, or cat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Old witches, sorceresses,
etc., were <br>
called hags from the belief that their heads were surrounded
by a kind <br>
of baleful lumination or nimbus -- hag being the popular name
of that <br>
peculiar electrical light sometimes observed in the hair.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At one time <br>
hag was not a word of
reproach:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Drayton speaks of a
&quot;beautiful hag, <br>
all smiles,&quot; much as Shakespeare said,
&quot;sweet wench.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It would not
<br>
now be proper to call your sweetheart a hag -- that compliment is <br>
reserved
for the use of her grandchildren.<br>
<br>
HALF, n.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>One of two equal parts into which a thing may be divided, or
<br>
considered as divided.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the
fourteenth century a heated discussion <br>
arose among theologists and
philosophers as to whether Omniscience <br>
could part an object into three
halves; and the pious Father <br>
Aldrovinus publicly prayed in the cathedral
at Rouen that God would <br>
demonstrate the affirmative of the proposition in
some signal and <br>
unmistakable way, and particularly (if it should please
Him) upon the <br>
body of that hardy blasphemer, Manutius Procinus, who
maintained the <br>
negative.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Procinus, however, was spared to die of the bite of a <br>
viper.<br>
<br>
HALO,
n.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Properly, a luminous ring encircling
an astronomical body, <br>
but not infrequently confounded with
&quot;aureola,&quot; or &quot;nimbus,&quot; a <br>
somewhat similar phenomenon
worn as a head-dress by divinities and <br>
saints.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The halo is a purely optical illusion, produced by moisture
<br>
in the air, in the manner of a rainbow; but the aureola is conferred
<br>
as a sign of superior sanctity, in the same way as a bishop's mitre,
<br>
or the Pope's tiara.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the
painting of the Nativity, by Szedgkin, a <br>
pious artist of Pesth, not only
do the Virgin and the Child wear the <br>
nimbus, but an ass nibbling hay from
the sacred manger is similarly <br>
decorated and, to his lasting honor be it
said, appears to bear his <br>
unaccustomed dignity with a truly saintly
grace.<br>
<br>
HAND, n.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A singular
instrument worn at the end of the human arm and <br>
commonly thrust into
somebody's pocket.<br>
<br>
HANDKERCHIEF, n.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>A small square of silk or linen, used in various <br>
ignoble offices
about the face and especially serviceable at funerals <br>
to conceal the lack
of tears.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The handkerchief is of recent
<br>
invention; our ancestors knew nothing of it and intrusted its duties
<br>
to the sleeve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Shakespeare's
introducing it into the play of <br>
&quot;Othello&quot; is an
anachronism:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Desdemona dried her nose
with her skirt, <br>
as Dr. Mary Walker and other reformers have done with
their coattails <br>
in our own day -- an evidence that revolutions sometimes
go backward.<br>
<br>
HANGMAN, n.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>An
officer of the law charged with duties of the highest <br>
dignity and utmost
gravity, and held in hereditary disesteem by a <br>
populace having a criminal
ancestry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In some of the American
States <br>
his functions are now performed by an electrician, as in New
Jersey, <br>
where executions by electricity have recently been ordered -- the
<br>
first instance known to this lexicographer of anybody questioning the
<br>
expediency of hanging Jerseymen.<br>

HARMONISTS, n.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>A sect of Protestants, now extinct, who came from <br>

&quot;the true use and function of property (in <br>

stuff, or anything which may
be named as holden of right to one's own <br>
subservience) as also of honors,
titles, preferments and place, and <br>
all favor and acquaintance of persons
of quality or ableness, are but <br>
to get money.<span style="mso-spacerun:

rated as
of worth in measure of their serviceableness to that end; and <br>
their
possessors should take rank in agreement thereto, neither the <br>
lord of an
unproducing manor, howsoever broad and ancient, nor he who <br>
bears an
unremunerate dignity, nor yet the pauper favorite of a king, <br>
being
esteemed of level excellency with him whose riches are of daily <br>

J is a
consonant in English, but some nations use it as a vowel -- <br>
than which
nothing could be more absurd.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Its
original form, which has <br>
been but slightly modified, was that of the tail
of a subdued dog, and <br>
it was not a letter but a character, standing for a
Latin verb, <br>
_jacere_, &quot;to throw,&quot; because when a stone is
thrown at a dog the <br>
dog's tail assumes that shape.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is the origin of the letter, as <br>
expounded
by the renowned Dr. Jocolpus Bumer, of the University of <br>
Belgrade, who
established his conclusions on the subject in a work of <br>
three quarto
volumes and committed suicide on being reminded that the <br>
j in the Roman

<br>
<br>
K is a
consonant that we get from the Greeks, but it can be traced <br>
away back
beyond them to the Cerathians, a small commercial nation <br>
inhabiting the
peninsula of Smero.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In their tongue it
was called <br>
_Klatch_, which means &quot;destroyed.&quot;<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The form of the letter was <br>
originally
precisely that of our H, but the erudite Dr. Snedeker <br>
explains that it
was altered to its present shape to commemorate the <br>
destruction of the
great temple of Jarute by an earthquake, _circa_ <br>
730 B.C.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This building was famous for the two lofty
columns of its <br>
portico, one of which was broken in half by the
catastrophe, the other <br>
remaining intact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>As the earlier form of the letter is supposed to <br>
have been
suggested by these pillars, so, it is thought by the great <br>
antiquary, its
later was adopted as a simple and natural -- not to say <br>
touching -- means
of keeping the calamity ever in the national memory.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span><br>
It is not known if the name of the letter was altered as an
additional <br>
mnemonic, or if the name was always _Klatch_ and the
destruction one <br>
of nature's pums.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>As each theory seems probable enough, I see no <br>
objection to
believing both -- and Dr. Snedeker arrayed himself on <br>
that side of the
question.<br>

countenance, as which nothing has so divine
splendor, O Noonday Sun of <br>
the Universe!&quot;<br>
<span

that the mirror be <br>

naught but <br>
idle lumber.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And the
mirror was dimmed with dust and overlaced with <br>
cobwebs.<span

he commanded that the
ungrateful courtier be thrown into prison, and <br>
that the glass be repaired
and taken back to his own palace; and this <br>
was done.<span

he saw not his <br>
image as before, but only the figure of a crowned ass,
having a bloody <br>
bandage on one of its hinder hooves -- as the artificers
and all who <br>
had looked upon it had before discerned but feared to
report.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Taught <br>
wisdom and
charity, the king restored his courtier to liberty, had the <br>
mirror set
into the back of the throne and reigned many years with <br>
justice and
humility; and one day when he fell asleep in death while <br>
on the throne,
the whole court saw in the mirror the luminous figure <br>

SCARIFICATION, n.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A
form of penance practised by the mediaeval pious.<span style="mso-spacerun:

The rite was performed, sometimes with a knife, sometimes
with a hot <br>

penitent <br>
spared himself no pain nor harmless disfigurement.<span

with other crude
penances, has now been superseded by benefaction.<span style="mso-spacerun:

The founding of a library or endowment of a university is
said to <br>
yield to the penitent a sharper and more lasting pain than is
<br>
conferred by the knife or iron, and is therefore a surer means of <br>
grace.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There are, however, two grave objections to
it as a <br>

word &quot;sincere&quot; is

formerly closed from
public scrutiny.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Either view of the

her
seat in the abdomen -- in which faith we may discern and interpret <br>

truth hitherto unintelligible, namely that the glutton is of all men <br>

devout.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He is said in the Scripture to
'make a god of his belly' <br>

majesty that he
shrines?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Truly and soberly, the soul

are one Divine Entity; and such was the belief of Promasius,
who <br>
nevertheless erred in denying it immortality.<span

its visible and

the body after
death, but of its immaterial essence he knew nothing.<span style="mso-spacerun:

This is what we call the Appetite, and it survives the

anchovies, _pates de

mule,

ape of an ape; for the clown himself imitated the

</span>The zany was progenitor to the specialist in humor, as <br>
we to-day
have the unhappiness to know him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In
the zany we see an <br>
example of creation; in the humorist, of
transmission.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Another <br>
excellent
specimen of the modern zany is the curate, who apes the <br>
rector, who apes
the bishop, who apes the archbishop, who apes the <br>

ZANZIBARI,
n.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>An inhabitant of the Sultanate of
Zanzibar, off the <br>
eastern coast of Africa.<span style="mso-spacerun:

known in this
country through a threatening diplomatic incident that <br>
occurred a few
years ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The American consul at the
capital occupied <br>
a dwelling that faced the sea, with a sandy beach
between.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Greatly to <br>
the scandal
of this official's family, and against repeated <br>
remonstrances of the
official himself, the people of the city <br>
persisted in using the beach for
bathing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One day a woman came down
<br>
to the edge of the water and was stooping to remove her attire (a pair
<br>
of sandals) when the consul, incensed beyond restraint, fired a charge
<br>
of bird-shot into the most conspicuous part of her person.<span

Unfortunately for the existing
_entente cordiale_ between two great <br>
nations, she was the Sultana.<br>

ZENITH, n.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The point
in the heavens directly overhead to a man <br>
standing or a growing
cabbage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A man in bed or a cabbage in
the pot <br>
is not considered as having a zenith, though from this view of
the <br>
matter there was once a considerably dissent among the learned, some
<br>
holding that the posture of the body was immaterial.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These were <br>
called Horizontalists,
their opponents, Verticalists.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
<br>
Horizontalist heresy was finally extinguished by Xanobus, the <br>
philosopher-king
of Abara, a zealous Verticalist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Entering an <br>
assembly of philosophers who were debating the matter,
he cast a <br>
severed human head at the feet of his opponents and asked them
to <br>
determine its zenith, explaining that its body was hanging by the
<br>
heels outside.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Observing that it
was the head of their leader, the <br>
Horizontalists hastened to profess
themselves converted to whatever <br>
opinion the Crown might be pleased to
hold, and Horizontalism took its <br>
place among _fides defuncti_.<br>

who have
touched upon the shores of America, and one who professes to <br>
have penetrated
a considerable distance to the interior, have thought <br>
that these four
names stand for as many distinct deities, but in his <br>
monumental work on
Surviving Faiths, Frumpp insists that the natives <br>
are monotheists, each
having no other god than himself, whom he <br>
worships under many sacred
names.<br>
