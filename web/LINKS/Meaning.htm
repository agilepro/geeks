<B>Finding Meaning in a Contingent Universe</b>, by Michael Shermer<p>

I am often asked by believers why I abandoned Christianity and how I found<br>
meaning in the apparently meaningless universe presented by science. The<br>
implication is that the scientific world-view is an existentially depressing<br>
one. Without God, I am bluntly told, what's the point? If this is all there<br>
is, there is no use. To the contrary. For me quite the opposite is true. The<br>
conjuncture of losing my religion, finding science, and discovering glorious<br>
contingency was remarkably empowering and liberating. It gave me a sense of<br>
joy and freedom. Freedom to think for myself. Freedom to take responsibility<br>
for my own actions. Freedom to construct my own meanings and my own<br>
destinies. With the knowledge that this may be all there is, and that I can<br>
trigger my own cascading changes, I was free to live life to its fullest.<p>

This is not to say that those who are religious cannot share in these<br>
freedoms. But for me, and not just for me, a world absent monsters, ghosts,<br>
demons, and gods unfetters the mind to soar to new heights, to think<br>
unthinkable thoughts, to imagine the unimaginable, to contemplate infinity<br>
and eternity knowing that no one is looking back. The universe takes on a<br>
whole new meaning when you know that your place in it was not foreordained,<br>
that it was not designed for us, indeed, that it was not designed at all. If<br>
we are nothing more than star stuff and bio mass, how special life becomes.<br>
If the tape were played again and again without the appearance of our<br>
species, how extraordinary becomes our existence, and, correspondingly, how<br>
cherished. To share in the sublimity of knowledge generated by other human<br>
minds, and perhaps even to make a tiny contribution toward that body of<br>
knowledge that will be passed down through the ages, part of the cumulative<br>
wisdom of a single species on a tiny planet orbiting an ordinary star on the<br>
remote edge of a not-so-unusual galaxy, itself a member of a cluster of<br>
galaxies millions of light years from nowhere, is sublime beyond words.<p>

Since we are such a visual primate, perhaps images can help capture the<br>
feeling. The Hubble Telescope Deep Field photograph in Figure 10-3, revealing<br>
as never before the rich density of galaxies in our neck of the universe, is<br>
as grand a statement about the sacred as any medieval cathedral. How vast is<br>
the cosmos. How contingent is our place. Yet out of this apparent<br>
insignificance emerges a glorious contingency--the recognition that we did<br>
not have to be, but here we are. In fact, compare this slice of the cosmos to<br>
two of the most hallowed and sacrosanct structures on Earth--both medieval in<br>
age but on opposite sides of the planet, literally and figuratively: Machu<br>
Picchu and Chartres Cathedral. Machu Picchu captures the numina through an<br>
interlocking relationship between nature and humanity that generated in me an<br>
almost mystical connection across space and time with the ancients that had<br>
once lived and loved atop this 8,000-foot precipice. This is the "lost city"<br>
in so many ways. When I stood inside Chartres Cathedral with my soul mate,<br>
lit candles, and promised each other our eternal love, it was a more sacred<br>
moment than any I have experienced. Skeptics and scientists cannot experience<br>
the numinous? Nonsense. You do not need a spiritual power to experience the<br>
spiritual. You do not need to be mystical to appreciate the mystery. Standing<br>
beneath a canopy of galaxies, atop a pillar of reworked stone, or inside a<br>
transcept of holy light, my unencumbered soul was free to love without<br>
constraint, free to use my senses to enjoy all the pleasures and endure all<br>
the pains that come with such love. I was enfranchised for life, emancipated<br>
from the bonds of restricting tradition, and unyoked from the rules written<br>
for another time in another place for another people. I was now free to try<br>
to live up to that exalted moniker--Homo sapiens--wise man.<br>
