<h1 align=center>Human Ancestors May Have Interbred With Chimpanzees</h1>

<p>When the ancestors of human beings and the ancestors of chimpanzees
parted ways 6.3 million years ago, it was probably a very long goodbye. Some
of their descendants may even have gone back for a final tryst.
<p>That is the conclusion a group of scientists has reached, using a
comparison of the genes of humans and their closest animal relatives to
sketch a picture of human origins far more detailed than what fossil bones
have revealed.</p>

<p>According to the new theory, chimps and humans shared a common apelike
ancestor much more recently than was thought. Furthermore, when the two
emerging species split from each other, it was not a clean break. Some
members of the two groups seem to have interbred about 1.2 million years
after they first diverged -- before going their separate ways for good.
<p>If this theory proves correct, it will mean modern people are descended
from something akin to chimp-human hybrids. That is a new idea, and it
challenges the prevailing view that hybrids tend to die out.
<p>It also strongly suggests that some of the oldest bones of "proto-humans"
-- including the 7 million-year-old Toumai skull unearthed in Chad in 2001
-- may have belonged to a line of non-hybrids that died out, and were not
human ancestors at all.
<p>This narrative, by a team of geneticists and biostatisticians from the
Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard,
not only casts new light on the origin of humans, but also raises questions
about how all new species arise.
<p>"This is contributing to the idea that species are kind of fuzzy. They
become real over time, but it takes millions of years," said James Mallet, a
geneticist at University College London who was not involved in the new
research. "We probably had a bit of a messy origin."
<p>The research is the latest fruit of the Human Genome Initiative, the
effort to transcribe and read out the entire genetic message of human
chromosomes, which was completed in 2003.
<p>The evidence of ancestral chimp and human interbreeding emerged from
comparing parts of their genomes to each other and to those of gorillas,
orangutans and macaques. The scientists now want to know whether similar
"hybridization events" happened between other emerging species.
<p>The separation into two species "left a footprint on our genome that we
can go back and read," said Eric S. Lander of MIT. "We were never able to
look at things like this before. What we need to do now is to collect more
data and look for other smoking guns."
<p>Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes that contain about 30,000 genes. Each
gene is made of strands of DNA "letters" in a specific order, and the
letters can change, by mutation, over time. The rate at which changes occur
is fairly constant -- and very slow.
<p>As a result, genetic mutations can be used as a kind of evolutionary
clock. The number of DNA differences between two species' versions of the
same gene is an indication of how long the species have been separate -- how
long since individuals were last interbreeding and sharing genes.
<p>When Nick Patterson of MIT and his colleagues at the Broad Institute
compared the genes of humans and chimps, they found that one of the
chromosomes -- the female sex chromosome X -- was 1.2 million years younger
than the others. It appeared the two species shared a common ancestor who
gave them both their X chromosomes, and did so more recently than the
ancestors who gave them all the other chromosomes.
<p>The best explanation, the scientists think, is that ancient humans and
chimps broke away from each other not once, but twice. The first time was
more than 6.3 million years ago. The second time was at least a million
years later.
<p>What probably happened was that some of the evolving human ancestors bred
with the evolving chimps. This was perhaps not as strange as it seems, for
although there were some physical differences between the two groups, "the
early humans must have looked pretty much like chimpanzees," said Mallet,
the London geneticist.
<p>Males have only one X chromosome, which is necessary for reproduction. As
is often the case with hybrids, the male offspring from these unions would
probably have been infertile.
<p>But the females, which have two X chromosomes, would have been fertile.
If some of those hybrid females then bred with proto-chimp males, some of
their male offspring would have received a working X from the chimp side of
the family. They would have been fertile -- and with them the hybrid line
would have been off and reproducing on its own.
<p>The evolutionary clock indicates this happened no more than 6.3 million
years ago, and perhaps as recently as 5.4 million years ago. In that case,
the fossils of older species -- such as Toumai, or <i>Sahelanthropus
tchadensis,</i> a proto-man from Chad that had a humanlike brow and probably
walked on two feet -- must have belonged to descendants of the first
human-chimp divergence.
<p>That line must have died out. If it had not, modern man's X chromosome
would look as old (or nearly as old) as the other chromosomes.
<p>"I think the most interesting thing [is] this idea that long, extended
gene flow seems to have occurred and that this might be a creative mode of
evolution," said David Reich, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School. He is
one of the authors of the study, which appears in today's issue of the
journal Nature.
<p>The idea that new species emerge in a slow and stuttering fashion was
favored by Charles Darwin, Mallet said. But in the early part of the 20th
century, biologists came to favor the idea of clean breaks, with the "pure"
lines of emerging species being stronger and fitter than hybrids.
<p>In fact, Mallet said, about 10 percent of animal species are capable of
interbreeding with related species, even though the number that do so in any
population is very small.
