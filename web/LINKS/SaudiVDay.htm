<h2>Saudi Morality Police See Red Over Valentine Roses</h2>
Sun Feb 13, 2005<br>

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's morality police are
on the scent of illicit red roses as part of a clampdown on would-be
St Valentine's lovers in the strict Muslim kingdom.<p>
The Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice,
Saudi Arabia's powerful religious vigilantes, have banned shops from
selling any red flowers in the run-up to February 14.<p>
Florists say the move is part of an annual campaign by the committee -
- whose members are known as "mutawwaeen" or volunteers -- to prevent
Saudis marking a festival they believe flouts their austere doctrine
of "Wahhabi" Islam.<p>
"They pass by two or three times a day to check we don't have any red
flowers," said a Pakistani florist in Riyadh's smart Sulaimaniya
district.&nbsp; "Look, no red.&nbsp; I've taken them all out," he said pointing
to a dazzling floral collection covering every color of the rainbow
except one.<p>
Saudi Arabia's purist version of Islam recognizes only two religious
occasions a year -- the Muslim feasts after the fasting month of
Ramadan and the Haj pilgrimage.<p>
Celebration of the Islamic New Year or the Prophet Mohammad's
birthday, common in other Muslim countries, is frowned upon in Saudi
Arabia.<p>
Valentine's Day, or the "Feast of Love" in Arabic, is beyond the pale
in a country where women must cover themselves from head to toe in
public and be accompanied by a male guardian.<p>
"For the last week, we've had no red in the shop," said Ahmed, a
flower shop manager.&nbsp; "You can't even have red cards."<p>
Despite the prohibition, demand for the banned roses has been strong
and unofficial business was booming, Ahmed said.<p>
"Wait 10 minutes," he told one customer as an assistant slipped into
the shadows to collect a bouquet of crimson flowers.&nbsp; At 10 riyals
($2.70) each they were double the usual price.&nbsp; "They would put us in
prison for this," he smiled.<p>
Another customer asked if he could deliver 30 red roses to Riyadh's
diplomatic quarter, a potentially tricky mission which meant crossing
a tight police security cordon.&nbsp; "No problem," Ahmed said.&nbsp; "That's the
regular police, not the mutawwaeen."<p>
The government-funded mutawwaeen patrol the streets of Saudi Arabia,
particularly Riyadh in the Wahhabi heartland, ensuring women are
covered and five daily Muslim prayers are observed.<p>
Shopkeepers who fail to shut down for half an hour during each prayer
risk a night in jail if they are discovered.<p>
Despite government calls for them to show greater leniency, and some
recent efforts to improve their own image, the bearded volunteers are
not universally popular.<p>
"The mutawwaeen are just backward," Ahmed complained.&nbsp; "It's the Saudi
women who want these roses anyway."<p>
