<h1>The Holocaust wasn't Christian</h1>
<b>Pope Benedict obscured the truth in his Auschwitz address by
ignoring anti-Semitism and the Catholic Church's failures.</b>
<p>By Daniel Jonah Goldhagen<br>
May 31, 2006
<p>CERTAIN RARE moments provide politicians and religious leaders the
setting to etch emblematic statements or gestures in historical
consciousness. At a commemoration ceremony in 1970, German
Chancellor Willy Brandt dropped spontaneously to his knees with
evident emotion and contrition (even though he himself had been an
enemy of Nazism) at the monument to the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. John
Paul II, upon becoming in 1986 the first pope ever to visit Rome's
synagogue, unforgettably referred to the assembled Jews, humbly, as
"our elder brothers."
<p>Pope Benedict XVI had such a moment before him on Sunday at
Auschwitz. In this time of resurgent Holocaust denial by the
president of Iran and others, Benedict's visit was historically and
politically important. This German pope reaffirmed with his presence
and words the falsity and mendacity of Holocaust denial. He came, he
said, as "a duty before the truth."
<p>Yet the good he did by visiting Auschwitz was
overshadowed by the address he delivered there, which
offered none of Brandt's genuine emotion nor John Paul's
humility and which failed to heed his own
self-proclaimed duty to truth. Instead, Benedict clouded
historical understanding, evaded moral responsibility
and shirked political duty.
<p>Benedict falsely exonerated Germans from their
responsibility for the Holocaust by blaming only a "ring
of criminals" who "used and abused" the duped and
dragooned German people as an "instrument" of
destruction. In truth, Germans by and large supported
the Jews' persecution, and many of the hundreds of
thousands of perpetrators were ordinary Germans who
acted willingly. It is false to attribute culpability
for the Holocaust wholly or even primarily to a
"criminal ring." No German scholar or mainstream
politician would today dare put forth Benedict's
mythologized account of the past.
<p>Benedict did say correctly that the "rulers of the Third
Reich wanted to crush the entire Jewish people." But he
then turned the Holocaust into an assault most
fundamentally not on Jews but on Christianity itself, by
falsely asserting that the ultimate reason the Nazis
wanted to kill Jews was "to tear up the taproot of the
Christian faith" — meaning that their motivation to kill
Jews was because Judaism was the parent religion of
Christianity.
<p>
As every historian, and even the casual student, knows —
and as the church's historians ordinarily take pains to
emphasize — the German perpetrators saw the Jews as a
malevolent and powerful "race," not a religious group.
Their desire to annihilate Jews had nothing to do with
anti-Christianity.
<p>
Benedict's failure to say that Auschwitz was
overwhelmingly a death factory designed for Jews, or
that the Germans slaughtered Jews because they hated
Jews, is part of his overall failure to confront the
centrality of the Holocaust in the Germans' mass
murdering. It is of course laudable to acknowledge and
remember that the Germans murdered other peoples, but 1
million of Auschwitz's 1.1 million victims were Jews.
Yet Benedict, not even mentioning this, devoted fewer
than 200 of almost 2,300 words explicitly to the
slaughter of the Jews.
<p>
Benedict's historical fabrication to Christianize the
Holocaust is also a moral scandal because it obscures
the troubling truth about the Catholic Church: Its
churches across Europe tacitly and actively participated
in the Jews' persecution. Pope Pius XII, the German
bishops, French bishops, Polish church leaders and many
others, animated by anti-Semitism, supported or called
for the persecution of the Jews (though not their
slaughter). Some, such as Slovakian church leaders and
Croatian priests, actively endorsed or participated in
the mass murder.
<p>In this and other ways, Benedict severed and obscured
all connection between the Catholic Church, Christianity
and the Holocaust, which is a huge step backward from
the positions that John Paul II adopted.
<p>Stunningly, Benedict walked through the gates of
Auschwitz and did not once mention the prime mover of
the Holocaust: anti-Semitism (let alone the
anti-Semitism of Christianity that was for centuries
ubiquitous in Europe and that culminated in Nazism and
the Holocaust). Whatever differences existed between
Nazi anti-Semitism and its Christian anti-Semitic
seedbed, anti-Semitism is the unavoidable causal,
historical and moral link connecting the church, the
Nazis and Auschwitz.
<p>Since Vatican II, the church has forcefully condemned
anti-Semitism, even declaring it a sin. Yet Benedict
stood in Auschwitz negligently silent.
<p>At length Benedict wondered about where God was. A
churchman's question. But he conspicuously failed to ask
where the church was. Benedict's appeal to the mysteries
of God's ways thus obscured even the most discussed
aspects of the church's and Pius XII's conduct during
the Holocaust: Why they didn't speak out. Why they
didn't do more to help Jews.
<p>Benedict has shown much goodwill in continuing to
improve the church's relations with Jews today. But with
his whitewashing of the past — exonerating both the
German perpetrators and the church, universalizing the
Holocaust and deemphasizing its purely anti-Jewish
thrust — he turns the clock back on what the Catholic
Church had, in the decade before his papacy, been
acknowledging: that the church must confront the
anti-Semitism of its past, that many Catholics
participated in the Jews' persecution; that the church
should have aided the assaulted people more.
<p>And, most of all, that the church must, in the words of
the French bishops' 1997 declaration, confess its "sin"
and utter "words of repentance." Only then can Benedict
rightly approach the victims to ask for reconciliation.
