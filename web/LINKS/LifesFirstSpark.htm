<h1>Life's First Spark Recreated in the Laboratory</h1>* By Brandon Keim<br>* May 13, 2009<p>
A fundamental but elusive step in the early evolution of life on
Earth has been replicated in a laboratory.<p>
Researchers synthesized the basic ingredients of RNA, a molecule from
which the simplest self-replicating structures are made. Until now,
they couldn't explain how these ingredients might have formed.<p>
"It's like molecular choreography, where the molecules choreograph
their own behavior," said organic chemist John Sutherland of the
University of Manchester, co-author of a study in Nature Wednesday.<p>
RNA is now found in living cells, where it carries information
between genes and protein-manufacturing cellular components.
Scientists think RNA existed early in Earth's history, providing a
necessary intermediate platform between pre-biotic chemicals and DNA,
its double-stranded, more-stable descendant.<p>
However, though researchers have been able to show how RNA's
component molecules, called ribonucleotides, could assemble into RNA,
their many attempts to synthesize these ribonucleotides have failed.
No matter how they combined the ingredients - a sugar, a phosphate,
and one of four different nitrogenous molecules, or nucleobases -
ribonucleotides just wouldn't form.<p>
Sutherland's team took a different approach in what Harvard molecular
biologist Jack Szostak called a "synthetic tour de force" in an
accompanying commentary in Nature.<p>
"By changing the way we mix the ingredients together, we managed to
make ribonucleotides," said Sutherland. "The chemistry works very
effectively from simple precursors, and the conditions required are
not distinct from what one might imagine took place on the early
Earth."<p>
Like other would-be nucleotide synthesizers, Sutherland's team
included phosphate in their mix, but rather than adding it to sugars
and nucleobases, they started with an array of even simpler molecules
that were probably also in Earth's primordial ooze.<p>
They mixed the molecules in water, heated the solution, then allowed
it to evaporate, leaving behind a residue of hybrid, half-sugar,
half-nucleobase molecules. To this residue they again added water,
heated it, allowed it evaporate, and then irradiated it.<p>
At each stage of the cycle, the resulting molecules were more
complex. At the final stage, Sutherland's team added phosphate.
"Remarkably, it transformed into the ribonucleotide!" said Sutherland.<p>
According to Sutherland, these laboratory conditions resembled those
of the life-originating "warm little pond" hypothesized by Charles
Darwin if the pond "evaporated, got heated, and then it rained and
the sun shone."<p>
Such conditions are plausible, and Szostak imagined the ongoing cycle
of evaporation, heating and condensation providing "a kind of organic
snow which could accumulate as a reservoir of material ready for the
next step in RNA synthesis."<p>
Intriguingly, the precursor molecules used by Sutherland's team have
been identified in interstellar dust clouds and on meteorites.<p>
"Ribonucleotides are simply an expression of the fundamental
principles of organic chemistry," said Sutherland. "They're doing it
unwittingly. The instructions for them to do it are inherent in the
structure of the precursor materials. And if they can self-assemble
so easily, perhaps they shouldn't be viewed as complicated."
