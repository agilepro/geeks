<b><h1 align=center>EUROPE'S DARK SHAME</h1></b>
Emperor Constantine, born Flavius
Valerius Aurelius (274-337 C.E.), of a
Christian mother and pagan Emperor
Constantine Chlorus, transformed
Christianity from squabbling groups into
a coherent religion and installed it
into power at his right hand. The Bible
said the all the right things for a man
with many enemies.<p>
<b>The Rise of Christianity</b><br>
In <b>312</b> Constantine defeated
Maxentius’s army at the battle of
Milvian Bridge, leaving his claim to Rome
unchallenged. His personal god was Sol
Invictus – the Invincible Sun, and his
attitude to Christianity was dictated by
expediency and the need for unity. He
wanted stability, harmony and unity -
one empire, one emperor; one god, and
one religion for his army. <p>
In <b>313</b> he issued, conjointly
with Licinius (the Emperor of the
Eastern Empire), the Milan Decree which
forbade persecution of all forms of
monotheism, effectively giving civil
rights and toleration of Christians
throughout the empire.<p>
To control his empire Constantine used
the administrative network of the
Christian church, and by <b>318</b> he
had already given the Bishops all the
rights and privileges of the pagan high
priests. That made the Christian
ministry a career not just a vocation.<p>
In the year <b>323</b> Constantine’s
army attacked and defeated his
co-emperor, Licinius, who fought under
the old Republican deities.
Constantine’s army had fought under the
Chi-Rho sign and the battle-cry was
“Deus Summus Salvator!” – God, the
Highest Saviour!<p>
He was now Emperor of the whole Roman Empire.<p>
<b>Christians Elevate Constantine to Messiah</b><br>
In Constantine’s time Christian
tradition had not yet become immutable
dogma. They placed Constantine
as their Messiah – he had succeeded
where Jesus had failed. A Messiah was a
military and political figure – a king
with a mandate to govern.<p>
He summoned the Council of Nicaea in
<b>325</b>. The result was a unified and
rationalized Christianity – but to suit
his own ideas and needs Catholicism as
it is known today derives ultimately
from this Council of Nicaea -
Catholicism arrived by vote!
Bishops became a branch of the imperial
civil service.<p>
In <b>326</b> Constantine gave the
shrine of Helios Apollo in Rome to the
Christians for the foundation of their
new church, St. Peter.<p>
In his later years he became
increasingly vicious. He boiled alive
his own wife, although Christian, and
strangled to death his own relatives.
His favourite way of killing those who
opposed him was to hang them up
inverted, cut their throat, and watch
them die. It would take a prolonged time
as blood remained in the head.<p>
Such a “Messiah” set the foundations of
the Church for centuries to come.<br>
He died in <b>337</b>.<p>
<b>The Fall of Human-Friendly Paganism</b><br>
Constantine never persecuted pagans but
his three sons did. In <b>340</b> a ban
was put on pagan sacrifices in the
eastern empire, being described as
‘superstitious’ and ‘unsoundness of
thinking.’ In <b>342</b> this ban was
applied to the whole empire.
In <b>346</b> public sacrifices were
banned and pagan practice was punishable
by death.<p>
Emperor Julian, a pagan, was named as a
successor and marched into
Constantinople in December <b>361</b>.
He repealed the laws of religious
persecution of the pagans, but died in
battle in <b>363</b>.<p>
Theodosius (346-395) was a pious but
intolerant Christian. He became
principle Emperor in <b>379</b>.
In <b>380</b>, he issued the following
decree:<br>
<i>“We shall believe in the single deity of
the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit,
under the concept of equal majesty and
of the Holy Trinity.<br>
WE COMMAND THAT: Those persons who
follow this rule shall embrace the name
of Catholic Christians.<br>
The rest, however, whom we adjudge
demented and insane, shall sustain the
infamy of HERETICAL dogmas, their
meeting places shall not receive the
name of churches, and they shall be
smitten, FIRSTLY, by DIVINE Vengeance;
SECONDLY by retribution of our own
initiative, which we shall arrive in
accordance with DIVINE Judgment.”</i><p>
All of paganism in the Roman Empire
became heretical and could be destroyed
- officially.<p>
The Western Emperor, Gratien, removed
the Alter of Victory in Rome and
disbanded the Vestal Virgins and their
sacred fire was put out. The whole
of Rome was stunned.<p>
That same year Gratien was murdered -
killed by a barbarian!<p>
Pagan writer Libanus, writing in <b>390</b>,
complained bitterly to Theodosius about
the behaviour the Christian monks:
“.. the men in black … attack the
temples with stones, poles and iron
crowbars, or even their bare hands and
feet. Then, roofs are knocked in and the
walls levelled to the ground, the
statues are overturned and the alters
demolished. The temple priests must
suffer in silence, or die. These
outrages occur in the towns; it is worse
in the countryside amongst the slaves.<p>
In <b>390</b> a Christian mob burned
down the Library at Alexandria and the
ancient manuscripts were lost for ever.
<p>Principle emperor Theodosius’s cruelty
is demonstrated in the case when a
rebellion against his intolerance had
led to the lynching of the Governor of
Thessalonica, he called a meeting of the
citizens on some pretext and then
ordered their massacre; 7,000 people
were summarily executed.<br>
After that, in <b>391</b> he ordered the
closing of all the temples and banned
all forms and types of pagan cults and
worship.
In <b>392</b> in a further decree, he
declared pagan worship
illegal. This criminalized all pagan
worship in the newly Christianized Roman
Empire.<p>
In <b>394</b> the pagan majority
rebelled. After decades of expecting the
Christians to go away, the pagans fought
back. The old Roman habit of obedience
to authority was perhaps weaker in the
East. There were battles in the streets.
Bishop Marcellus, having sent a party of
soldiers and gladiators to destroy a
temple, was seized by the enraged people
and burned alive. At Alexander some of
the temple wreckers were crucified.<p>
But there was no concept of a universal
pagan religion or an overall pagan
organization within the empire. Pagan
writers were unwilling or unable to
attack Christianity as a barbarous blind
belief or otherwise demonstrate the
shortcoming of Christianity. The
inability to supply credible
alternatives had undermined Julian’s
efforts to re-impose paganism by state
power in the <b>360</b>'s.<p>
Generally, the pagans were disunited
(like Buddhists) with no central
leadership to overcome the problems.
They were unable to match the
organization and manipulations of the
Christians to reach power.<p>
<b>And Paganism’s near Disappearance</b><br>
Over the following years Christianity
became more powerful with more and more
religious fanatics appointed to high
office. Christianity would not tolerate
other religions - they were not just
‘different’ – they were in ERROR!<p>
Pagans were persecuted and their temples
knocked down and destroyed.<br>
John Chrysostom was the Archbishop of Constantinople. His fanatical followers,
dressed in black, had their way -
destroying most of the artwork and the
learning of the ancient world - in their
zeal to discover and eradicate sin. (Sin
is a crime against God as detailed and
described in the Bible.)<p>
In the East of the empire, anti-pagan
legislation had been continuous.
Monasteries and Nunneries had been
founded and gangs of black robed monks
roamed the cities and countryside
desecrating temples and urging mobs to
destroy them, while the civil
authorities turned a blind eye.<p>
This set the pattern in the empire for
1400 long years – the abyss of the ‘Dark
Ages’ - the period of severe, inhuman
RELIGIOUS suppression terminated only by
Napoleon Bonaparte in the early 1800s.<p>
<b>A Terrible Repression</b><br>
“As soon as Constantine
gave official recognition as a religion,
the Church started to harass both
Christians and non-Christians who were
not in agreement with her ideas.<p>
“Such behaviour became a tradition. It
lasted and progressed for more than a
thousand years... The apex of her
intolerance eventually became epitomized
by the Inquisition.
This latter, in the Spanish Inquisition,
terrorized the whole of Europe for more
than five centuries.<p>
“Her claim of being the ONLY holder of
TRUTH, the fountain spring of her
historic intolerance, has never been
revoked by her. She has maintained it
with ever increasing resolution and
ferocity until our own days. All her
past actions bespeak of the constancy of
such immutable intolerance. Since the
fourth century C.E. her conduct has been
patterned on nothing else.”
(from <i>The Vatican’s Holocaust</i>)<p>
The monks had unlimited powers and these
inquisitors swarmed all over Europe like
theological hornets, setting up
tribunals wherever they appeared. For
centuries all hopes and dreams died;
people were in utter despair of life –
religious controls were everywhere.<p>
Fear and uncertainty ruled people's
lives -fear of the Canus Dominii
(Dominican Monks) and the Franciscan
Monks accompanied by their "Jacks" - the
men who did the torture with benches,
ropes and iron hooks, ceiling hooks,
rough iron implements and fire.<p>
Europe under the control of Rome was
blighted. Peoples' lives were
arbitrarily terminated for such crimes
as questioning or doubting the doubtful
stories as given in the Bible. Countless
human victims were burned to ashes
accompanied by prayers. Torture and
burning alive in public was widespread.
(A recent museum exhibition showed
instruments including a vaginal (or
anal) expandable plug – useable red-hot
or cold)) Every village in Europe
had a duck pond and a ducking stool.<p>
As the Dark Ages matured and deepened,
methods of killing became more
imaginative and brutal. Where salt was
available, skinning alive (flaying)
could be employed. This is where the
heretic or whoever, was tied down and
flayed alive and then salt rubbed into
the raw flesh by the Monk’s “Jacks.”
Those few who survived the initial shock
would be then be manhandled to the
nearest dung pit and thrown in, or
whatever occurred in the minds of his
torturers.<p>
The heretic’s skin was nailed to a
church door as a warning to
disbelievers. (Note of interest: when
they renovated the great Winchester
Cathedral (U.K.) wooden doors recently
they found human skin caught in a crack
deep in the wood!)<p>
A feeling for the times is gained from
the fact that men had their tongues cut
out for swearing - defaming God is
blasphemy.<p>
<b>Treatment of Illness</b><br>
Illness was regarded as the consequence
of sin. This was formalised by the
Fourth Lateran Council of 1215, which
forbade doctors, under threat of
excommunication, to treat a sick patient
who had not first confessed his sins.
<p>The imposition of hands, exorcism of
evil spirits and prayer were the major,
approved methods used by Christian
doctors. Plagues were fought by means of
processions around the town and services
of intercession.<br>
All died young. Great plagues and
epidemics surged across Europe
unhindered. Most people died prematurely
from tuberculosis, plagues, disease,
cold and starvation.<p>
<b>The Church’s Prolonged Preoccupation
with Controlling People’s Sexuality</b><br>
Sex and love were controlled too. Sex
was only for the purpose of maintaining
the population. (SEX was a sin, and so
European children must be baptized to
wash away the circumstances of their
sinful birth, even now.)<p>
Catholicism demanded that all sexual
intercourse had to be purely mechanical
and impersonal while wearing a linen (or
flax) cagool (nightshirt) with the
necessary hole. There was only one
official position allowed. The Church
laid down punishments for deviations
from this official position.<p>
Sex was prohibited on Sundays,
Wednesdays and Fridays, amounting to
almost half the year. In addition, it
was forbidden during the forty days of
Lent, forty days before Christmas and so
on. It was also forbidden three days
before receiving Communion. It was
forbidden with barren women or women
post menstruation and so also was oral
or anal sex forbidden. If a man
had an involuntary nocturnal emission,
this was also an act of sin; the
compensating act of penance for this was
to get up and recite three Psalms
immediately. The next morning he had to
recite another thirty Psalms. All the
family went to the confessional, nothing
could be kept secret.<p>
The Church’s penitential books
prescribed the most severe punishments
for masturbation, which St. Thomas
Aquinas described as a greater sin than
visiting a prostitute. (Sodomy - a
contraceptive method using the legs was
also such a heinous sin!)<p>
Private or auricular confessions proved
to be an excellent weapon for achieving
this domination of all sex life by the
Church. Passion and lust were sins and
incurred a penalty – as was the sin of
loving. Love was illegal; people's lives
were not their own. People were very
depressed and led wretched, impoverished
lives.<p>
This was the European religious “Dark
Ages.” Experts put the death toll at
about 10,000,000 people including about
2,000,000 witches (mostly old women)
killed or burned to death - 1400 years
at the hands of religious fanatics who
searched out people with heretical ideas
and also those who sinned - that is,
committed a crime against GOD as
determined by the Bible!<p>
It was the irreconcilable opposition of
faith to rational thought, which led to
ignorant, brutalized men and women. In
contrast, in pagan Rome and Greece even
the lowest people could read and write,
but in the European “Dark Ages,” there
was neither education, books, nor
medicines - people were illiterate and
primitive. All previous pagan learning
was lost.<p>
<b>Repression in All Spheres of Life</b><br>
It was a time when the Christian spirit
permeated and shaped and moulded
everything; the private and the public
sphere of life, the family, the
education, the economy, and politics.
When the popes were so powerful they
could name and depose emperors and kings
at will.<p>
What was the result? – an endless series
of wars ravaged Europe. Popes and
bishops appeared in armour as generals
on horseback leading their troops.
Countless peasants, villains, who often
owned no more than their clothes, had to
spend their whole life in dreary
serfdom, cultivating the huge estates of
their spiritual and secular feudal lords
- or fighting their lord and master's
enemies - the poor from elsewhere. (From
<i>The Misery of Christianity</i>)<p>
It was a time of severe religious
oppression when nothing could take place
unless blessed by the Holy Mother
Church. It resulted in
suppression of the people's thoughts,
feelings, hopes and even love, by
penalties, torture and death. It was the
original concept of 'big-brother is
watching you.'<p>
<b>Banning and Concealing the Horror</b><br>
Now, NO-ONE talks of this two-thirds of
European history.<p>
“This Vatican terror officially ended
less than two hundred years ago. As
recently as 1762 a Protestant Pastor was
condemned to death in France. Why?
Simply because he was a Protestant! By
whom? By the Catholic Church! Yes!
By that same which now pretends to love
her ‘dear separated brethren.’<p>
It should be remembered that the
Inquisition was banned, against her
will, only during the middle of the last
century; the “Holy Office,” its inspirer
and instrument, was ‘abolished’ only a
few years ago. In fact, it is still
operating, disguised under the specious
name “Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith,”
in the silent walls of the Vatican of today.<p>
The basic Catholic claims have not
changed one single iota. The Catholic
Church’s insistence about her own
uniqueness has remained as granitically
firm now as it always has been. These
are the same claims which produced the
Inquisition, Croatia, and the Catholic
dictatorship of Vietnam. (<i>The Vatican’s Holocaust</i>)
<p><b>The Church's False Foundations</b><br>
Recent research and analysis by
university scholars have shown serious
flaws and discrepancies to the stories
given in the Bible, but these factual
analyses debunking the Bible are hidden
from the worshipping followers, and
archaeologists working in the Middle
East find no evidence whatever, for any
of the stories in the Bible. It is all
an elaborate but fabricated theology.<p>
The Dark Ages affected, severely, more
than a billion Europeans over the
period. But nothing is researched or
even discussed. Sssh! No talking about
our past horrors!<p>
