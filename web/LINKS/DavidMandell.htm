<hr><p><h3>No Santa, No God</h3>
Fremont, CA. Argus Newspaper, 7/9/02<p>
Hurray for Michael Newdow the atheist! He had
the courage to convince the federal court that the
Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional because it
endorses religion with the words "under god". Mr.
Newdow being an atheist was humiliated to have his 2nd
grade daughter say under god, when he knows very well
no god exists, never has existed, or ever will exist.
And how does he know? For the same logical reason
he knows there is no Santa Clause. Believe it or not.
It's ludicrous for 47 million atheists in this country
to recite the P.O.A. with "under god" included.
Atheists are moral, decent, patriotic, responsible,
loving, educated, hard working people. Religion is an
unscrupulous psychological system to mind control
unaware people. Any psychologist will tell you that. It
has caused more suffering, mental anguish, violence,
wars, and medical set backs than any other philosophy.<br>
Please let's keep state and church separate for the
good of our country.

<h3>Science needed for us to progress</h3>
Fremont, CA. Argus newspaper, 12/12/01<p>
The DEC. 6 Argus editorial gave an excellent
explanation on the topic, "California Ignores science
education in Schools".<p>
One paragraph in particular states: "Rather than
taking a holistic approach and giving our children the
best comprehensive education possible, we're leaving
big holes in what they know."<p>
Besides scholastic holes in their curriculums, they
are deprived of the biggest gift of all- their ability
to reason logically in an illogical world. Because
logic is the bases of all science, every child
therefore needs science in order to exercise their
powers of reasoning.<p>
Is it then any wonder that there is such a conflict
between science and religion?<p>
Science develops the mind to think with reason and
logic. Religion does not.<p>
Science has to prove with certitude its statements and
accomplishments. Religion does not.<p>
Regretfully for religion, science disproves many - if
not all - of its suppositions. And that is the hidden
underlying reason for not teaching science in schools.<p>
Are we as human beings going to progress intellectually
or stay stagnate with continuing religious degenerative teachings?<p>
Albert Einstein said: " One thing I have learned in a
long life: that all our science, measured against
reality, is primitive and childlike - and yet it is the
most precious thing we have."

<hr><p><h3>Wall Of Seperation</h3>
Fremont, CA. Argus newspaper, 8/29/02<p>
The First Amendment and Article VI of the Constitution
was written by our founding fathers who were not
christians but diests. Deism is a system of thought
advocating natural religion based on human reason rather
than a god or bible. The founders were well aware they were
creating a secular state. There is no mention of God
or a supreme being in the constitution or in the Bill
of Rights.<p>
Since the wall of seperation between church and state
is established that means our federal, state, county,
and city governments have no power to tell anybody who
to worship or who not to worship. It is none of their
business! It also means no religious dictators, like
Ayotullah Khomeini; no government endorsing
Christianity, Judaism, Islamics, Santanism, God, or
any religion for that matter. No blasphemy laws, no
church taxes, no national religion, no praying in
public schools or government buildings, no nativity
scenes on public land, no ten commandments displayed
in court rooms, and no crosses entrenched on public lands.<p>
We should be grateful to Madison and Jefferson for the
wall of separation that protects us all. The freedom
to believe as one will regarding religion is the ultimate
freedom of the human mind and final approval of self-government.

<hr><p><h3>Westboro Baptists Wrong</h3>
Fremont, CA. Argus Newspaper, 10/18/02<p>
I am a member of Atheists of Silicon Valley, www.godlessgeeks.com, and we deplore the Kansas Westboro Baptist Church condemning the Newark Memorial High School for performing "The Laramie Project". They sound like they are completly brainwashed by their religion. Too bad religion does not teach human compassion based on plain common sense. Since I know there is no God, devil, heaven or hell; I don't need
any bible to tell me what to do and what to believe. I know what is right and what is wrong. Therefore it's only appropriate for me to protest the brainwashed baptists when they arrive in Newark. I urge all people to show the Westboro Baptists that they are definitely positively, unequivocally, unquestionably wrong!
<p>

<hr><p><h3>BLAME RELIGION</h3>
Fremont, CA. Argus newspaper, Jan. 31, 2003<p>
In a Jan. 13 letter to the editor, Dan Tracy wrote that despite a few bad priests and bishops in the Catholic Church, the church actively addresses many injustices in the world. Really? It probably is a few THOUSAND bad priests and bishops. The injustices to people, created by not only the Catholic Church, but also by all religions are, insurmountable compared to the good. The first and foremost evil is mental anguish from FEAR created by all religions. If you don't follow their doctrines, the punishment is mental torture in this world, and burning in hell in their imaginary next life. This cruel brainwashing of malleable children's minds amounts to ABUSE, and more often than not remains effective throughout adulthood. The adults are so brainwashed that they are afraid not to believe, and cannot recognize it because they still are subject to the mind control. Simply believing in a god is mental abuse, because this all-powerful, all- knowing god can punish you painfully whenever he chooses. This is the psychology of all religions and why it is so dangerous to everyone. Sept. 11 is one example of religious terror by Muslim fanatics. But what about religious terror of the individual? This encompasses the whole world and is by far the worse.<p>
Lest we forget, religion is the cause of more human suffering, loss of life and scientific stifling than any other institution.

<hr><p><h3>Jesus club</h3>
Fremont, CA. Argus newspaper, July 9, 2003<p>
WARNING to all parents of James Logan High School students: Your child may be enticed by the "Youth Alive For Jesus Club."<p>
Members may offer your child free soda, pizza and ice cream. But what they don't tell you are the pitfalls of their religion.<p>
Suicide, anxieties, depression, family relation problems, social problems, and conning you from your money and time.<p>
Religion has caused more misery to all men in every state of history than any other single idea.<p>

<hr><p><h3>ABSURD AND LUDICROUS</h3>
Fremont, CA. Argus newspaper, April 4, 2004<p>
On March 31, Robert Hunziber wrote taking God out of the Pledge of Allegiance is totally wrong. I say it is totally right for three reasons.<p>
First, "under God" in the pledge is being sanctioned by the government, a violation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; printed at the bottom of this page. This First Amendment means separation of church and state by a million miles. I'm sure people don't want their government to tell them what church to go to, or have them pay religious taxes, or have religious laws govern them. Second, the "under God" is an insult to the intelligence of 40 million godless patriotic Americans. Third, the dictionary defines God as being supernatural. Supernatural does not exit. God does not exit. God is nothing. So to have the powerful country of the United States under nothing is absurd and ludicrous.<p>

<hr><p><h3>In for a surprise</h3>
Fremont, CA. Argus newspaper, August 2, 2004<p>
BOY, IS Bush in for a surprise this coming election.
Little does he know that the atheists, freethinkers, secular humanists and other nonbelievers now have political clout. They have formed GAMPAC -- "Godless Americans Political Action Committee." Of course the GAMPAC has endorsed Kerry/Edwards. John Kerry is way more intelligent than Bush and will make an excellent president.<p>

<hr><p><h3>Religious rhetoric</h3>
Fremont, CA. Argus Newspaper, Jan. 6, 2005<p>
As an atheist, it always amazes me how people can pray after a disaster, but never blame God for causing it in the first place. God killed more than 150,000 people with a tsunami. Is this a merciful God? I don't think so. To say God had a purpose in killing innocent people and children is insane. This terrible tragedy only proves one simple thing: There is no God, only religious rhetoric.<p>
David M. Mandell<br>
Fremont<p>

<hr><p><h3>Insulted</h3>
Fremont, CA. Argus Newspaper, March 7, 2005<p>
I agree with The Argus Feb. 23 editorial, "Thou shalt not go overboard." that the Pleasanton lawyer is nitpicking about removing the Ten Commandments from a seal.<p>
However a massive stone copy of the Ten Commandments in Texas ( "Justices hear Ten Commandments cases," ) March 3 is another matter.  To subject atheists to this religious monument is disgusting. To have my tax dollars support any religious symbol on public property is a rip-off and insulting. The stone Decalogue on public property amounts to a governmental imposition of monotheism.<p>
I'm sick and tired of religionists sneaking around the First Amendment to get their demented messages to the public.<p>
It's just too bad that religion is on a decline in the United States. I guess people are getting too smart to believe that religious brain-washing rhetoric anymore. Well good for them.  Religion has caused more suffering and pain than any other man-made idea.<p>

<hr><p><h3>No Saint</h3>
Argus Newspaper Fremont, CA, April 25, 2005<p>
Well, Pope John Paul II is dead. So what.<p>
After reading about him it's obvious the pope was no saint.<p>
You would think with all the millions of people mourning over him, he was a saint. But he wasn't. The only
good thing he did was wave his arms and hands blessing everybody.<p>
I would say as an atheist, he was an excellent public relations man. But what did he do that was so bad?<p>
The worst is that he banned condoms in Africa resulting in millions of babies who would die because their
mothers had no milk. Banning condoms also caused thousands of HIV deaths, and left families throughout the
world producing so many kids that they have to live in squalor.<p>
Next he ordered bishops in the U.S. to oppose civil rights laws that protect gays and lesbians
(including hate-crime laws), leaving them outside the boundaries of legal protection.<p>
Then he told heterosexuals what to do:  no contraceptives, no premarital sex, no oral sex, no anal sex,
no masturbation, no remarriage, no divorce, no artificial insemination, no three-ways, no swinging, no
sterilization, no legal abortion, no stem cell research, no women priests, and no death with dignity
because your forced to live against your wishes.<p>
And lets not forget he didn't stop the priests from sexually abusing thousands of children.<p>

<hr><p><h3>Knowledge is our goal</h3>
June 6, 2005 in the Fremont, CA.  Argus newspaper.<p>
I'M ECSTATIC over the atheist rally held in San Francisco on May 20-22. It was a huge success.<p>
Its main purpose was to confront the rise of religion in politics.<p>
The movie I saw May 21 was "The God Who Wasn't There." It was really interesting because it gave the true documentation of Jesus Christ by historians and scholars.<p>
From watching the movie, you came to a conclusion that Jesus Christ was nothing more than a folk fable. So to believe in Jesus Christ, you must rely on faith alone. But of course faith means without evidence.<p>
So where does that leave you? Simply believing in something that does not exist. And of course, that's a common thing to do with a lot of people who don't care about the facts.<p>
I used to believe in Santa Claus until my friend told me my parents lied to me. They finally apologized; however, I couldn't trust them after that.<p>
Well, because the atheists in the Bay Area are growing so fast, it won't be long before the government takes notice.<p>
Just think, in the near future, instead of "In God we trust" on our money, it will have something really important, like "Knowledge is our goal."<p>
Remember, religion has caused more suffering and misery to humanity than any other idea.<p>

<hr><p><h3>Ludicrous</h3>
July 23, 2005 in the Fremont Argus Newspaper<p>
REGARDING THE July 19 news brief, "Judge 'narrows' lawsuit over pledge," I congratulate Michael Newdow, the only atheist who's got the guts to challenge the U.S. government about "Under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance.<p>
Not everybody is brainwashed into believing the word God stands for a supreme being protecting our country.<p>
There are at least 40 million atheists in the United States who look at the word God as it really is. An imaginary supernatural ludicrous thing.<p>
Do we want our country protected by a supernatural thing? I don't think so. So let's get rid of it.<p>
Good luck to Newdow on his lawsuit. I hope that this time he will win.<p>
Remember, religion is the biggest mental fraud ever devised by man.<p>

<h3>Religious brainwashing</h3>
Argus Newspaper 10/5/2005<p>
REGARDING THE Sept. 27 letter, "Sneaky Christians," I agree with Walter Hecker that Christians are very
sneaky in pushing their religion onto everyone.<p>
They sneaked "Under God" in the Pledge and "In God We Trust" on our money.<p>
If they had their way, they would abolish the First Amendment to the Constitution.<p>
Guess what they're trying to sneak into the public school classrooms now? Religion masquerading as science,
creationism under a new name — intelligent design.<p>
The Sept. 27 Argus had an article titled, "Court battle begins over teaching of 'intelligent design.'" They will
go to any means to get their brainwashing messages across to innocent minds.<p>
To discredit science for religious gain is a desperate and losing battle for the sneaky Christians.<p>
They already lost in the Scopes Monkey Trial and the Creationist Trial. And now they will lose in the
intelligent design trial because truth and reality of science will overpower religious brainwashing.<p>
When will religionists learn that a supernatural imaginary God can do nothing for them?<p>
Religion is a hoax. Remember there is no God; only religious brainwashing.<p>

<h3>Brainwashed</h3>
I THINK it's high time the psychologists of the world expose religion for what it really is: A mental sickness.<p>
It's obvious that people who believe in God, spirits, angels, holy ghosts, the supernatural, Jesus Christ, Allah, Yahweh, snake healing, spiritual aliens, Satan, evil spirits, the Bible, Torahs, Korans, heaven and hell are simply crazy.<p>
Or to be psychologically correct — brainwashed.<p>
It's also obvious that religion is the source of the world's problems.<p>
Let's get rid of this cancer of the mind called religion and have a peaceful, productive, knowledgeable, intelligent, happy world.<p>

<h3>WHERE'S THE MUSLIM OUTRAGE TO A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE?<br>
OUTRAGED MUSLIMS! OH MY!</h3>
We wake up this morning to see video on CNN showing
rampaging Muslims around the world.&nbsp; In Europe, the
Middle East, the Pacific Rim ...&nbsp; Muslim Mobs
spreading mayhem.&nbsp; It seems that these mighty mad
Muslims are rioting and firing their ever-present
AK-47s into the air because of cartoons.&nbsp; Yup ... this
latest epidemic of Muslim outrage comes to us because
some newspapers in Norway and Denmark published some
cartoons depicting Mohammed.&nbsp; In fact ... here is one
of my favorites!<p> 
Admit it, this turban/bomb thing could be the next big
fashion hit on the Muslim street!<p>
Muslim outrage huh.&nbsp; OK ... let's do a little
historical review.&nbsp; Just some lowlights:<br>
* Muslims fly commercial airliners into buildings
in New York City.&nbsp; No Muslim outrage.<br>
* Muslim officials block the exit where school
girls are trying to escape a burning building because
their faces were exposed.&nbsp; No Muslim outrage.<br>
* Muslims cut off the heads of three teenaged
girls on their way to school in Indonesia.&nbsp; A
Christian school.&nbsp; No Muslim outrage.<br>
* Muslims murder teachers trying to teach Muslim
children in Iraq.&nbsp; No Muslim outrage.<br>
* Muslims murder over 80 tourists with car bombs
outside cafes and hotels in Egypt.&nbsp; No Muslim outrage.<br>
* A Muslim attacks a missionary children's school
in India.&nbsp; Kills six.&nbsp; No Muslim outrage.<br>
* Muslims slaughter hundreds of children and
teachers in Beslan, Russia.&nbsp; Muslims shoot children in
the back.&nbsp; No Muslim outrage.<br>
* Let's go way back.&nbsp; Muslims kidnap and kill
athletes at the Munich Summer Olympics.&nbsp; No Muslim
outrage.<br>
* Muslims fire rocket-propelled grenades into
schools full of children in Israel.&nbsp; No Muslim
outrage.<br>
* Muslims murder more than 50 commuters in attacks
on London subways and busses.&nbsp; Over 700 are injured.
No Muslim outrage.<br>
* Muslims massacre dozens of innocents at a
Passover Seder.&nbsp; No Muslim outrage.<br>
* Muslims murder innocent vacationers in Bali.&nbsp; No
Muslim outrage.<br>
* Muslim newspapers publish anti-Semitic cartoons.
 No Muslim outrage.<br>
* Muslims are involved, on one side or the other,
in almost every one of the 125+ shooting wars around
the world.&nbsp; No Muslim outrage.<br>
* Muslims beat the charred bodies of Western
civilians with their shoes, then hang them from a
bridge.&nbsp; No Muslim outrage.<br>
* Newspapers in Denmark and Norway publish
cartoons depicting Mohammed.&nbsp; Muslims are outraged.<p>

Dead children.&nbsp; Dead tourists.&nbsp; Dead teachers.&nbsp; Dead
doctors and nurses.&nbsp; Death, destruction and mayhem
around the world at the hands of Muslims .. no Muslim
outrage ... but publish a cartoon depicting Mohammed
with a bomb in his turban and all hell breaks loose.
Come on, is this really about cartoons?  They're
rampaging and burning flags.&nbsp; They're looking for
Europeans to kidnap.&nbsp; They're  threatening innkeepers
and generally raising holy Muslim hell not because of
any outrage over a cartoon.&nbsp; They're outraged because
it is part of the Islamic jihadist culture to be
outraged.&nbsp; You don't really need a reason.&nbsp; You just
need an excuse.&nbsp; Wandering around, destroying
property, murdering children, firing guns into the air
and feigning outrage over the slightest perceived
insult is to a jihadist what tailgating is to a
Steeler's fan.<p>
I know and understand that these bloodthirsty
murderers do not represent the majority of the world's
Muslims.&nbsp; When, though, do they become outraged?  When
do they take to the streets to express their outrage
at the radicals who are making their religion the
object of worldwide hatred and ridicule?  Islamic
writer Salman Rushdie wrote of these silent Muslims
in a New York Times article three years ago.&nbsp; "As
their ancient, deeply civilized culture of love, art
and philosophical reflection is hijacked by
paranoiacs, racists, liars, male supremacists,
tyrants, fanatics and violence junkies, why are they
not screaming?"<p>
Indeed.&nbsp; Why not?<p>

<h3>NO FAVORS</h3>
4/12/2006<p>
Referencing A March 31 article in the Washington Post, "Prayers don't heal, study finds."<p>
After 10yrs. and 2.4 million dollars scientists have found out what atheists have known since religions have been invented. What a waste of time and money to find out the obvious. Praying works the same as flipping a coin. It's a waste of time and energy. How in the world can mumbling to yourself heal anyone anyhow?<p>
The Atheists of Silicon Valley, www.godlessgeeks.com, and I were delighted but not surprised to read the findings. They found out also that the people who knew they were being prayed too became more sick. That tells me forget the foolish praying. Don't do me any favors.<p>

<h3 align=center>Atheists are good</h3>
I THINK the next president of the United States should be an atheist. The "Freedom From Religion Foundation" (www.ffrf.org) agrees with me.<p>
Why? Because, contrary to the rhetoric of religious leaders throughout the world, atheists are good, hardworking, honest, decent, patriotic, moral people.<p>
"A-theist" means "not theist." Atheists do not believe in gods, devils, angels, ghosts or other imaginary creatures. Instead, we simply accept reality.<p>
About 14 percent of Americans are atheists. We experience life's joys and pains fully, without religion's dulling insulation. We respect science and learning, knowing that only human effort and courage will bring individual freedom and cultural progress. We are responsible for our own actions, and often choose a higher standard of morality than religious people, who may promote hatred and violence.<p>
We want to live natural, religion-free lives. We patriotically promote our U.S. constitutional right of freedom from religion and protest any government support of religion. We invite others to join us in peacefully promoting atheism and protecting our rights.<p>

<h3 align=center>A drop of reason</h3>
THE HINDU American Foundation will release a report in Washington, D.C., on the worldwide abuses, discrimination and harassment of its people.<p>
The Muslims, Christians and Jews have done the same thing in the past to the United Nations and human rights groups. It looks like they all hate each other to me.<p>
So what else is new?<p>
What is new to you is old to me: that all religions hate atheists, too, and why? Simply because the atheists expose them for what they really are — con artists.<p>
Religionists are the biggest liars in the world; and what's more pathetic is they believe their own lies. Remember, the main purpose of all religions is mind control, but through self-esteem and critical thinking, anyone can overcome that.
For a drop of reason in a pool of confusion, go to "infidels.org," an educational nonprofit organization.
"Religion has ever been anti-human, anti-woman, anti-life, anti-peace, anti-reason and anti-science. The God idea has been detrimental not only to humankind but to the Earth.

THE INSANITY of religion is becoming more evident every day. If the Pope can't make a comment about the Muslims without them becoming hysterical, then it's obvious the world is dealing with insane people.<p>
It's the sane against the insane. One religion against another. Atheists against religionists. It goes on and on, but when will it ever end? It will end when the crazies die off and the atheists dominate the world. Atheists of Silicon Valley, http://www.godlessgeeks.com, agree with me.
