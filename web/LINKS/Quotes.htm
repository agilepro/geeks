"Reason should be destroyed in all Christians."<br>
— <a href=http://www.nobeliefs.com/luther.htm>Martin Luther</a><p>

"Whoever wants to be a Christian should tear the eyes out of his reason."<br>
— Martin Luther<p>

"Reason is the greatest enemy that faith has; it never comes to the aid of spiritual things, but more frequently than not struggles against the divine Word, treating with contempt all that emanates from God."<br>
— Martin Luther<p>

"Reason is the Devil's greatest whore; by nature and manner of being she is a noxious whore; she is a prostitute, the Devil's appointed whore; whore eaten by scab and leprosy who ought to be trodden under foot and destroyed, she and her wisdom ... Throw dung in her face to make her ugly. She is and she ought to be drowned in baptism... She would deserve, the wretch, to be banished to the filthiest place in the house, to the closets."<br>
— Martin Luther, <i>Erlangen Edition</i> v. 16, pp. 142-148<p>

"Reason must be deluded, blinded, and destroyed. Faith must trample underfoot all reason, sense, and understanding, and whatever it sees must be put out of sight and ... know nothing but the word of God."<br>
— Martin Luther<p>

"We know that reason is the Devil’s harlot, and can do nothing but slander and harm all that God says and does… Therefore keep to revelation and do not try to understand."<br>
— Martin Luther<p>

"What harm would it do, if a man told a good strong lie for the sake of the good and for the Christian church? [...] a lie out of necessity, a useful lie, a helpful lie, such lies would not be against God, he would accept them."<br>
— Martin Luther<p>

"... we must drive them [Jews] out like mad dogs, so that we do not become partakers of their abominable blasphemy and all their other vices and thus merit God's wrath and be damned with them."<br>
— Martin Luther, "On the Jews and Their Lies", 1543<p>

"There is another form of temptation, even more fraught with danger. This is the disease of curiosity. It is this which drives us to try and discover the secrets of nature, those secrets which are beyond our understanding, which can avail us nothing and which man should not wish to learn."<br>
— St. Augustine (354 — 430), one of the "great" church fathers, <i>Confessions</i><p>

"I believe because it is absurd."<br>
— Tertullian (c. 155 – c. 240), notable early Christian apologist<p>

"We have no need of curiosity after we have Christianity, nor of inquisitiveness after we have the Gospel."<br>

"The gravest of the ecclesiastical historians, Eusebius himself, indirectly confesses that he has related whatever might redound to the glory, and that he has suppressed all that could tend to the disgrace, of religion."<br>

"Theology is the most certain of all sciences since its source is divine knowledge (which cannot be deceived) and because of the greater worth of its subject matter, the sublimity of which transcends human reason."<br>
— Thomas Aquinas, <i>Summa Theologiae</i> (1265–1274)<p>

"Unbelief is the greatest of sins."<br>
— Thomas Aquinas, ibid.<p>

"Now it seems that everything in the world stems from sources other than God, since the products of nature have their source in nature; deliberate effects can be traced back to human reason or will as their source. There is no need then to assume that God exists."<br>
— Thomas Aquinas, ibid., I, Question 2, Article 3<p>

"With regard to heretics there are two points to be observed, one on their side, the other on the side of the Church. As for heretics their sin deserves banishment, not only from the Church by excommunication, but also from this world by death. To corrupt the faith, whereby the soul lives, is much graver than to counterfeit money, which supports temporal life. Since forgers and other malefactors are summarily condemned to death by the civil authorities, with much more reason may heretics as soon as they are convicted of heresy be not only excommunicated, but also justly be put to death."<br>
— Thomas Aquinas, ibid., Question 11, Article 3<p>

"The opinion formulated by the Church has more value in my eyes than human reasons, whatever they may be."<br>

— The Apostle Paul, Romans 3:7 (KJV)<p>

"A person is to be punished with a just penalty, who ... utters blasphemy, or gravely harms public morals, or rails at or excites hatred of or contempt for religion or the Church."<br>
— The Catholic Church's Canon Law 1369<p>

"The mysteries of the faith are not to [be] explained rashly to anyone. Usually in fact, they cannot be understood by everyone but only by those who are qualified to understand them with informed intelligence. The depth of the divine Scriptures is such that not only the illiterate and uninitiated have difficulty understanding them, but also the educated and the gifted."<br>
— Pope Innocent III in 1199<p>

"Kill them all, for God knows His own."<br>
— Pope Innocent III, to his troops in the Albigensian Crusade of 1209<p>

— Council of Toulouse: Canon 14, 1229<p>

"…the right of holding slaves is clearly established in the Holy Scriptures, both by precept and example… Had the holding of slaves been a moral evil, it cannot be supposed that the inspired Apostles … would have tolerated it for a moment in the Christian Church. In proving this subject justifiable by Scriptural authority <a href="BibleQuotes.htm#luke_12_42">[Luke 12:47]</a>, its morality is also proved; for the Divine Law never sanctions immoral actions."<br>
— Richard Furman, Baptist State Convention, letter to South Carolina Governor, 1822<p>

"God is introduced to give dignity and emphasis ... and then He is banished. It was this very atheistic Declaration [of Independence] which had inspired the 'higher law' doctrine of the radical antislavery men. If the mischievous abolitionists had only followed the <a href="BibleQuotes.htm#slavery">Bible</a> instead of the godless Declaration, they would have been bound to acknowledge that human bondage was divinely ordained. The mission of southerners was therefore clear; they must defend the word of God against abolitionist infidels."<br>
— Thomas Smyth, minister of 2nd Presbyterian Church of Charleston, S.C. 11/21/1861<p>

"Slavery itself ... is not at all contrary to the natural and divine law... The purchaser [of the slave] should carefully examine whether the slave who is put up for sale has been justly or unjustly deprived of his liberty, and that the vendor should do nothing which might endanger the life, virtue, or Catholic faith of the slave."<br>
— Vatican statement, 1866<p>

"I was at this time living, like so many Atheists or Antitheists, in a whirl of contradictions. I maintained that God did not exist. I was also very angry with God for not existing. I was equally angry with Him for creating a world."<br>

"Quantum healing is healing the bodymind from a quantum level. That means from a level which is not manifest at a sensory level. Our bodies ultimately are fields of information, intelligence and energy. Quantum healing involves a shift in the fields of energy information, so as to bring about a correction in an idea that has gone wrong. So quantum healing involves healing one mode of consciousness, mind, to bring about changes in another mode of consciousness, body."<br>
— <a href=http://www.skepdic.com/chopra.html>Dr Deepak Chopra</a><p>

"Consciousness may exist in photons, which seem to be the carrier of all information in the universe."<br>

"As for the Jews, I am just carrying on with the same policy which the Catholic Church has adopted for fifteen hundred years, when it has regarded the Jews as dangerous and pushed them into ghettos etc., because it knew what the Jews were like.

— Duane Gish, <i>Evolution, The Fossils Say No!</i> p. 42<p>

"The body of scientific evidence supporting creation science is as strong as that supporting evolution. In fact, it may be stronger… The evidence for evolution is far less compelling than we have been led to believe. Evolution is not a scientific “fact,” since it cannot actually be observed in a laboratory. Rather, evolution is merely a scientific theory or “guess.”… It is a very bad guess at that. The scientific problems with evolution are so serious that it could accurately be termed a “myth.”"<br>
— Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, dissenting opinion on <a href=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/482/578#writing-USSC_CR_0482_0578_ZD>Edwards v. Aguillard</a><p>

(2) calling on all people of the United States —

"Science shares with religion the claim that it answers deep questions about origins, the nature of life, and the cosmos. But there the resemblance ends. Scientific beliefs are supported by evidence, and they get results. Myths and faiths are not and do not."<br>

"Since all organisms inherit all their genes from their ancestors, rather than from their ancestors' unsuccessful contemporaries, all organisms tend to possess successful genes. They have what it takes to become ancestors — and that means to survive and reproduce. This is why organisms tend to inherit genes with a propensity to build a well-designed machine — a body that actively works as if it is striving to become an ancestor. That is why birds are so good at flying, fish so good at swimming, monkeys so good at climbing, viruses so good at spreading. That is why we love life and love sex and love children. It is because we all, without a single exception, inherit all of our genes from an unbroken line of successful ancestors. The world becomes full of organisms that have what it takes to become ancestors. That, in a sentence, is Darwinism."<br>

"Natural selection is the blind watchmaker, blind because it does not see ahead, does not plan consequences, has no purpose in view. Yet the living results of natural selection overwhelmingly impress us with the appearance of design as if by a master watchmaker, impress us with the illusion of design and planning."<br>

"Another meme of the religious meme complex is called faith. It means blind trust the absence of evidence, even in the teeth of evidence. The story of Doubting Thomas is told, not so that we shall admire Thomas, but so that we can admire the other apostles in comparison. Thomas demanded evidence. Nothing is more lethal for certain kinds of meme than a tendency to look for evidence. The other apostles, whose faith was so strong that they did not need evidence, are held up to us as worthy of imitation. The meme for blind faith secures its own perpetuation by the simple unconscious expedient of discouraging rational inquiry."<br>

"You cannot be both sane and well educated and disbelieve in evolution. The evidence is so strong that any sane, educated person has got to believe in evolution."<br>
— Richard Dawkins, "My Short Interview with Richard Dawkins" by Lanny Swerdlow<p>

"Evolution is a fact, as securely established as any in science, and he who denies it betrays woeful ignorance and lack of education, which likely extends to other fields as well. Evolution is not some recondite backwater of science, ignorance of which would be pardonable. It is the stunningly simple but elegant explanation of our very existence and the existence of every living creature on the planet."<br>
— Richard Dawkins<p>

"The distribution of species on islands and continents throughout the world is exactly what you'd expect if evolution was a fact. The distribution of fossils in space and in time are exactly what you would expect if evolution were a fact.

The last vestige of respect for the taboo disappeared as I watched the 'Day of Prayer' in Washington Cathedral, where people of mutually incompatible faiths united in homage to the very force that caused the problem in the first place: religion. It is time for people of intellect, as opposed to people of faith, to stand up and say 'Enough!' Let our tribute to the dead be a new resolve: to respect people for what they individually think, rather than respect groups for what they were collectively brought up to believe."<br>

You outlawed them from the universities or any teaching careers, besmirched their reputations, banned or burned their books or their writings of any kind, drove them into exile, humiliated them, seized their properties, arrested them for blasphemy. You dehumanised them with beatings and exquisite torture, gouged out their eyes, slit their tongues, stretched, crushed, or broke their limbs, tore off their breasts if they were women, crushed their scrotums if they were men, imprisoned them, stabbed them, disembowelled them, hanged them, burnt them alive.<p>

"The danger of religious faith is that it allows otherwise normal human beings to reap the fruits of madness and consider them holy. Because each new generation of children is taught that religious propositions need not be justified in the way that all others must, civilization is still besieged by the armies of the preposterous.

"We experience happiness and suffering ourselves; we encounter others in the world and recognize that they experience happiness and suffering as well; we soon discover that 'love' is largely a matter of wishing that others experience happiness rather than suffering; and most of us come to feel that love is more conducive to happiness, both our own and that of others, than hate. There is a circle here that links us to one another: we each want to be happy; the social feeling of love is one of our greatest sources of happiness; and love entails that we be concerned for the happiness of others. We discover that we can be selfish together."<br>

"One of the monumental ironies of religious discourse that can be appreciated is the frequency with which people of faith praise themselves for their humility while condemning scientists and other non-believers for their intellectual arrogance. There is in fact, no worldview more reprehensible in its arrogance than that of a religious believer: <i>'the creator of the universe takes an interest in me, loves me, and will reward me after death; my current beliefs, drawn from scripture, will remain as the best statement of the truth until the end of the world; everyone who disagrees with me will spend an eternity in hell....'</i> An average Christian in an average church, listening to an average Sunday sermon has achieved a level of arrogance simply unimaginable in scientific discourse — and there have been some extremely arrogant scientists."<br>
— Sam Harris, <i>Letter to a Christian Nation</i>, pp. 74-75<p>

"While believing strongly, without evidence, is considered a mark of madness or stupidity in any other area of our lives, faith in God still holds immense prestige in our society. Religion is the one area of our discourse where it is considered noble to pretend to be certain about things no human being could possibly be certain about. It is telling that this aura of nobility extends only to those faiths that still have many subscribers. Anyone caught worshipping Poseidon, even at sea, will be thought insane."<br>

"Morality and values depend on the existence of conscious minds — and specifically on the fact that such minds can experience various forms of well-being and suffering in this universe. Conscious minds and their states are natural phenomena, of course, fully constrained by the laws of Nature (whatever these turn out to be in the end). Therefore, there must be right and wrong answers to questions of morality and values that potentially fall within the purview of science. On this view, some people and cultures will be right (to a greater or lesser degree), and some will be wrong, with respect to what they deem important in life."<br>

"The teachings of Christianity — from vicarious redemption to the love of enemies, no thought for the morrow need be taken, that no thrift or care or family or society or solidarity is necessary — these are immoral teachings that have done and continue to inflict untold moral and physical harm on our species. And until we outgrow this nonsense, we have no chance of emancipating ourselves."<br>

— Christopher Hitchens<p>

"Religion should be treated with ridicule, hatred, and contempt. And I claim that right."<br>
— Christopher Hitchens<p>

"We keep being told that religion, whatever its imperfections, at least instills morality. On every side, there is conclusive evidence that the contrary is the case and that faith causes people to be more mean, more selfish, and perhaps above all, more stupid."<br>
— Christopher Hitchens<p>

"Once you assume a creator and a plan, it makes us objects in a cruel experiment whereby we are created sick and commanded to be well."<br>
— Christopher Hitchens<p>

"[Religion] attacks us in our deepest integrity — the core of our self-respect. Religion says that we would not know right from wrong, we would not know an evil, wicked act from a decent human act without divine permission, without divine authority or without, even worse, either the fear of a divine punishment or the hope of a divine reward. It strips us of the right to make our own determination, as all humans always have, about what is and what is not a right human action."<br>
— Christopher Hitchens<p>

"Gullibility and credulity are considered undesirable qualities in every department of human life — except religion."<br>
— Christopher Hitchens<p>

"Why are we praised by godly men for surrendering our 'godly gift' of reason when we cross their mental thresholds?"<br>
— Christopher Hitchens<p>

"Atheism strikes me as morally superior, as well as intellectually superior, to religion. Since it is obviously inconceivable that all religions can be right, the most reasonable conclusion is that they are all wrong."<br>
— Christopher Hitchens<p>

"What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence." (a.k.a. Hitchens' razor)<br>

"If God allows proof that he exists he robs people of faith, and without faith what is God? Nothing."<br>
— Douglas Adams, <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i><p>

"If somebody votes for a party that you don't agree with, you're free to argue about it as much as you like. … But on the other hand, if somebody says, 'I mustn't move a light switch on a Saturday,' you say, 'Fine, I respect that.'"<br>

"I'd take the awe of understanding over the awe of ignorance any day."<br>

"One does not have to prove a negative. One should assume a negative."<br>
— David Eller, ibid.<p>

"Science is only truly consistent with an atheistic worldview with regards to the claimed miracles of the gods of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Moreover, the true believers in each of these faiths are atheists regarding the specific sacred tenets of all other faiths. Christianity rejects the proposition that the Quran contains the infallible words of the creator of the universe. Muslims and Jews reject the divinity of Jesus."<br>
— Lawrence Krauss, Prof. of Physics, AZ State U.<p>

— George Bernard Shaw, from "Major Barbara"<p>

"Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able?<br>
Then he is not omnipotent.<br>
Is he able, but not willing?<br>
Then he is malevolent.<br>
Is he both able and willing?<br>
Then whence cometh evil?<br>
Is he neither able nor willing?<br>
Then why call him God?"<br>
— Epicurus (c. 341-270 BCE), Greek philosopher<p>

"Either God wants to abolish evil, and cannot; or he can and does not want to.<br>
If he wants to, but cannot, he is impotent.<br>
If he can, but does not want to, he is wicked.<br>
If, as they say, God can abolish evil, and God really wants to do it, why is there evil in the world?"<br>
— Epicurus<p>

"Why should I fear death? If I am, death is not. If death is, I am not. Why should I fear that which can only exist when I do not?"<br>
— Epicurus<p>

— Plato, student and biographer of Socrates<p>

"For though a man should be a complete unbeliever in the being of gods; if he also has a native uprightness of temper, such persons will detest evil in men; their repugnance to wrong disinclines them to commit wrongful acts; they shun the unrighteous and are drawn to the upright."<br>
— Plato, acknowledging that atheists can lead an honest life, in <i>Against the Faith</i>, by Jim Herrick<p>

"The penalty that good men pay for not being interested in politics is to be governed by men worse than themselves."<br>
— Plato<p>

"Be kind; everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle."<br>
— Plato<p>

"A tyrant must put on the appearance of uncommon devotion to religion. Subjects are less apprehensive of illegal treatment from a ruler whom they consider god-fearing and pious. On the other hand, they do less easily move against him, believing that he has the gods on his side."<br>

— Edward Gibbon (1737-1794), <i>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i><p>

"Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones."<br>
— Marcus Aurelius<p>

"For me, it is far better to grasp the Universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring."<br>
— Carl Sagan (1934-1996)<p>

"The significance of our lives and our fragile planet is then determined only by our own wisdom and courage. We are the custodians of life's meaning. We long for a Parent to care for us, to forgive us our errors, to save us from our childish mistakes. But knowledge is preferable to ignorance. Better by far to embrace the hard truth than a reassuring fable. If we crave some cosmic purpose, then let us find ourselves a worthy goal."<br>
— Carl Sagan, <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1816628-pale-blue-dot-a-vision-of-the-human-future-in-space><i>Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space</i></a><p>

"If some good evidence for life after death were announced, I'd be eager to examine it; but it would have to be real scientific data, not mere anecdote. As with the face on Mars and alien abductions, better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting fantasy. And in the final tolling it often turns out that the facts are more comforting than the fantasy."<br>
— Carl Sagan<p>

"Atheism is more than just the knowledge that gods do not exist, and that religion is either a mistake or a fraud. Atheism is an attitude, a frame of mind that looks at the world objectively, fearlessly, always trying to understand all things as a part of nature."<br>
— Carl Sagan<p>

"Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality."<br>
— Carl Sagan<p>

"You can't convince a believer of anything; their belief is not based on evidence but a deep-seated need to believe."<br>
— Carl Sagan<p>

"I would love to believe that when I die I will live again, that some thinking, feeling, remembering part of me will continue. But much as I want to believe that, and despite the ancient and worldwide cultural traditions that assert an afterlife, I know of nothing to suggest that it is more than wishful thinking...there is no reason to deceive ourselves with pretty stories for which there's little good evidence."<br>
— Carl Sagan, "Parade Magazine," March 1996<p>

"Positive claims require positive evidence. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence."<br>
— Carl Sagan<p>

"If faith is a valid tool of knowledge, then anything can be true 'by faith,' and therefore nothing is true. If the only reason you can accept a claim is by faith, then you are admitting that the claim does not stand on its own merits."<br>
— Dan Barker, of <a href=http://www.ffrf.org>Freedom From Religion Foundation</a><p>

"I have something to say to the religionist who feels atheists never say anything positive: You are an intelligent human being. Your life is valuable for its own sake. You are not second-class in the universe, deriving meaning and purpose from some other mind. You are not inherently evil — you are inherently human, possessing the positive rational potential to help make this a world of morality, peace and joy. Trust yourself."<br>
— Dan Barker, <i>Losing Faith in Faith: From Preacher to Atheist</i>, 1992<p>

"You believe in a book that has talking animals, wizards, witches, demons, sticks turning into snakes, food falling from the sky, people walking on water, and all sorts of magical, absurd and primitive stories, and you say that we are the ones that need help?"<br>
— Dan Barker, ibid.<p>

"There is not a single contemporary historical mention of Jesus, not by Romans or by Jews, not by believers or by unbelievers, during his entire lifetime. This does not disprove his existence, but it certainly casts great doubt on the historicity of a man who was supposedly widely known to have made a great impact on the world. Someone should have noticed."<br>
— Dan Barker, ibid. p. 360<p>

"There is no evidence for a god, no coherent definition of a god, no good argument for a god, good positive arguments against a god, no agreement among believers about the nature or moral principles of a god, and no need for a god. We can live happy, moral, productive lives without such belief, and we can do it better."<br>
— Dan Barker<p>

"It is a fact of history and of current events that human beings exaggerate, misinterpret, or wrongly remember events. They have also fabricated pious fraud. Most believers in a religion understand this when examining the claims of other religions."<br>
— Dan Barker, "<a href=http://ffrf.org/legacy/about/bybarker/rise.php>Did Jesus Really Rise From The Dead?</a>"<p>

"We must never retreat in the face of threats or punishments dispensed by theocratic terrorists more interested in protecting their power and indulging their vanity, than in advancing the human condition."<br>
— Steve Benson, grandson of Ezra Taft Benson, president of the Mormons (1985-1994)<p>

"If, as the true believers claim, the word 'gospel' means good news, then the good news for me is that there is no gospel, other than what I can define for myself, by observation and conscience. As a freethinking human being, I have come not to favor or fear religion, but to face and fight it as an impediment to civilized advancement."<br>
— Steve Benson<p>

— Amazing James Randi<p>

"There is no room in science for the arbitrary meddling of an unknown force or being that intervenes who-knows-when to do who-knows-what for who-knows-why and who-knows-how. That’s not science; that’s just magic."<br>

<a name="einstein"></a>
"I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation, whose purposes are modeled after our own — a God, in short, who is but a reflection of human frailty. Neither can I believe that the individual survives the death of his body, although feeble souls harbor such thoughts through fear or ridiculous egotisms."<br>
— Albert Einstein (1879-1955), quoted in The New York Times obituary, 4/19/1955<p>

"It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated. I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it."<br>
— Albert Einstein, 1954, <i>Albert Einstein: The Human Side</i><p>

"I see only with deep regret that God punishes so many of His children for their numerous stupidities, for which only He Himself can be held responsible; in my opinion, only His nonexistence could excuse Him."<br>
— Albert Einstein, letter to Edgar Meyer, 1915<p>

"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a god who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings."<br>
— Albert Einstein, responding to Rabbi Herbert Goldstein's question, "Do you believe in God?"<p>

"The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature. For him neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exist as an independent cause of natural events."<br>
— Albert Einstein, <i>Science and Religion</i>, 1941<p>

"From the viewpoint of a Jesuit priest I am, of course, and have always been an atheist."<br>
— Albert Einstein, letter to Guy Raner Jr, 1945<p>

"I have repeatedly said that in my opinion the idea of a personal God is a childlike one."<br>
— Albert Einstein, letter to Guy Raner Jr, 1949<p>

"The word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honorable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish."<br>
— Albert Einstein, letter to Eric Gutkind, 1/3/1954<p>

"For me the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions."<br>
— Albert Einstein, ibid.<p>

"It seems to me that the idea of a personal God is an anthropological concept which I cannot take seriously. I also cannot imagine some will or goal outside the human sphere. … Science has been charged with undermining morality, but the charge is unjust. A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death."<br>
— Albert Einstein, "Religion and Science", 1930<p>

"The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.

— Albert Einstein, "<a href=http://www.update.uu.se/~fbendz/library/ae_scire.htm>Science and Religion</a>", 1941<p>

"If this being is omnipotent, then every occurrence, including every human action, every human thought, and every human feeling and aspiration is also His work; how is it possible to think of holding men responsible for their deeds and thoughts before such an almighty Being? In giving out punishment and rewards He would to a certain extent be passing judgment on Himself. How can this be combined with the goodness and righteousness ascribed to Him?"<br>
— Albert Einstein, <i>Out Of My Later Years</i><p>

"If people are good only because they fear punishment, and hope for reward, then we are a sorry lot indeed."<br>
— Albert Einstein<p>

"During the youthful period of mankind's spiritual evolution, human fantasy created gods in man's own image who, by the operations of their will were supposed to determine, or at any rate influence, the phenomenal world... The idea of God in the religions taught at present is a sublimation of that old conception of the gods."<br>
— Albert Einstein<p>

"The further the spiritual evolution of mankind advances, the more certain it seems to me that the path to genuine religiosity does not lie through the fear of life, and the fear of death, and blind faith, but through striving after rational knowledge."<br>
— Albert Einstein<p>

"Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hopes of reward after death. It is therefore easy to see why the churches have always fought science and persecuted its devotees.”<br>
— Albert Einstein, column for The New York Times (Nov. 9, 1930)<p>

"In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast power in the hands of priests. In their labors they will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity itself. This is, to be sure a more difficult but an incomparably more worthy task."<br>
— Albert Einstein, <a href="https://www.update.uu.se/~fbendz/library/ae_scire.htm">"Science, Philosophy and Religion, A Symposium,"</a> 1941<p>

"The minority, the ruling class at present, has the schools and press, usually the Church as well, under its thumb. This enables it to organize and sway the emotions of the masses, and make its tool of them."<br>
— Albert Einstein<p>

"Unthinking respect for authority is the greatest enemy of truth."<br>
— Albert Einstein<p>

"Since our inner experiences consist of reproductions, and combinations of sensory impressions, the concept of a soul without a body seems to me to be empty and devoid of meaning."<br>
— Albert Einstein<p>

"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."<br>
— Albert Einstein<p>

"The most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible."<br>

— Niels Bohr, physicist, to Albert Einstein<p>

“God did it” is simply a synonym for “we don’t know.” That explains nothing.<br>

"Intellectual honesty is a skill that has to be learned and a virtue that has to be practiced; it often requires you to accept unpleasant conclusions."<br>
— John B. Hodges<p>

"If faith is 'believing what you are told', religious ethics is 'doing what you are told'."<br>
— John B. Hodges<p>

"Religion is for people who have never matured in their understanding of ethics. Religion teaches a child's view of ethics, that 'being good' means 'obeying your parent.' It gives a moral blank check to those bold enough, dishonest enough, to claim to speak for God. Atheism means looking at ethical questions as an adult among other adults, considering ethics as a means of maintaining peace and cooperation among equals, so that all may pursue happiness within the limits that ethics defines."<br>
— John B. Hodges<p>

"[Religion is] nothing more than a type of submission to authority."<br>
— Paul Broca<p>

"Christianity preaches only servitude and dependence. Its spirit is so favorable to tyranny that it always profits by such a regime. True Christians are made to be slaves, and they know it and do not much mind: this short life counts for too little in their eyes."<br>
— Jean Jacques Rousseau, <i>The Social Contract</i>, 1762<p>

"Faith is the determination to remain ignorant in the face of all evidence that you are ignorant."<br>
— Shaun Mason<p>

"The invisible and the non-existent look very much alike."<br>
— John Stuart Mill<p>

"A large proportion of the noblest and most valuable teaching has been the work, not only of men who did not know, but of men who knew and rejected the Christian faith."<br>
— John Stuart Mill, <i>On Liberty</i>, 1859<p>

"On the available evidence we have about how the world works, we have to say that we’re alone, there is no God."<br>
— John Searle, interviewed in "Free Inquiry" 1998<p>

"Public prayer is not intended to promote religious values, but to enhance the authority of some churches and some political views over others. Similarly with the posting of the Ten Commandments. It is about power, not about religion. Government by Christian or Islamic or any other faith has rarely been progressive. And the Constitution clearly intends that there should be freedom from religion."<br>
— Ellery Schempp<p>

"Most true believers, when faced with evidence that contradicts their beliefs, will hold on to those beliefs even more strongly."<br>
— Mark Thomas, president and co-founder of <a href=http://www.godlessgeeks.com>Atheists of Silicon Valley</a><p>

"True believers are continually shown by reality that their god doesn't exist, but have developed extensive coping mechanisms to deal with this cognitive dissonance."<br>
— Mark Thomas<p>

"Fundamentalists of different religions have more in common with each other than they do with the moderates of their own religions."<br>
— Mark Thomas<p>

"Christians and Jews don't believe in Allah or Brahma. Hindus don't believe in Yahweh or Allah. Muslims don't believe in Brahma or Yahweh. Atheists agree with all of them."<br>
— Mark Thomas<p>

"The world looks like it was designed. Of course, the Sun also looks like it goes around the Earth. It is only thru science that we know that both of these perceptions are wrong."<br>
— Mark Thomas<p>

"There is little difference in the knowledge held by those who can't learn and those who won't."<br>
— Mark Thomas<p>

"We all behave as though what we think is true, is actually true."<br>
— Mark Thomas<p>

"Believing is easier than thinking; that's why there will always be more believers than thinkers. However, the results of god-belief are often far more mental trials than those of nonbelief. It is quite difficult to ascertain the wishes of an invisible being."<br>
— Mark Thomas<p>

"Christians often threaten atheists with eternal torture. But if we say that they're delusional, they will tell us that we're being rude."<br>
— Mark Thomas<p>

"The essence of Christianity, as I see it, is love. The essence of Humanism (and I'm also a Humanist) is love. At that level, we're not far apart."<br>
— Mark Thomas<p>

"Atheism is nothing more than a conclusion. There are plenty of people in this world who are Atheists, but this doesn't mean we share values. Communism is a perfect example. Communism is for all practical purposes, a political religion: It is totalitarian, it venerates its sainted founders, it has sacred dogma that cannot be challenged; it persecutes its heretics, it does not brook disobedience, it feels no compunction against twisting science for its own means. Even its touted "Atheism" is simply a defensive reaction against its rival religions. It has nothing in common with the free thought of Paine or Jefferson, or the humanism of Dawkins or Einstein."<br>
— David Fitzgerald<p>

"I'm a strong atheist. I believe that gods are by definition supernatural beings, that the supernatural by definition violates natural law, violating natural law is by definition impossible, and impossible things by definition can't exist."<br>
— James Huber<p>

"Morality is doing what is right no matter what you are told. Religion is doing what you are told no matter what is right."<br>
— Larry Mundinger, 1999<p>

— Charles Darwin<p>

"The mystery of the beginning of all things is insoluble by us, and I for one must be content to remain an agnostic."<br>
— Charles Darwin, <i>Life & Letters</i><p>

"Man in his arrogance thinks himself a great work, worthy the interposition of a great deity. More humble and I believe true to consider him created from animals."<br>
— Charles Darwin, <i>Notebooks</i>, 1837<p>

"I can indeed hardly see how anyone ought to wish Christianity to be true; for if so the plain language of the text seems to show that the men who do not believe, and this would include my Father, Brother and almost all my best friends, will be everlastingly punished. And that is a damnable doctrine."<br>
— Charles Darwin, Autobiography<p>

"That there is much suffering in the world no one disputes. Which is more likely, that pain and evil are the result of an all-powerful and good God, or the product of uncaring natural forces? The presence of much suffering agrees well with the view that all organic beings have been developed through variation and natural selection."<br>
— Charles Darwin<p>

"The assumed instinctive belief in God has been used by many persons as an argument for his existence. But this is a rash argument, as we should thus be compelled to believe in the existence of many cruel and malignant spirits, only a little more powerful than man; for the belief in them is far more general than in a beneficent deity."<br>
— Charles Darwin, <i>The Descent of Man</i>, 1871<p>

"There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved."<br>

"It appears to me (whether rightly or wrongly) that direct arguments against Christianity and theism produce hardly any effect on the public; It appears to me freedom of thought is best promoted by the gradual illumination of men’s minds which follow[s] from the advance of science."<br>
— Charles Darwin, 1880<p>

"Science is advanced by proposing and testing hypothesis, not by declaring questions unsolvable."<br>

— Ricky Gervais<p>

"It's always better to tell the truth. The truth doesn't hurt, and saying that, my mother only ever lied to me about one thing. She said there was a God. But that's because when you're a working-class mum, Jesus is like an unpaid babysitter. She thought if I was God-fearing, then I'd be good."<br>

"I believe I have common sense and therefore have no need for religion"<br>
— Heidi Klum<p>

"The most serious demand for unquestioned belief is, of course, the atonement. First the believer is to suspend familiar notions of justice, such as punishment for the guilty as opposed to an innocent party. You are then expected to accept the necessity of blood sacrifice for sin; that wrongdoing must be paid for, and not necessarily in proportion to the crime. A father's sacrifice of his innocent son is supposed to be not only just but generous and wonderful. Then the temporary three-day death of this one person is supposed to wipe out all the wrongdoing and ineptitude of a species. And finally, you should believe that all you need do to erase responsibility for your actions and enter a haven of eternal reward is to believe. It's no wonder that once a convert has wrapped his or her mind around this story, anything can be accepted as truth. The rest of fundamentalist doctrine can be easily swallowed, including Jonah."<br>

"The legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson, <i>Statute for Religious Freedom</i>, saying government has no authority over one's religious opinions, thus defining "crime" as the injury of a person or his property<p>

"Certainly, no power to prescribe any religious exercise, or to assume authority in religious discipline, has been delegated to the General Government."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson, <a href=TJ_NDOP.htm>letter to Samuel Miller</a>, 1/23/1808<p>

"It is error alone which needs the support of government. Truth can stand by itself."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson<p>

"Religions are all alike — founded upon fables and mythologies."<br>

"Christianity is the most perverted system that ever shone on man."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson<p>

"The Christian god is a three headed monster; cruel vengeful and capricious... One only needs to look at the caliber of people who say they serve him. They are always of two classes: fools and hypocrites."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson<p>

— Thomas Jefferson, <i>Notes on Virginia</i>, 1782<p>

"I never submitted the whole system of my opinions to the creed of any party of men whatever in religion, in philosophy, in politics, or in anything else where I was capable of thinking for myself. Such an addiction is the last degradation of a free and moral agent."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson, letter to Francis Hopkinson, 3/13/1789<p>

"Man once surrendering his reason, has no remaining guard against absurdities the most monstrous, and like a ship without rudder, is the sport of every wind. With such persons, gullibility, which they call faith, takes the helm from the hand of reason and the mind becomes a wreck."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson to James Smith, 1822<p>

"It is between fifty and sixty years since I read the Apocalypse, and I then considered it merely the ravings of a maniac."<br>

— Thomas Jefferson<p>

"Shake off all the fears of servile prejudices, under which weak minds are servilely crouched. Fix reason firmly in her seat, and call on her tribunal for every fact, every opinion. Question with boldness even the existence of a God; because, if there be one, he must more approve of the homage of reason than that of blindfolded fear. ...<p>"Do not be frightened from this inquiry by any fear of its consequences. If it ends in a belief that there is no God, you will find inducements to virtue in the comfort and pleasantness you feel in its exercise, and the love of others which it will procure you."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson, letter (written from Paris) to nephew Peter Carr, 1787<p>

"The day will come when the mystical generation of Jesus, by the supreme being as his father in the womb of a virgin, will be classed with the fable of the generation of Minerva in the brain of Jupiter."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson, Letter to John Adams, 1823<p>

"The whole history of these books [the Gospels] is so defective and doubtful that it seems vain to attempt minute enquiry into it; and such tricks have been played with their text, and with the texts of other books relating to them, that we have a right, from that cause, to entertain much doubt what parts of them are genuine. In the New Testament there is internal evidence that parts of it have proceeded from an extraordinary man; and that other parts are of the fabric of very inferior minds. It is as easy to separate those parts, as to pick out diamonds from dunghills."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson, Letter to John Adams (1/24/1814)<p>

"I have ever judged of the religion of others by their lives… But this does not satisfy the priesthood. They must have a positive, a declared assent to all of their interested absurdities. My opinion is that there would never have been an infidel, if there had never been a priest."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson, Letter to Mrs. M. Harrison Smith, 1816<p>

"History, I believe, furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people maintaining a free civil government. This marks the lowest grade of ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will always avail themselves for their own purposes."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson, Letter to Alexander Humboldt, 1813<p>

"Millions of innocent men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined, imprisoned; yet we have not advanced one inch towards uniformity. What has been the effect of coercion? To make one half of the world fools and the other half hypocrites. To support roguery and error all over the world."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson, <i>Notes on the State of Virginia</i>, 1787<p>

"I have recently been examining all the known superstitions of the world, and do not find in our particular superstition (Christianity) one redeeming feature. They are all alike, founded on fables and mythology."<br>

"I do not find in orthodox Christianity one redeeming feature."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson<p>

"On the dogmas of religion, as distinguished from moral principles, all mankind, from the beginning of the world to this day, have been quarreling, fighting, burning and torturing one another, for abstractions unintelligible to themselves and to all others, and absolutely beyond the comprehension of the human mind."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson, letter to Archibald Carey, 1816<p>

"Ridicule is the only weapon which can be used against unintelligible propositions. Ideas must be distinct before reason can act upon them; and no man ever had a distinct idea of the trinity. It is the mere Abracadabra of the mountebanks calling themselves the priests of Jesus."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson, letter to Francis Adrian Van der Kemp, 7/30/1816<p>

You say you are a Calvinist. I am not. I am of a sect by myself, as far as I know."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson, letter to Ezra Stiles Ely, 6/25/1819<p>

"As you say of yourself, I too am an Epicurian. I consider the genuine (not the imputed) doctrines of Epicurus as containing everything rational in moral philosophy which Greece and Rome have left us."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson, letter to William Short, 10/31/1819<p>

"Let us reflect that, having banished from our land that religious intolerance under which mankind so long bled and suffered, we have yet gained little if we countenance a political intolerance as despotic, as wicked, and capable of as bitter and bloody persecutions. Sometimes it is said that man cannot be trusted with the government of himself. Can he, then, be trusted with the government of others? Or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him? Let history answer this question."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson, First Inaugural Address<p>

"No experiment can be more interesting than that we are now trying, and which we trust will end in establishing the fact, that man may be governed by reason and truth."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson, 1804<p>

"To talk of immaterial existences, is to talk of nothings. To say that the human soul, angels, God are immaterial is to say, they are nothings, or that there is no God, no angels, no soul. I cannot reason otherwise: ... I believe I am supported in my creed of materialism by [John] Locke."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson, 8/15/1820<p>

"Believing that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, and not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their Legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus building a wall of separation between Church and State."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson, 3rd U.S. President (1801-1809), letter to Danbury Baptists, 1802<p>

"Religious institutions that use government power in support of themselves and force their views on persons of other faiths, or of no faith, undermine all our civil rights. Moreover, state support of an established religion tends to make the clergy unresponsive to their own people, and leads to corruption within religion itself. Erecting the 'wall of separation between church and state,' therefore, is absolutely essential in a free society."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson<p>

"Every one must act according to the dictates of his own reason, and mine tells me that civil powers alone have been given to the President of the United States, and no authority to direct the religious exercises of his constituents."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson<p>

<a name="washington"></a>
"The United States of America should have a foundation free from the influence of clergy."<br>
— George Washington, 1st U.S. President<p>

"Religious controversies are always productive of more acrimony and irreconcilable hatreds than those which spring from any other cause. I had hoped that liberal and enlightened thought would have reconciled the Christians so that their <i>[NOT our!]</i> religious fights would not endanger the peace of Society."<br>
— George Washington, letter to Sir Edward Newenham, 6/22/1792<p>

"(The) government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistances, requires only that they who live under its protection, should demean themselves as good citizens."<br>
— President George Washington, in a 1790 letter to the Hebrew Congregation of Newport, R.I.<p>

"We have abundant reason to rejoice that in this Land the light of truth and reason has triumphed over the power of bigotry and superstition ... In this enlightened Age and in this Land of equal liberty it is our boast, that a man's religious tenets will not forfeit the protection of the Laws, nor deprive him of the right of attaining and holding the highest Offices that are known in the United States."<br>
— George Washington (1732-1799) 1st U.S. President, quoted from <i>The Great Quotations on Religious Freedom</i><p>

"There is nothing which can better deserve our patronage than the promotion of science and literature. Knowledge is in every country the surest basis of public happiness."<br>
— George Washington<p>

"If I could conceive that the general government might ever be so administered as to render the liberty of conscience insecure, I beg you will be persuaded, that no one would be more zealous than myself to establish effectual barriers against the horrors of spiritual tyranny, and every species of religious persecution."<br>
— George Washington, (Letter to the United Baptist Chamber of Virginia, May 1789)<p>

"As Mankind becomes more liberal, they will be more apt to allow that all those who conduct themselves as worthy members of the community are equally entitled to the protections of civil government. I hope ever to see America among the foremost nations of justice and liberality."<br>
— George Washington<p>

Ashbel Green, a Presbyterian minister who had known George Washington personally, is recorded as having sorrowfully said that "Washington was very deferential to religion and its ceremonies, but like nearly all of the founders of the Republic, he was not a Christian, but a Deist."<p>

George Washington made no mention of God in his will or in his dying words recorded by his personal secretary.<p>

"Gouverneur Morris had often told me that General Washington believed no more of that system (Christianity) than did he himself."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson, in his private journal, Feb. 1800<p>

<a name="franklin"></a>
"They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."<br>
— Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790), from the <i>Historical Review of Pennsylvania</i>, which warns, among other things, that if we don't use the Liberty to hold and express our own religious opinions, even if out of the fear of reprisal, then we rightly forfeit that Liberty<p>

"The [United States Constitutional] Convention, except for three or four persons, thought prayers unnecessary."<br>
— Benjamin Franklin<p>

"Lighthouses are more helpful than churches."<br>
— Benjamin Franklin<p>

"I have found Christian dogma unintelligible. Early in life I absented myself from Christian assemblies."<br>
— Benjamin Franklin, <i>Toward The Mystery</i><p>

"Scarcely was I arrived at fifteen years of age, when, after having doubted in turn of different tenets, according as I found them combated in the different books that I read, I began to doubt of Revelation itself."<br>
— Benjamin Franklin, (Franklin's Autobiography, 1817–18)<p>

"Some volumes against Deism fell into my hands … they produced an effect precisely the reverse to what was intended by the writers; for the arguments of the Deists, which were cited in order to be refuted, appeared to me much more forcibly than the refutation itself; in a word, I soon became a thorough Deist."<br>
— Benjamin Franklin, (ibid.)<p>

"The way to see by Faith is to shut the eye of Reason."<br>
— Benjamin Franklin, <i>Poor Richard</i>, 1758<p>

"Revealed religion has no weight with me."<br>
— Benjamin Franklin<p>

"Indeed, when religious people quarrel about religion, or hungry people quarrel about victuals, it looks as if they had not much of either among them."<br>
— Benjamin Franklin, in <i>Benjamin Franklin — Freethinker</i><p>

"When a religion is good, I conceive it will support itself; and when it does not support itself, and God does not take care to support it so that its professors are obliged to call for help of the civil power, 'tis a sign, I apprehend, of its being a bad one."<br>
— Benjamin Franklin, letter to Richard Price, October 9, 1790<p>

"Do not, however, mistake me. It is not to my good friend's heresy that I impute his honesty. On the contrary, 'tis his honesty that brought upon him the character of a heretic."<br>
— Benjamin Franklin, letter to Benjamin Vaughan, in <i>Works, Vol. X</i>, p.365<p>

"The things of this world take up too much of my time, of which indeed I have too little left, to undertake anything like a reformation in religion."<br>
— Benjamin Franklin, <i>Works, Vol. X'</i>, p. 323<p>

"Religion I found to be without any tendency to inspire, promote, or confirm morality, serves principally to divide us and make us unfriendly to one another."<br>
— Benjamin Franklin<p>

"It is much to be lamented that a man of Franklin's general good character and great influence should have been an unbeliever in Christianity, and also have done as much as he did to make others unbelievers."<br>
— Priestley's <i>Benjamin Franklin Biography</i>, p. 60<p>

<a name="johnadams"></a>
"The divinity of Jesus is made a convenient cover for absurdity. Nowhere in the Gospels do we find a precept for Creeds, Confessions, Oaths, Doctrines, and whole carloads of other foolish trumpery that we find in Christianity."<br>
— <a href=http://johnadamsweb.com/adamsquotes.html>John Adams</a><p>

"The question before the human race is, whether the God of nature shall govern the world by his own laws, or whether priests and kings shall rule it by fictitious miracles?"<br>
— John Adams, letter to Thomas Jefferson<p>

"I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved — the Cross. Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!"<br>
— John Adams, letter to Thomas Jefferson<p>

[In regard to the Trinity] "Tom, had you and I been 40 days with Moses, and beheld the great God, and even if God himself had tried to tell us that three was one ... and one equals three, you and I would never have believed it. We would never fall victims to such lies."<br>
— John Adams, letter to Thomas Jefferson<p>

"Indeed, Mr. Jefferson, what could be invented to debase the ancient Christianism, which Greeks, Romans, Hebrews and Christian factions, above all the Catholics, have not fraudulently imposed upon the public? Miracles after miracles have rolled down in torrents, wave succeeding wave in the Catholic church, from the Council of Nicea, and long before, to this day."<br>
— John Adams, to Jefferson, 12/3/1813<p>

"As I understand the Christian religion, it was, and is, a revelation. But how has it happened that millions of fables, tales, legends, have been blended with both Jewish and Christian revelation that have made them the most bloody religion that ever existed?"<br>
— John Adams, letter to F.A. Van der Kamp, 12/27/1816<p>

"What havoc has been made of books through every century of the Christian era? Where are fifty gospels, condemned as spurious by the bull of Pope Gelasius? Where are the forty wagon-loads of Hebrew manuscripts burned in France, by order of another pope, because suspected of heresy? Remember the 'index expurgatorius', the inquisition, the stake, the axe, the halter and the guillotine."<br>
— John Adams, letter to John Taylor<p>

"The priesthood have, in all ancient nations, nearly monopolized learning. And ever since the Reformation, when or where has existed a Protestant or dissenting sect who would tolerate A Earth? The blackest billingsgate, the most ungentlemanly insolence, the most yahooish brutality, is patiently endured, countenanced, propagated, and applauded. But touch a solemn truth in collision with a dogma of a sect, though capable of the clearest proof, and you will find you have disturbed a nest, and the hornets will swarm about your eyes and hand, and fly into your face and eyes."<br>
— John Adams, ibid.<p>

"This is my religion ... joy and exaltation in my own existence ... so go ahead and snarl ... bite ... howl, you Calvinistic divines and all you who say I am no Christian. I say you are not Christian."<br>
— John Adams, <i>Toward the Mystery</i><p>

"Mystery is a convenient excuse for absurdity."<br>
— John Adams<p>

"The United States of America have exhibited, perhaps, the first example of governments erected on the simple principles of nature; and if men are now sufficiently enlightened to disabuse themselves of artifice, imposture, hypocrisy, and superstition, they will consider this event as an era in their history. Although the detail of the formation of the American governments is at present little known or regarded either in Europe or in America, it may hereafter become an object of curiosity. It will never be pretended that any persons employed in that service had interviews with the gods, or were in any degree under the influence of Heaven, more than those at work upon ships or houses, or laboring in merchandise or agriculture; it will forever be acknowledged that these governments were contrived merely by the use of reason and the senses...."<br>
— John Adams, <i>A Defense of the Constitutions of Government of the United States of America</i><p>

"Nothing is more dreaded than the national government meddling with religion."<br>
— John Adams, letter to Benjamin Rush, 6/12/1812<p>

<a name="madison"></a>
"There is not a shadow of right in the general government to intermingle with religion. Its least interference with it would be a most flagrant usurpation."<br>
— James Madison, Founding Father and author of the First Amendment, 1788<p>

"During almost fifteen centuries has the legal establishment of Christianity been on trial. What has been its fruits? More or less, in all places, pride and indolence in the clergy; ignorance and servility in the laity; in both, superstition, bigotry and persecution."<br>
— James Madison — chief architect of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights<p>

"Who does not see that the same authority, which can establish Christianity, in exclusion of all other Religions, may establish with the same ease any particular sect of Christians, in exclusion of all other Sects?"<br>
— James Madison (1751-1836) 4th U.S. President, "A Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments"<p>

"It degrades from the equal rank of Citizens all those whose opinions in Religion do not bend to those of the Legislative authority. Distant as it may be in its present form from the Inquisition, it differs from it only in degree."<br>
— James Madison<p>

"Religious bondage shackles and debilitates the mind and unfits it for every noble enterprise."<br>
— James Madison, letter to William Bradford, 1771<p>

"Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion and Government in the Constitution of the United States, the danger of encroachment by Ecclesiastical Bodies may be illustrated by precedents already furnished in their short history."<br>
— James Madison, <i>Detached Memoranda</i><p>

"The establishment of the chaplainship to Congress is a palpable violation of ... constitutional principles."<br>
— James Madison, ibid.<p>

"When indeed Religion is kindled into enthusiasm, its force like that of other passions is increased by the sympathy of a multitude. But enthusiasm is only a temporary state of Religion, and whilst it lasts will hardly be seen with pleasure at the helm. Even in its coolest state, it has been much oftener a motive to oppression than a restraint from it."<br>
— James Madison<p>

"A zeal for different opinions concerning religion...[has] divided mankind into parties, inflamed them with mutual animosity, and rendered them much more disposed to vex and oppress each other
 than to co-operate for their common good."<br>
— James Madison, <i>The Federalist Papers</i>, Paper No. 10<p>

"The settled opinion here is that religion is essentially distinct from Civil Govt. and exempt from its cognizance; that a connection between them is injurious to both…."<br>
— James Madison, 1823<p>

"When tyranny and oppression come to this land, it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign foe."<br>
— James Madison<p>

"The civil government … functions with complete success … by the total separation of the Church from the State."<br>

"The world is my country; all mankind are my brethren; and to do good is my religion."<br>

"The study of theology, as it stands in Christian churches, is the study of nothing; it is founded on nothing; it rests on no principles; it proceeds by no authorities; it has no data; it can demonstrate nothing; and it admits of no conclusion."<br>
— Thomas Paine, <i>The Age of Reason</i> (1794)<p>

"I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church."<br>
— Thomas Paine, ibid.<p>

"It is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself. Infidelity does not consist in believing, or in disbelieving; it consists in professing to believe what one does not believe. It is impossible to calculate the moral mischief, if I may so express it, that mental lying has produced in society. When man has so far corrupted and prostituted the chastity of his mind, as to subscribe his professional belief to things he does not believe, he has prepared himself for the commission of every other crime."<br>
— Thomas Paine, ibid.<p>

"The most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall."<br>
— Thomas Paine, ibid.<p>

"Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and tortuous executions, the unrelenting vindictiveness with which more than half the Bible is filled, it would be more consistent that we call it the word of a demon than the word of God. It is a history of wickedness that has served to corrupt and brutalize mankind."<br>
— Thomas Paine, ibid.<p>

"Is it more probable that nature should go out of her course, or that a man should tell a lie? We have never seen, in our time, nature go out of her course; but we have good reason to believe that millions of lies have been told in the same time; it is, therefore, at least millions to one, that the reporter of a miracle tells a lie."<br>
— Thomas Paine, <p>

"Reasoning with one who has abandoned reason is like giving medicine to a dead man."<br>
— Thomas Paine<p>

"The age of ignorance commenced with the Christian system."<br>
— Thomas Paine<p>

"Of all the tyrannies that affect mankind, tyranny in religion is the worst; every other species of tyranny is limited to the world we live in; but this attempts to stride beyond the grave, and seeks to pursue us into eternity."<br>
— Thomas Paine<p>

"I put the following work under your protection. It contains my opinion upon religion. You will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the right of every man to his opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it."<br>
— Thomas Paine<p>

"I detest the Bible as I detest everything that is cruel."<br>
— Thomas Paine<p>

"What is it the Bible teaches us? — raping, cruelty, and murder. What is it the New Testament teaches us? — to believe that the Almighty committed debauchery with a woman engaged to be married, and the belief of this debauchery is called faith."<br>
— Thomas Paine<p>

"And to read the Bible without horror, we must undo everything that is tender, sympathizing and benevolent in the heart of man."<br>
— Thomas Paine<p>

"The prejudice of unfounded belief often degenerates into the prejudice of custom, and becomes at last rank hypocrisy. When men, from custom or fashion or any worldly motive, profess or pretend to believe what they do not believe, nor can give any reason for believing, they unship the helm of their morality, and being no longer honest to their own minds they feel no moral difficulty in being unjust to others."<br>
— Thomas Paine<p>

"I am for liberty of conscience in its noblest, broadest, and highest sense.

"It is not a coincidence that the two fields most commonly accused of being liberal — journalism and academia — are two fields whose central purpose is the pursuit of truth."<br>
— Kenneth Quinnell<p>

"After all, there are crucial distinctions between wanting something to be true, having strong faith in something being true, experiencing it as being true, and it actually being true. Why should anyone suppose that, absent some external independent validation, the experience of being grasped by god is evidence for god?"<br>
— Tom Clark, of <a href=http://www.naturalism.org>Center for Naturalism</a><p>

"Naturalists’ commitment to science ... isn’t a matter of faith, it’s based on experience – the widely shared experience that beliefs about the world based in science are generally more reliable than those that aren’t.

"Free thought means fearless thought. It is not deterred by legal penalties, nor by spiritual consequences. Dissent from the Bible does not alarm the true investigator, who takes truth for authority not authority for truth. The thinker who is really free, is independent; he is under no dread; he yields to no menace; he is not dismayed by law, nor custom, nor pulpits, nor society—whose opinion appals so many. He who has the manly passion of free thought, has no fear of anything, save the fear of error."<br>

"In contradiction to the Bible, the First Amendment to our Constitution gives us the right to worship gods (or not), work on Sunday (or not), and say what we wish about the various gods.

"On the other hand, famous evolutionists such as Dobzhansky were firm believers in a personal God. He would work as a scientist all week and then on Sunday get down on his knees and pray to God.

— Francis Crick<p>

"I find that people seem to think religion brings morals and appreciation of nature. I actually think it detracts from both ... I think we can have morals without getting religion into it, and a lot of bad things have come from organized religion in particular. I actually fear organized religion because it usually leads to misuses of power."<br>

"My practice as a scientist is atheistic. That is to say, when I set up an experiment I assume that no god, angel or devil is going to interfere with its course; and this assumption has been justified by such success as I have achieved in my professional career.

"Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion."<br>
— Steven Weinberg, in <a href=http://www.ffrf.org>"Freethought Today"</a>, April, 2000<p>

"I think enormous harm is done by religion — not just in the name of religion, but actually by religion. ... Many people do simply awful things out of sincere religious belief, not using religion as a cover the way that Saddam Hussein may have done, but really because they believe that this is what God wants them to do, going all the way back to Abraham being willing to sacrifice Isaac because God told him to do that. Putting God ahead of humanity is a terrible thing."<br>

— H.L. Mencken<p>

Mencken's Creed:
<li>I believe that religion, generally speaking, has been a curse to mankind — that its modest and greatly overestimated services on the ethical side have been more than overcome by the damage it has done to clear and honest thinking.
<li>I believe that no discovery of fact, however trivial, can be wholly useless to the race, and that no trumpeting of falsehood, however virtuous in intent, can be anything but vicious.
<li>I believe that all government is evil, in that all government must necessarily make war upon liberty...
<li>I believe that the evidence for immortality is no better than the evidence of witches, and deserves no more respect.
<li>I believe in the complete freedom of thought and speech...
<li>I believe in the capacity of man to conquer his world, and to find out what it is made of, and how it is run.
<li>I believe in the reality of progress.
<li>But the whole thing, after all, may be put very simply. I believe that it is better to tell the truth than to lie.
<li>I believe that it is better to be free than to be a slave. And I believe that it is better to know than be ignorant.<p>

"The theory of natural selection is the centerpiece of <i>The Origin of Species</i> and of evolutionary theory. It is this theory that accounts for the adaptations of organisms, those innumerable features that so wonderfully equip them for survival and reproduction; it is this theory that accounts for the divergence of species from common ancestors and thus for the endless diversity of life.

"People who oppose evolution, and seek to have creationism or intelligent design included in science curricula, seek to dismiss and change the most successful way of knowing ever discovered. They wish to substitute opinion and belief for evidence and testing. The proponents of creationism/intelligent design promote scientific ignorance in the guise of learning. As professional scientists and educators, we strongly assert that such efforts are both misguided and flawed, presenting an incorrect view of science, its understandings, and its processes."<br>

"Those who would legislate against the teaching of evolution should also legislate against gravity, electricity and the unreasonable velocity of light, and also, should introduce a clause to prevent the use of the telescope, the microscope and the spectroscope or any other instrument of precision which may in the future be invented, constructed or used for the discovery of truth."<br>
— Luther Burbank<p>

"Several thousand years ago, a small tribe of ignorant near-savages wrote various collections of myths, wild tales, lies and gibberish. Over the centuries, these stories were embroidered, garbled, mutilated, and torn into small pieces that were then repeatedly shuffled.

"During the Middle Ages there were all kinds of crazy ideas, such as that a piece of rhinoceros horn would increase potency.

"There is nothing wrong with challenging conventional wisdom — continuing challenge is a core feature of science. But challengers should at least be aware of, read, cite, and specifically rebut the actual data that supports conventional wisdom, not merely construct a rhetorical edifice out of omission of relevant facts, selective quoting, bad analogies, knocking down strawmen, and tendentious interpretations.

"The Bible identifies 15 crimes against the family worthy of the death penalty. ABORTION is treason against the family and deserves the DEATH PENALTY. ADULTERY is treason to the family; adulterers should be put to DEATH. HOMOSEXUALITY is treason to the family, and it too, is worthy of DEATH."<br>
— R.J. Rushdoony, to Bill Moyers. In a PBS video: <i>God and Politics: On Earth as it is in Heaven</i>, 1988<p>

R.J. Rushdoony hasn't read his bible much. God doesn't oppose <a href=BibleQuotes.htm#abortion>abortion</a> and he doesn't seem to mind <a href=BibleQuotes.htm#childabuse>child abuse</a>. Concerning adultery, many of the Bible's heroes committed it with God's blessing — such as <a href=BibleQuotes.htm#lust>King David</a>. David was punished for this one but not with the death penalty as Rushdoony suggested.<p>

Concerning the death penalty, there's the following problem: Genesis 9:6 — "Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed, for in the image of God has God made man." <i>Sounds like a bit of a contradiction with all those OT laws.</i><p>

"God himself shows little respect for what is best in the Bible. He commands 'Thou shalt not kill', and then promptly orders the killing of many thousands. Moses condemns human sacrifice but God demands the sacrifice of Isaac and accepts that of Jephthah's daughter.

"The belief in eternal torment, still subscribed to by fundamentalist Christian denominations, undoubtedly ranks as the most vicious and reprehensible doctrine of classical Christianity. It has resulted in an incalculable amount of psychological torture, especially among children where it is employed as a terror tactic to prompt obedience."<br>
— George H. Smith, ibid.<p>

"It cannot be emphasized too strongly that Christianity has a vested interest in human misery. Christianity, perhaps more than any religion before or since, capitalized on human suffering; and it was enormously successful in insuring its own existence through the perpetuation of human suffering."<br>
— George H. Smith, ibid.<p>

"Christianity cannot erase man's need for pleasure, nor can it eradicate the various sources of pleasure. What it can do, however, and what it has been extremely effective in accomplishing, is to inculcate guilt in connection with pleasure. The pursuit of pleasure, when accompanied by guilt, becomes a means of perpetuating chronic guilt, and this serves to reinforce one's dependence on God."<br>
— George H. Smith, ibid.<p>

"Just as Christianity must destroy reason before it can introduce faith, so it must destroy happiness before it can introduce salvation."<br>
— George H. Smith, ibid.<p>

"Reason is not one tool of thought among many, it is the entire toolbox. To advocate that reason be discarded in some circumstances is to advocate that thinking be discarded — which leaves one in the position of attempting to do a job after throwing away the required instrument."<br>
— George H. Smith, ibid.<p>

"I am arguing that faith as such, faith as an alleged method of acquiring knowledge, is totally invalid and as a consequence, all propositions of faith, because they lack rational demonstration, must conflict with reason."<br>
— George H. Smith, ibid.<p>

"All religions are sick men's dreams, false — demonstrably false — and pernicious."<br>

— Mark Mason, <i>The Christian Holocaust</i><p>

"The great conflict of the 21st century will not be between the West and terrorism. Terrorism is a tactic, not a belief. The true battle will be between modern civilization and anti-modernists; between those who believe in the primacy of the individual and those who believe that human beings owe their allegiance and identity to a higher authority; between those who give priority to life in this world and those who believe that human life is mere preparation for an existence beyond life; between those who believe in science, reason, and logic and those who believe that truth is revealed through Scripture and religious dogma. Terrorism will disrupt and destroy lives. But terrorism itself is not the greatest danger we face."<br>

"If God is, man is a slave; now, man can and must be free; then, God does not exist."<br>
— Mikhail Bakunin, ibid.<p>

"All religions, with their gods, their demigods, and their prophets, their messiahs and their saints, were created by the credulous fancy of men who had not attained the full development and full possession of their faculties."<br>

"People go to church for the same reasons they go to a tavern: to stupefy themselves, to forget their misery, to imagine themselves, for a few minutes anyway, free and happy."<br>
— Mikhail Bakunin<p>

"If 'god' is a metaphysical term, then it cannot be even probable that a god exists. For to say that 'God exists' is to make a metaphysical utterance which cannot be either true or false. And by the same criterion, no sentence which purports to describe the nature of a transcendent god can possess any literal significance."<br>
— A.J. Ayer<p>

"I do not believe in God. It seems to me that theists of all kinds have very largely failed to make their concept of a deity intelligible; and to the extent that they have made it intelligible, they have given us no reason to think that anything answers to it."<br>
— A.J. Ayer, "What I Believe," The Humanist, 08/1966, p. 226<p>

"One might be asked 'How can you prove that a god does not exist?' One can only reply that it is scarcely necessary to disprove what has never been proved."<br>
— David A. Spitz (1916-1975)<p>

"If we are honest — and scientists have to be — we must admit that religion is a jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God is a product of the human imagination. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet."<br>
— Paul Dirac, English theoretical physicist, 1902–1984<p>

"Skepticism is the highest duty and blind faith the one unpardonable sin."<br>
— Thomas Henry Huxley, M.D. <i>Essays on Controversial Questions</i>, 1889<p>

"You never see animals going through the absurd and often horrible fooleries of magic and religion. Only man behaves with such gratuitous folly. It is the price he has to pay for being intelligent but not, as yet, quite intelligent enough."<br>
— Aldous Huxley (1894-1963)<p>

"Never have so many been manipulated so much by so few."<br>

"An unexciting truth may be eclipsed by a thrilling falsehood."<br>
— Aldous Huxley, ibid.<p>

"Children are nowhere taught, in any systematic way, to distinguish true from false, or meaningful from meaningless, statements. Why is this so? Because their elders, even in the democratic countries, do not want them to be given this kind of education."<br>

"I call him free who is led solely by reason."<br>
— Baruch Spinoza<p>

"Those who wish to seek out the cause of miracles, and to understand the things of nature as philosophers, and not to stare at them in astonishment like fools, are soon considered heretical and impious, and proclaimed as such by those whom the mob adores as the interpreters of nature and the gods. For these men know that, once ignorance is put aside, that wonderment would be taken away, which is the only means by which their authority is preserved."<br>

— Percy Bysshe Shelley, <i>A Refutation of Deism</i>, 1814<p>

"Christianity indeed has equaled Judaism in the atrocities, and exceeded it in the extent of its desolation. Eleven millions of men, women, and children have been killed in battle, butchered in their sleep, burned to death at public festivals of sacrifice, poisoned, tortured, assassinated, and pillaged in the spirit of the Religion of Peace, and for the glory of the most merciful God."<br>

"The division between faith and reason is a half-measure, till it is frankly admitted that faith has to do with fiction, and reason with fact."<br>
— Sir Leslie Stephen, <i>Essays on Freethinking and Plainspeaking</i><p>

"Freethinkers are those who are willing to use their minds without prejudice and without fearing to understand things that clash with their own customs, privileges, or beliefs. This state of mind is not common, but it is essential for right thinking; where it is absent, discussion is apt to become worse than useless."<br>

"There is no justification for the common claim that Christianity was responsible for the abolition of slavery. The Negro slave trade – a far more infamous practice than slavery in the ancient world – was initiated, carried on and defended by Christian men in Christian countries."<br>

"The Christian religion is so manifestly contrary to the facts, belief in it can only be held with the most delusional gerrymandering imaginable."<br>

"The dominant Catholic Church jumped through legalistic hoops to make slavery not only acceptable but justifiable as a way of spreading the faith. Indeed, slave owners were obliged by law to baptize their slaves."<br>
— Phil Grabsky, author – <i>An Inconvenient History</i>, BBC<p>

"It is a terrible commentary on Christian civilization that the longest period of slave-raiding known to history was initiated by the action of Spain, Portugal, France, Holland and Britain, after the Christian faith had for more than a thousand years been the established religion of Europe."<br>
— H.A.L. Fisher, <i>History of Europe</i><p>

"Let's not forget that the first holocaust took place not in the concentration camps of Nazi Germany, or Poland, but on the cotton fields of Christian America, the gold mines of Catholic Brazil, and the sugar plantations of the Caribbean. One and a half million negroes died in transit from their homeland. We don't know how many were worked, whipped, tortured, hanged or beaten to death but the ultimate toll was considerably greater than the combined toll in Auswitz, Belsen and the like. We're talking about the Christian holocaust."<br>

"If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him; let us worship God through Jesus if we must — if ignorance has so far prevailed that this name can still be spoken in all seriousness without being taken as a synonym for rapine and carnage.

— Mark Twain<p>

"Man is a marvelous curiosity... he thinks he is the Creator's pet... he even believes the Creator loves him; has a passion for him; sits up nights to admire him; yes and watch over him and keep him out of trouble. He prays to Him and thinks He listens. Isn't it a quaint idea."<br>

"In God We Trust. It is the choicest compliment that has ever been paid us, and the most gratifying to our feelings. It is simple, direct, gracefully phrased; it always sounds well — In God We Trust. I don't believe it would sound any better if it were true."<br>
— Mark Twain<p>

"If Christ were here there is one thing he would not be — a Christian."<br>
— Mark Twain<p>

"The so-called Christian nations are the most enlightened and progressive ... but in spite of their religion, not because of it. The Church has opposed every innovation and discovery from the day of Galileo down to our own time, when the use of anesthetic in childbirth was regarded as a sin because it avoided the biblical curse pronounced against Eve. And every step in astronomy and geology ever taken has been opposed by bigotry and superstition. The Greeks surpassed us in artistic culture and in architecture five hundred years before Christian religion was born."<br>
— Mark Twain<p>

"There is one notable thing about our Christianity: bad, bloody, merciless, money-grabbing and predatory as it is — in our country particularly, and in all other Christian countries in a somewhat modified degree — it is still a hundred times better than the Christianity of the Bible, with its prodigious crime — the invention of Hell. Measured by our Christianity of to-day, bad as it is, hypocritical as it is, empty and hollow as it is, neither the Deity nor His Son is a Christian, nor qualified for that moderately high place. Ours is a terrible religion. The fleets of the world could swim in spacious comfort in the innocent blood it has spilt."<br>

— Mark Twain, <i>Following the Equator</i><p>

"Strange a God who mouths Golden Rules and forgiveness, then invented hell; who mouths morals to other people and has none Himself; who frowns upon crimes yet commits them all; who created man without invitation, then tries to shuffle the responsibility for man's acts upon man, instead of honorably placing it where it belongs, upon Himself; and finally with altogether divine obtuseness, invites this poor, abused slave to worship Him!"<br>

"History does not record anywhere a religion that has any rational basis. Religion is a crutch for people not strong enough to stand up to the unknown without help."<br>
— Robert Heinlein, ibid.<p>

"The most preposterous notion that H. sapiens has ever dreamed up is that the Lord God of Creation, Shaper and Ruler of all the Universes, wants the saccharine adoration of His creatures, can be swayed by their prayers, and becomes petulant if He does not receive this flattery. Yet this absurd fantasy, without a shred of evidence to bolster it, pays all the expenses of the oldest, largest, and least productive industry in all history."<br>
— Robert Heinlein, ibid.<p>

"God is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent — it says so right here on the label. If you have a mind capable of believing all three of these attributes simultaneously, I have a wonderful bargain for you. No checks, please. Cash and in small bills."<br>

<a href=http://atheism.about.com/library/quotes/bl_q_RHeinlein.htm>Here are more Heinlein quotes.</a><p>

"We may define "faith" as the firm belief in something for which there is no evidence. Where there is evidence, no one speaks of "faith." We do not speak of faith that two and two are four or that the earth is round. We only speak of faith when we wish to substitute emotion for evidence. The substitution of emotion for evidence is apt to lead to strife, since different groups, substitute different emotions."<br>
— Bertrand Russell (1872-1970)<p>

"When two men of science disagree, they do not invoke the secular arm; they wait for further evidence to decide the issue, because, as men of science, they know that neither is infallible. But when two theologians differ, since there is no criteria to which either can appeal, there is nothing for it but mutual hatred and an open or covert appeal to force."<br>
— Bertrand Russell<p>

"My conclusion is that there is no reason to believe any of the dogmas of traditional theology and, further, that there is no reason to wish that they were true. Man, in so far as he is not subject to natural forces, is free to work out his own destiny. The responsibility is his, and so is the opportunity."<br>

"I believe that when I die I shall rot, and nothing of my ego will survive. I am not young, and I love life. But I should scorn to shiver with terror at the thought of annihilation. Happiness is nonetheless true happiness because it must come to an end, nor do thought and love lose their value because they are not everlasting."<br>
— Bertrand Russell, "What I Believe", 1925<p>

"You find as you look around the world that every single bit of progress in humane feeling, every improvement in the criminal law, every step toward the diminution of war, every step toward better treatment of the colored races, or every mitigation of slavery, every moral progress that there has been in the world, has been consistently opposed by the organized churches of the world. I say quite deliberately that the Christian religion, as organized in its churches, has been and still is the principal enemy of moral progress in the world."<br>

"[There has been] every kind of cruelty practiced upon all sorts of people in the name of religion."<br>

— Bertrand Russell<p>

"The infliction of cruelty with a good conscience is a delight to moralists — that is why they invented hell."<br>
— Bertrand Russell<p>

"Religion is based ... mainly upon fear ... fear of the mysterious, fear of defeat, fear of death. Fear is the parent of cruelty, and therefore it is no wonder if cruelty and religion have gone hand in hand. My own view on religion is that of Lucretius. I regard it as a disease born of fear and as a source of untold misery to the human race."<br>

"Never try to discourage thinking, for you are sure to succeed."<br>

"There is something feeble and a little contemptible about a man who cannot face the perils of life without the help of comfortable myths. Almost inevitably some part of him is aware that they are myths and that he believes them only because they are comforting. But he dare not face this thought! Moreover, since he is aware, however dimly, that his opinions are not rational, he becomes furious when they are disputed."<br>

"It was while I was studying philosophy that I came to understand ... that it is no sign of moral or spiritual strength to believe that for which one has no evidence, neither a priori evidence as in math, nor a posteriori evidence as in science. ... It's a violation almost immoral in its transgressiveness to shirk the responsibilities of rationality."<br>
— Rebecca Newberger Goldstein<p>

"Religions are like glow-worms. They need darkness in order to shine."<br>
— Arthur Schopenhauer, philosopher<p>

"If we go back to the beginning we shall find that ignorance and fear created the gods; that fancy, enthusiasm, or deceit adorned or disfigured them; that weakness worships them; that credulity preserves them, and that custom, respect and tyranny support them in order to make the blindness of men serve its own interests. If ignorance of Nature gave birth to gods, then knowledge of Nature is calculated to destroy them."<br>

"[T]he Court has unambiguously concluded that the individual freedom of conscience protected by the First Amendment embraces the right to select any religious faith or none at all. This conclusion derives support ... from recognition of the fact that the political interest in forestalling intolerance extends beyond intolerance among Christian sects — or even intolerance among 'religions' — to encompass intolerance of the disbeliever and the uncertain."<br>

"The mixing of government and religion can be a threat to free government, even if no one is forced to participate.... When the government puts its imprimatur on a particular religion, it conveys a message of exclusion to all those who do not adhere to the favored beliefs. A government cannot be premised on the belief that all persons are created equal when it asserts that God prefers some."<br>
— Harry Andrew Blackmun, U.S. Supreme Court Justice, majority opinion in Lee v. Weisman, 1992<p>

"We repeat and again reaffirm that neither a State nor the Federal Government can constitutionally force a person 'to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion.'

"The lessons of the First Amendment are as urgent in the modern world as the 18th Century when it was written.

— Anthony Kennedy, Supreme Court Justice, quoted from "The Case Against School Prayer," a <a href=http://www.ffrf.org>Freedom From Religion Foundation</a> pamphlet<p>

"The Ten Commandments are undeniably a sacred text in the Jewish and Christian faiths, and no legislative recitation of a supposed secular purpose can blind us to that fact ... the first part of the Commandments concerns the religious duties of believers: worshipping the Lord God alone, avoiding idolatry, not using the Lord's name in vain, and observing the Sabbath day."<br>

"For the genius of the Constitution rests not in any static meaning it might have had in a world that is dead and gone, but in the adaptibility of its great principles to cope with current problems and current needs. If we are to be as a shining city upon a hill, it will be because of our ceaseless pursuit of the constitutional ideal of human dignity."<br>
— William Brennan, U.S. Supreme Court Justice, 1985<p>

"... from the standpoint of freedom of speech and the press, it is enough to point out that the state has no legitimate interest in protecting any or all religions from views distasteful to them which is sufficient to justify prior restraints upon the expression of those views. It is not the business of government in our nation to suppress real or imagined attacks upon a particular religious doctrine ..."<br>

"In 1850, I believe, the church property in the United States, which paid no tax, amounted to $87 million. In 1900, without a check, it is safe to say, this property will reach a sum exceeding $3 billion. I would suggest the taxation of all property equally."<br>

Resolve that neither the state nor nation, nor both combined, shall support institutions of learning other than those sufficient to afford every child growing up in the land of opportunity of a good common school education, unmixed with sectarian, pagan, or Atheistical dogmas. Leave the matter of religion to the family altar, the church and the private school supported entirely by private contributions. Keep the church and state forever separate."<br>

"The United States is no more a Christian nation because most of its citizens are Christians than it is a 'white' nation because most of its citizens are white.

— Rev. Billy Graham, Parade, 1981, in <i>The Great Quotations on Religious Freedom</i><p>

"Being a conservative in America traditionally has meant that one holds a deep, abiding respect for the Constitution. We conservatives believe sincerely in the integrity of the Constitution. We treasure the freedom that document protects.... By maintaining the separation of church and state, the United States has avoided the intolerance, which has so divided the rest of the world with religious wars. Throughout our two hundred plus years, public policy debate has focused on political and economic issues, on which there can be compromise.... The great decisions of government cannot be dictated by the concerns of religious factions. This was true in the days of Madison, and it is just as true today. We have succeeded for 205 years in keeping the affairs of state separate from the uncompromising idealism of religious groups and we mustn't stop now. To retreat from that separation would violate the principles of conservatism and the values upon which the framers built this democratic republic."<br>
— Barry Goldwater (1909-1998) Rep. Senator from Arizona. 1981 U.S. Senate Address, in <i>The Great Quotations on Religious Freedom</i><p>

— Barry Goldwater<p>

"There is no position on which people are so immovable as their religious beliefs. There is no more powerful ally one can claim in a debate than Jesus Christ, or God, or Allah, or whatever one calls this supreme being. The religious factions that are growing throughout our land are not using their religious clout with wisdom. They are trying to force government leaders into following their position 100 percent. If you disagree with these religious groups on a particular moral issue, they complain, they threaten you with a loss of money or votes or both. I'm frankly sick and tired of the political preachers across this country telling me ... that if I want to be a moral person, I must believe in A, B, C, and D. Just who do they think they are?"<br>
— Senator Barry Goldwater, Congressional Record, 1981<p>

"Politics and governing demand compromise. But these Christians believe they are acting in the name of God, so they can't and won't compromise. I know; I've tried to deal with them. Just who do they think they are? And from where do they presume to claim the right to dictate their moral beliefs to me? And I am even more angry as a legislator who must endure the threats of every religious group who thinks it has some God-granted right to control my vote on every roll call in the Senate. I am warning them today: I will fight them every step of the way if they try to dictate their moral convictions to all Americans in the name of ‘conservatism.’"<br>

"Whenever a man believes that he has the exact truth from God, there is in that man no spirit of compromise. He has not the modesty born of the imperfections of human nature; he has the arrogance of theological certainty and the tyranny born of ignorant assurance. Believing himself to be the slave of God, he imitates his master, and of all tyrants the worst is a slave in power."<br>
— Robert G. Ingersoll<p>

"It is contended by many that ours is a Christian government, founded upon the Bible, and that all who look upon the book as false or foolish are destroying the foundation of our country. The truth is, our government is not founded upon the rights of gods, but upon the rights of men. Our Constitution was framed, not to declare and uphold the deity of Christ, but the sacredness of humanity. Ours is the first government made by the people and for the people. It is the only nation with which the gods have had nothing to do. And yet there are some judges dishonest and cowardly enough to solemnly decide that this is a Christian country, and that our free institutions are based upon the infamous laws of Jehovah."<br>
— Robert G. Ingersoll, <i>Individuality</i>, 1873<p>

"When I became convinced that the universe is natural, that all the ghosts and gods are myths, there entered into my brain, into my soul, into every drop of my blood the sense, the feeling, the joy of freedom. The walls of my prison crumbled and fell. The dungeon was flooded with light and all the bolts and bars and manacles became dust. I was no longer a servant, a serf, or a slave. There was for me no master in all the wide world, not even in infinite space. I was free — free to think, to express my thoughts — free to live my own ideal, free to live for myself and those I loved, free to use all my faculties, all my senses, free to spread imagination's wings, free to investigate, to guess and dream and hope, free to judge and determine for myself ... I was free! I stood erect and fearlessly, joyously faced all worlds."<br>
— Robert G. Ingersoll, 1896<p>

"For ages, a deadly conflict has been waged between a few brave men and women of thought and genius upon the one side, and the great ignorant religious mass on the other. This is the war between Science and Faith.<br>"The few have appealed to reason, to honor, to law, to freedom, to the known, and to happiness here in this world. The many have appealed to prejudice, to fear, to miracle, to slavery, to the unknown, and to misery hereafter.<br>"The few have said, Think! The many have said, Believe!

"All that is necessary, as it seems to me, to convince any reasonable person that the Bible is simply and purely of human invention — of barbarian invention — is to read it. Read it as you would any other book; think of it as you would of any other; get the bandage of reverence from your eyes; drive from your heart the phantom of fear; push from the throne of your brain the cowled form of superstition — then read the Holy Bible, and you will be amazed that you ever, for one moment, supposed a being of infinite wisdom, goodness and purity, to be the author of such ignorance and of such atrocity."<br>

"Theology asserts propositions that cannot be proven true; ideologues hold stoutly to a worldview despite being contradicted by what is generally accepted as reality. When ideology and theology couple, their offspring are not always bad but they are always blind. And there is the danger: voters and politicians alike, oblivious to the facts."<br>
— Bill Moyers<p>

"The virgin birth, understood as literal biology, makes Christ's divinity, as traditionally understood, impossible."<br>

"The miracle stories of the New Testament can no longer be interpreted in a post-Newtonian world as supernatural events performed by an incarnate deity."<br>
— Bishop John Shelby Spong<p>

"The view of the cross as the sacrifice for the sins of the world is a barbarian idea based on primitive concepts of God and must be dismissed."<br>
— Bishop John Shelby Spong<p>

"Prayer cannot be a request made to a theistic deity to act in human history in a particular way."<br>
— Bishop John Shelby Spong<p>

"The hope for life after death must be separated forever from the behavior control mentality of reward and punishment. The Church must abandon, therefore, its reliance on guilt as a motivator of behavior."<br>
— Bishop John Shelby Spong<p>

"If the resurrection of Jesus cannot be believed except by assenting to the fantastic descriptions included in the Gospels, then Christianity is doomed. For that view of resurrection is not believable, and if that is all there is, then Christianity, which depends upon the truth and authenticity of Jesus' resurrection, also is not believable."<br>
— Bishop John Shelby Spong, <i>Resurrection: Myth or Reality?</i> p. 238<p>

"Jesus is a mythical figure in the tradition of pagan mythology and almost nothing in all of ancient literature would lead one to believe otherwise. Anyone wanting to believe Jesus lived and walked as a real live human being must do so despite the evidence, not because of it."<br>
— C. Dennis McKinsey, <i><a href=http://www.apocalipsis.org/difficulties/ebe.htm>Encyclopedia of Biblical Errancy</a></i><p>

"I think the fault is more with historicists who have stubbornly failed to develop a good theory of historicity. By simply resting on the feeble laurels of prima facie plausibility ('Jesus existed because everyone said so') and subjective notions of absurdity ('I can't believe Jesus didn't exist!'), the existence of Jesus has largely been taken for granted, even by competent historians who explicitly try to argue for it."<br>
— Earl Doherty, <i>The Jesus Puzzle</i><p>

"The Gospel story, with its figure of Jesus of Nazareth, cannot be found before the Gospels. In Christian writings earlier than Mark, including almost all of the New Testament epistles, as well as in many writings from the second century, the object of Christian faith is never spoken of as a human man who had recently lived, taught, performed miracles, suffered and died at the hands of human authorities, or rose from a tomb outside Jerusalem. There is no sign in the epistles of Mary or Joseph, Judas or John the Baptist, no birth story, teaching or appointment of apostles by Jesus, no mention of holy places or sites of Jesus’ career, not even the hill of Calvary or the empty tomb. This silence is so pervasive and so perplexing that attempted explanations for it have proven inadequate."<br>
— Earl Doherty, ibid.<p>

"The general root of superstition is that men observe when things hit, and not when they miss, and commit to memory the one, and pass over the other."<br>
— Francis Bacon, in <i>2000 Years of Disbelief</i> by James A. Haught<p>

"Atheism leaves a man to sense, to philosophy, to natural piety, to laws, to reputation; all of which may be guides to an outward moral virtue, even if religion vanished; but religious superstition dismounts all these and erects an absolute monarchy in the minds of men."<br>

— St. Paul, Romans 2:1<p>

"Today, almost half a century after the publication of the Encyclical [of Pius IX], new knowledge has led to the recognition in the theory of evolution of more than a hypothesis. It is indeed remarkable that this theory has been progressively accepted by researchers, following a series of discoveries in various fields of knowledge. The convergence, neither sought nor fabricated, of the results of work that was conducted independently is in itself a significant argument in favor of this theory."<br>
— Pope John Paul II, revising Pius IX's Encyclical, Address to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, 10/28/1986, quoted from <i>Has Science Found God?</i> (2001)<p>

"The problem with intelligent-design theory, is not that it is false but that it is not falsifiable. Not being susceptible to contradicting evidence, it is not a testable hypothesis. Hence it is not a scientific but a creedal tenet — a matter of faith, unsuited to a public school's science curriculum."<br>
— George Will<p>

"In India, as elsewhere in our darkening world, religion is the poison in the blood. Where religion intervenes, mere innocence is no excuse. Yet we go on skating around this issue, speaking of religion in the fashionable language of 'respect.' What is there to respect in any of this, or in any of the crimes now being committed almost daily around the world in religion's dreaded name?"<br>
— Salman Rushdie<p>

"Respect for religion has become a code phrase meaning fear of religion. Religions, like all other ideas, deserve criticism, satire, and, yes, our feaarless disrepect."<br>
— Salman Rushdie, author<p>

"If you think you've got an inside track to absolute truth, you become doctrinaire, humorless and intellectually constipated. The greatest crimes in history have been perpetrated by such religious and political and racial fanatics."

"When you once attribute effects to the will of a personal God, you have let in a lot of little gods and evils — then sprites, fairies, dryads, naiads, witches, ghosts and goblins, for your imagination is reeling, riotous, drunk, afloat on the flotsam of superstition. What you know then doesn't count. You just believe, and the more your believe the more do you plume yourself that fear and faith are superior to science and seeing."<br>
— Elbert Hubbard, lecturer, author, printer<p>

"I believe in an America where religious intolerance will someday end ... where every man has the same right to attend or not attend the church of his choice."<br>
— John F. Kennedy (1917-1963) 35th U.S. President, address to the Ministerial Association of Greater Houston, 1960<p>

"I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute — where no Catholic prelate would tell the president (should he be Catholic) how to act, and no Protestant minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote — where no church or church school is granted any public funds or political preference — and where no man is denied public office merely because his religion differs from the president who might appoint him or the people who might elect him.<br>
"I believe in an America that is officially neither Catholic, Protestant nor Jewish — where no public official either requests or accepts instructions on public policy from the pope, the National Council of Churches or any other ecclesiastical source — where no religious body seeks to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of its officials."<br>
— John F. Kennedy, ibid.<p>

"I can't take my Catholic belief, my article of faith, and legislate it on a Protestant or a Jew or an Atheist. We have separation of church and state in the United States of America."<br>

"People who believe they are acting with the mandate of God, who see others who don't share their beliefs as inferior in the eyes of God, make dangerous leaders. Just ask Osama Bin Laden."<br>
— Ron Reagan, son of President Ronald Reagan<p>

"I find that most deism, and certainly most theisms take a fairly narrow view of the universe, and most people’s views of God or gods seem to be rather impoverished. The universe itself, the physical world that we can perceive with our senses and grasp with our minds, seems to be far more wondrous than most people's conceptions of a deity."<br>
— Ron Reagan<p>

"We in the United States, above all, must remember that lesson, for we were founded as a nation of openness to people of all beliefs. And so we must remain. Our very unity has been strengthened by our pluralism. We establish no religion in this country, we command no worship, we mandate no belief, nor will we ever. Church and state are, and must remain, separate. All are free to believe or not believe, all are free to practice a faith or not, and those who believe are free, and should be free, to speak of and act on their belief."<br>
— President Ronald Reagan, during the 1984 presidential campaign<p>

"The Founding Fathers were neither passive, death-worshiping mystics nor mindless, power-seeking looters; as a political group, they were a phenomenon unprecedented in history: they were thinkers who were also men of action. They had rejected the soul-body dichotomy, with its two corollaries: the impotence of man's mind and the damnation of this earth; they had rejected the doctrine of suffering as man's metaphysical fate, they proclaimed man's right to the pursuit of happiness and were determined to establish on earth the conditions required for man's proper existence, by the 'unaided' power of their intellect."<br>
— Ayn Rand (1905-1982) American novelist and philosopher, <i>For the New Intellectual</i><p>

— Katharine Hepburn, <i>Banned Books – Quotes</i><p>

"In view of the tide of religiosity engulfing a once secular republic, it is refreshing to be reminded by Freethinkers that free thought and skepticism are robustly in the American tradition. After all, the Founding Fathers began by omitting God from the American Constitution."<br>
— Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.<p>

"As a historian, I confess to a certain amusement when I hear the Judeo-Christian tradition praised as the source of our concern for human rights. In fact, the great religious ages were notable for their indifference to human rights in the contemporary sense. They were notorious not only for acquiescence in poverty, inequality, exploitation and oppression but for enthusiastic justifications of slavery, persecution, abandonment of small children, torture, genocide."<br>

— Gloria Steinem, (1934-) American writer and political activist, quoted in <i>Breaking the Last Taboo</i>, 1996<p>

— Gloria Steinem<p>

"When I got untethered from the comfort of religion, it wasn't a loss of faith for me. It was a discovery of self. I had thought that I'm capable enough to handle any situation. There's peace in understanding that I have only one life, here and now, and I'm responsible."<br>
— Brad Pitt<p>

"I don't think any religion makes any sense and I think people who are into that are really getting duped, and I don't think Judaism makes any more sense than Christianity, and I don't think Christianity makes any more sense than Scientology. But here's a guy, L. Ron Hubbard, who told all his friends, 'Look, I'm gonna start a religion, 'cause I can't make any money as a science fiction writer.' I mean, he admitted that publicly! At least with Jesus Christ, you can't go talk to the guy."<br>

— Jae Marston<p>

"We have gone a long way toward civilization and religious tolerance, and we have a good example in this country. Here the many Protestant denominations, the Catholic Church and the Greek Orthodox Church do not seek to destroy one another in physical violence just because they do not interpret every verse of the Bible in exactly the same way. Here we now have the freedom of all religions, and I hope that never again will we have a repetition of religious bigotry, as we have had in certain periods of our own history. There is no room for that kind of foolishness here."<br>

"You know what an agnostic is, don't you? A cowardly atheist. And I'm an agnostic. ... You asked about the afterlife. Well, I can't take bets on it. Who's going to take my bet, you know?

— Studs Terkel, Interview with Krista Tippett on "Speaking of Faith," American Public Media, 2004<p>

"So I'm sorry, I don't respect people who believe in religion. I was religious when I was a kid. We all had dumb stuff drilled into our head. It doesn't mean when you get to be an adult you can't drill it out. I tell you something else they drilled into my head when I was a kid, mercury in my cavities. We found out later mercury is so bad we shouldn't even eat it when there is a trace of it in fish. But it was drilled into my teeth. So when I got older, I had it drilled out. You can do the same thing with religion. To talk about this terrorism situation without talking about religion is like talking about AIDS in America without talking about homosexuality. You can do it; it will get you applause on Oprah; but it's not true."<br>

"Religion is dangerous because it allows human beings who don't have all the answers, to think that they do."<br>
— Bill Maher, ibid.<p>

"Rational people, anti-religionists, must end their timidity and come out of the closet and assert themselves. And those who consider themselves only moderately religious really need to look in the mirror and realize that the solace and comfort that religion brings you actually comes at a terrible price."<br>
— Bill Maher, ibid.<p>

"If you belonged to a political party or a social club that was tied to as much bigotry, misogyny, homophobia, violence, and sheer ignorance as religion is, you'd resign in protest.

"When I hear from people that religion doesn't hurt anything, I say, really? Well besides wars, the Crusades, the Inquisitions, 9-11, ethnic cleansing, the suppression of women, the suppression of homosexuals, fatwas, honor killings, suicide bombings, arranged marriages to minors, human sacrifice, burning witches, and systematic sex with children, I have a few little quibbles. And I forgot blowing up girls' schools in Afghanistan."<br>

"I am prejudiced against religion because I know the history of religion, and it is the history of human misery and of black crimes."<br>
— Isaac Asimov<p>

"[I]f I were not an atheist, I would believe in a God who would choose to save people on the basis of the totality of their lives and not the pattern of their words. I think he would prefer an honest and righteous atheist to a TV preacher whose every word is God, God, God, and whose every deed is foul, foul, foul."<br>

"To surrender to ignorance and call it God has always been premature, and it remains premature today."<br>
— Isaac Asimov<p>

"There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that ‘my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.’"<br>

"The Bible and the Church have been the greatest stumbling blocks in the way of women's emancipation."<br>

— Elizabeth Cady Stanton<p>

"They said God was on high and he controlled the world and therefore we must pray against Satan. Well, if God controls the world, he cpntrols Satan.
For me, religion was full of misstatements and reaches of logic that I just couldn't agree with."<br>

"Religions survive mainly because they brainwash the young."<br>
— A.C. Grayling<p>

Inculcating the various competing — competing, note — falsehoods of the major faiths into small children is a form of child abuse, and a scandal."<br>
— A.C. Grayling<p>

"Let us challenge religion to leave children alone until they are adults, whereupon they can be presented with the essentials of religion for mature consideration. For example: tell an averagely intelligent adult hitherto free of religious brainwashing that somewhere, invisibly, there is a being somewhat like us, with desires, interests, purposes, memories, and emotions of anger, love, vengefulness, and jealousy, yet with the negation of such other of our failings as mortality, weakness, corporeality, visibility, limited knowledge and insight; and that this god magically impregnates a mortal woman, who then gives birth to a special being who performs various prodigious feats before departing for heaven. Take your pick of which version of this story to tell: let a King of Heaven impregnate — let's see — Danae or Io or Leda or the Virgin Mary (etc., etc.) and let there be resulting heaven-destined progeny (Heracles, Castor and Pollux, Jesus, etc., etc.) — or any of the other forms of exactly such tales in Babylonian, Egyptian, and other mythologies — then ask which of them he wishes to believe. One can guarantee that such a person would say: none of them."<br>
— A.C. Grayling<p>

"I most emphatically think that the world would be a far, far better place without religion. There are various reasons why conflicts arise between people, but the single greatest one is religion: and given that religions are antique sets of superstitions and non-rational beliefs, it is a tragedy of the first order that they still cause such immense suffering and difficulty in the world."<br>
— A.C. Grayling<p>

"What do you think science is? There's nothing magical about science. It is simply a systematic way for carefully and thoroughly observing nature and using consistent logic to evaluate results. Which part of that exactly do you disagree with? Do you disagree with being thorough? Using careful observation? Being systematic? Or using consistent logic?"<br>
— Dr. Steven Novella<p>

"Questioning our own motives, and our own process, is critical to a skeptical and scientific outlook. We must realize that the default mode of human psychology is to grab onto comforting beliefs for purely emotional reasons, and then justify those beliefs to ourselves with post-hoc rationalizations."<br>
— Dr. Steven Novella<p>

"Creationists argue that natural selection is only a negative process, and therefore cannot create anything. Chopra argues that skepticism is only a negative process, and therefore does not lead to knowledge. Both are wrong for the same reasons. They ignore the generation of diversity and new ideas upon which natural selection and skepticism act. Weeding out the unfit is critical to both – natural selection allows evolution to proceed, and skepticism allows science to advance."<br>
— Dr. Steven Novella<p>

"Needless to say, since the income of the priest class is totally dependent on their continued ability to sell invisible goods to suckers, they praise and glorify faith to the skies, complimenting people on how much of it sthey have. If it weren't for faith, they'd be out of business, and they know it."<br>
— Richard Russell<p>

"Popular religion is a coping mechanism for the anxieties of a dysfunctional social and economic environment."<br>

Chronic Dependence of Popular Religiosity upon Dysfunctional Psychosociological Conditions"</a><p>

"Materialism is the worldview or term describing application of reason, science and the human experience in understanding the world around us and in making decisions or living our day-to-day lives, as opposed to faith, dogma, prayer or superstition, etc. As materialists we conclude there is no god or higher power and we therefore declare ourselves to be atheists or people who live without theism or religion. Modern materialism is rooted in the work of the pre-Socratic Greek philosopher Democritus (460-370 BCE), who is also known as the Father of Atomic Science. Antonyms to materialism are spiritualism or immaterialism; the worldview of materialism is not to be confused with consumerism. Atheism is a conclusion, not a religion or ideology."<br>

"Don't compromise yourself. You're all you've got."<br>

"We could call order by the name of God, but it would be an impersonal God. There's not much personal about the laws of physics."<br>
— Stephen Hawking, Reason magazine, April 2002<p>

"What I have done is to show that it is possible for the way the universe began to be determined by the laws of science. In that case, it would not be necessary to appeal to God to decide how the universe began. This doesn't prove that there is no God, only that God is not necessary."<br>
— Stephen Hawking, Der Spiegel, 1989<p>

"One does not have to appeal to God to set the initial conditions for the creation of the universe, but if one does He would have to act through the laws of physics."<br>
— Stephen Hawking, <i>Black Holes & Baby Universes</i><p>

"As recent advances in cosmology suggest, the laws of gravity and quantum theory allow universes to appear spontaneously from nothing. Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist. It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going."<br>

"In the Bullshit Department, a businessman can't hold a candle to a clergyman. 'Cause I gotta tell you the truth, folks. When it comes to bullshit, big-time, major league bullshit, you have to stand in awe of the all-time champion of false promises and exaggerated claims: Religion. No contest. No contest. Religion. Religion easily has the greatest bullshit story ever told.<p>"Think about it. Religion has actually convinced people that there's an invisible man — living in the sky — who watches everything you do, every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do. And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place, full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever 'til the end of time!<p>
"But He loves you.<p>"He loves you, and He needs money! He always needs money! He's all-powerful, all-perfect, all-knowing, and all-wise, somehow just can't handle money! Religion takes in billions of dollars, they pay no taxes, and they always need a little more. Now, you talk about a good bullshit story. Holy Shit!"<br>
