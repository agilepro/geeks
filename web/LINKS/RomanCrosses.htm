<h2>Did the Romans use Crosses for Execution?</h2>
<br>
by John B. Hodges<p>

A serious historical challenge comes from Dan Barker, former Christian
evangelist turned atheist, in his book LOSING FAITH IN FAITH. In chapter
26, "Cross Examination", he argues that (much to his own surprise) there
is no cross anywhere in the Bible. The word "cross" in the Bible is
translated from the Greek word (insert Greek letters here, haha)
pronounced stau-ross or stav-ross, and "crucify" is from stav-ro-oh.
Lidell and Scott's A GREEK-ENGLISH LEXICON devine stav-ross as "an
upright pale or stake. Of piles driven is to serve as a foundation. A
pale for impaling a corpse." Thayer's Greek-English Lexicon, a "King
James" reference much used by believers, agrees, and says the English
word "staff" derives from stav-ross. W.E. Vine's EXPOSITORY
DICTIONARY OF NEW TESTAMENT WORDS reports that stav-ross "denotes,
primarily, an upright pale or stake. On such malefactors were nailed
for execution. Both the noun and the verb... are originally to be
distinguished from the ecclesiastical form of a two-beamed cross. The
shape of the latter had its origin in ancient Chaldea and was used as
the symbol of the god Tammuz (being in the shape of the mystic Tau,
the initial of his name)... By the middle of the third century...
pagans were received in the churches... and were permitted largely to
retain their pagan signs and symbols. Hence the Tau, or T, in its
most frequent forms, with the cross-piece lowered, was adopted to
stand for the cross of Christ."<p>

So, (he quotes other sources), the Romans used upright stakes for
their executions, on which the victim was killed..., "it was
sometimes pointed and thrust through the victim to pin him to the
earth, or he was placed on top of the stake with its point upwards so
that it gradually pierced his body; or he was tied upon it and left
until death intervened; and there were other methods too. There is
not a scrap of evidence that a stav-ross was ever in the form of a
cross or even a T-shape."<p>

There is no cross in early Christian art before the middle of the
fifth century. The first clear crucifix appears in the seventh
century. Before then Jesus is almost always depicted as a fish or a
shepherd, never on a cross. Constantine's supposed fourth-century
vision of a cross in the sky was not of the instrument of execution,
it was of the Greek letter X (chi) with a P (rho) through it, the
well known "monogram" of Christ, from the first two letters of the
Greek word for Christ.<p>

So, Dan Barker argues, the traditional "cross" is a symbol derived
from pagan sources and is not a historically accurate shape of the
Roman instrument of execution. He writes "scholars have been aware of
the error but have been unable to resist the traditional
mistranslation. In the Eighteenth century some Anglican bishops
recommended eliminating the cross symbol altogether, but they were
ignored."<p><hr><h3 align=center>
