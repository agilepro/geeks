<br><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Trebuchet MS";mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>In regards to the
Pledge of Allegiance, I am very concerned with the actions of our president,
governor, and almost all of the national senators and representatives.&nbsp; When they took office,
they swore to uphold
the Constitution of our country.&nbsp; Despite this, they recently jumped on a McCarthy-esque bandwagon and
openly flouted the First Amendment to the Constitution.</span></p>
<br>

<p>What part of
the First Amendment is confusing?&nbsp;
“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion...”</p>
<br>

<p>Referring to
“God” in the Pledge of Allegiance, our national motto, or on our money is
respecting an establishment of religion.&nbsp;
It also implies that the 14% of Americans who don't believe in any god
are lesser citizens.&nbsp; This is similar to
when white men once made blacks and women lesser citizens, often using the
Bible as an endorsement.&nbsp; It wasn't
right then.&nbsp; It isn't right now.</p><br>

<p>It's not just
about being right or fair; it's also about being constitutional.&nbsp;
Our Constitution was designed to protect the
rights of the minorities from the tyranny of the majority.&nbsp;
All Americans have a constitutional right to
freedom <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i>of</i></b> religion.&nbsp; This
includes freedom <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i>from</i></b> religion,
because we can’t have true freedom unless we
have the right to choose “none of the above.”&nbsp; References to “God”
by our government impose the tyranny of a state
religion, and are thus unconstitutional.</p><br>

<p>Our nation was
founded as the first country that derived its power from a purely secular,
nonreligious basis.&nbsp; All nations before
then had kings and queens who used their supposed “god-given divine right” to
rule.&nbsp; Instead of this top-down power
structure, our founders wisely created a government which derived its powers
from the consent of the governed.&nbsp; They
also realized the inherent divisiveness of religion, and kept it specifically
out of our Constitution and government.&nbsp; 
The Treaty of Tripoli, signed by President John Adams and unanimously
approved by the Senate in 1797, stated&nbsp;
“The Government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the
Christian religion.”</p><br>

<p>As shown by the
national uproar and debate, religion is still divisive.&nbsp;
The Pledge of Allegiance is supposed to help
unite Americans.&nbsp; Having “God” in it
divides us.&nbsp; Let's return the Pledge to
its previous form, so we can all once again say “one nation, indivisible, with
liberty and justice of all.”<br>
