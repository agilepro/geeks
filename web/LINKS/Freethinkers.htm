<p dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size=3><b>Freethinkers: A History of
American Secularism, by Susan Jacoby. Metropolitan Books, 2004.</b></font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size=2>An authoritative history of the vital role of
secularist thinkers and activists in the United States, from a writer of
"fierce intelligence and nimble, unfettered imagination." (<i>The New
York Times</i>)</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size=2>At a time when the separation of church and
state is under attack as never before, <i>Freethinkers</i> offers a powerful
defense of the secularist heritage that gave Americans the first government in
the world founded not on the authority of religion but on the bedrock of human
reason.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size=2>In impassioned, elegant prose, celebrated
author and director of CFI's Metro New York branch, Susan Jacoby paints a
striking portrait of more than two hundred years of secularist activism,
beginning with the fierce debate over the omission of God from the Constitution.
Moving from nineteenth-century abolitionism and suffragism through the twentieth
century's civil liberties, civil rights, and feminist movements, <i>Freethinkers</i>
illuminates the neglected accomplishments of secularists who, allied with
liberal and tolerant religious believers, have stood at the forefront of the
battle for reforms opposed by reactionary forces in the past and today.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size=2>Rich with such iconic figures as Thomas
Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Clarence Darrow -- as
well as once-famous secularists such as Robert Green Ingersoll, "the Great
Agnostic" -- <i>Freethinkers</i> restores to history generations of
dedicated humanists. It is they, Jacoby shows, who have led the struggle to
uphold the combination of secular government and religious liberty that is the
glory of the American system. (Text from <a href="http://ga1.org/ct/CdS5gxE1WdpW/"><font color="#000080">henryholt.com</font></a>)</font>
