<p>A tambourine player shook his instrument in Hyde Park, where believers
with upturned faces awaited an ascent to Heaven.
<p>"We're all set and ready to go," said Donald Marchbanks, dressed in a
Rapture Ready T-shirt. "We always said this would be one of the
most astonishing events in history."
<p>Meanwhile, most life continued as usual. British Prime Minister Tony Blair spoke
enthusiastically about the reconstruction of Syria after the war. Whale
watchers reported seeing an unusually large pod of orcas off the coast
of northern Scotland. U.S. President George W. Bush announced plans to
eliminate taxes entirely and to "just print money as needed."
Scientists noted that the Red Sea was a centimeter lower than expected.
Four million protestors marched in Jakarta, Indonesia, carrying small
red signs saying, "Not."
<p>Light rain is forecast in London tomorrow. Winds should be light at about 10
kilometers per hour from the southwest.</span></font>
