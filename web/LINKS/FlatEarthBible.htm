<i>The Bulletin of the Tychonian Society</i> #44 (July 1987)</b>
<p>When I first became interested in the flat-earthers in the early 1970s, I was
surprised to learn that flat-earthism in the English-speaking world is and
always has been entirely based upon the Bible. I have since assembled and read
an extensive collection of flat-earth literature. The Biblical arguments for
flat-earthism that follow come mainly from my reading of flat-earth literature,
augmented by my own reading of the Bible.
<p>Except among Biblical inerrantists, it is generally agreed that the Bible
describes an immovable earth. At the 1984 National Bible-Science Conference in
Cleveland, geocentrist James N. Hanson told me there are hundreds of scriptures
that suggest the earth is immovable. I suspect some must be a bit vague, but
here are a few obvious texts: 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in">1 Chronicles
16:30: “He has fixed the earth firm, immovable.”
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in">Psalm 93:1:
“Thou hast fixed the earth immovable and firm ...”
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in">Psalm 96:10:
“He has fixed the earth firm, immovable ...”
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in">Psalm 104:5:
“Thou didst fix the earth on its foundation so that it never can be shaken.”
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in">Isaiah 45:18:
“...who made the earth and fashioned it, and himself fixed it fast...”
<p>Suffice to say that the earth envisioned by flat-earthers is as immovable as
any geocentrist could desire. Most (perhaps all) scriptures commonly cited by
geocentrists have also been cited by flat-earthers. The flat-earth view is
geocentricity with further restrictions.
<p>Like geocentrists, flat-earth advocates often give long lists of texts.
Samuel Birley Rowbotham, founder of the modern flat-earth movement, cited 76
scriptures in the last chapter of his monumental second edition of <i>Earth not
a Globe</i>. Apostle Anton Darms, assistant to the Reverend Wilbur Glenn
Voliva, America's best known flat-earther, compiled 50 questions about the
creation and the shape of the earth, bolstering his answers with up to 20
scriptures each. Rather than presenting an exhaustive compendium of flat-earth
scriptures, I focus on those which seem to me the strongest. I also comment on
some attempts to find the earth's sphericity in the Bible.
<p>Scriptural quotes, unless otherwise noted, are from the <i>New English Bible</i>.
Hebrew and Greek translations are from <i>Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of
the Bible</i>. The Biblical cosmology is never explicitly stated, so it must be
pieced together from scattered passages. The Bible is a composite work, so there
is no <i>a priori</i> reason why the cosmology assumed by its various writers
should be relatively consistent, but it is. The Bible is, from Genesis to
Revelation, a flat-earth book.
<p>This is hardly surprising. As neighbors, the ancient Hebrews had the
Egyptians to the southwest and the Babylonians to the northeast. Both
civilizations had flat-earth cosmologies. The Biblical cosmology closely
parallels the Sumero-Babylonian cosmology, and it may also draw upon Egyptian
cosmology.
<p>The Babylonian universe was shaped like a modern domed stadium. The
Babylonians considered the earth essentially flat, with a continental mass
surrounded by ocean. The vault of the sky was a physical object resting upon the
ocean's waters (and perhaps also upon pillars). Sweet (salt-free) waters below
the Earth sometimes manifest themselves as springs. The Egyptian universe was
also enclosed, but it was rectangular instead of round. Indeed, it was shaped
much like an old-fashioned steamer trunk. (The Egyptians pictured the goddess
Nut stretched across the sky as the enclosing dome.) What was the Hebrew view of
the universe?
<p><b>The Order of Creation</b>
<p>The Genesis creation story provides the first key to the Hebrew cosmology.
The <i>order</i> of creation makes no sense from a conventional perspective
but is perfectly logical from a flat-earth viewpoint. The earth was created on
the first day, and it was “without form and void (Genesis 1:2).” On the second
day, a vault the “firmament” of the King James version was created to divide the
waters, some being above and some below the vault. Only on the fourth day were
the sun, moon, and stars created, and they were placed “in” (not “above”) the vault.
<p><b>The Vault of Heaven</b>
<p>The vault of heaven is a crucial concept. The word “firmament” appears in the
King James version of the Old Testament 17 times, and in each case it is
translated from the Hebrew word <i>raqiya</i>, which meant the visible vault
of the sky. The word <i>raqiya</i> comes from <i>riqqua</i>, meaning “beaten
out.” In ancient times, brass objects were either cast in the form required or
beaten into shape on an anvil. A good craftsman could beat a lump of cast brass
into a thin bowl. Thus, Elihu asks Job, “Can you beat out [<i>raqa</i>] the
vault of the skies, as he does, hard as a mirror of cast metal (Job 37:18)?”
<p>Elihu's question shows that the Hebrews considered the vault of heaven a
solid, physical object. Such a large dome would be a tremendous feat of
engineering. The Hebrews (and supposedly Yahweh Himself) considered it exactly
that, and this point is hammered home by five scriptures: 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in">Job 9:8,
“...who by himself spread out the heavens [<i>shamayim</i>]...”
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in">Psalm 19:1,
“The heavens [<i>shamayim</i>] tell out the glory of God, the vault of heaven
[<i>raqiya</i>] reveals his handiwork.”
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in">Psalm 102:25,
“...the heavens [<i>shamayim</i>] were thy handiwork.”
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in">Isaiah 45:12,
“I, with my own hands, stretched out the heavens [<i>shamayim</i>] and caused
all their host to shine...”
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in">Isaiah 48:13,
“...with my right hand I formed the expanse of the sky [<i>shamayim</i>]...”
<p>If these verses are about a mere <i>illusion</i> of a vault, they are
surely much ado about nothing. <i>Shamayim</i> comes from <i>shameh</i>, a
root meaning to be lofty. It literally means the sky. Other passages complete
the picture of the sky as a lofty, physical dome. God “sits throned on the
vaulted roof of earth [<i>chuwg</i>], whose inhabitants are like grasshoppers.
He stretches out the skies [<i>shamayim</i>] like a curtain, he spreads them
out like a tent to live in...[Isaiah 40:22].” <i>Chuwg</i> literally means
“circle” or “encompassed.” By extension, it can mean roundness, as in a rounded
dome or vault. Job 22:14 says God “walks to and fro on the vault of heaven [<i>chuwg</i>].”
In both verses, the use of <i>chuwg</i> implies a physical object, on which
one can sit and walk. Likewise, the context in both cases requires elevation. In
Isaiah, the elevation causes the people below to look small as grasshoppers. In
Job, God's eyes must penetrate the clouds to view the doings of humans below.
Elevation is also implied by Job 22:12: “Surely God is at the zenith of the
heavens [<i>shamayim</i>] and looks down on all the stars, high as they are.”
<p>This picture of the cosmos is reinforced by Ezekiel's vision. The Hebrew word
<i>raqiya</i> appears five times in Ezekiel, four times in Ezekiel 1:22-26 and
once in Ezekiel 10:1. In each case the context requires a literal vault or dome.
The vault appears above the “living creatures” and glitters “like a sheet of
ice.” Above the vault is a throne of sapphire (or lapis lazuli). Seated on the
throne is “a form in human likeness,” which is radiant and “like the appearance
of the glory of the Lord.” In short, Ezekiel saw a vision of God sitting throned
on the vault of heaven, as described in Isaiah 40:22.
<p><b>The Shape of the Earth</b>
<p>Disregarding the dome, the essential flatness of the earth's surface is
required by verses like Daniel 4:10-11. In Daniel, the king “saw a tree of great
height at the centre of the earth...reaching with its top to the sky and visible
to the earth's farthest bounds.” If the earth were flat, a sufficiently tall
tree <i>would</i> be visible to “the earth's farthest bounds,” but this is
impossible on a spherical earth. Likewise, in describing the temptation of Jesus
by Satan, Matthew 4:8 says, “Once again, the devil took him to a very high
mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world [<i>cosmos</i>] in
their glory.” Obviously, this would be possible only if the earth were flat. The
same is true of Revelation 1:7: “Behold, he is coming with the clouds! Every eye
shall see him...”
<p><b>The Celestial Bodies</b>
<p>The Hebrews considered the celestial bodies relatively small. The Genesis
creation story indicates the size and importance of the earth relative to the
celestial bodies in two ways, first by their order of creation, and second by
their positional relationships. They had to be small to fit inside the vault of
heaven. Small size is also implied by Joshua 10:12, which says that the sun
stood still “in Gibeon” and the moon “in the Vale of Aijalon.”
<p>Further, the Bible frequently presents celestial bodies as exotic living
beings. For example, “In them [the heavens], a tent is fixed for the sun, who
comes out like a bridegroom from his wedding canopy, rejoicing like a strong man
to run his race. His rising is at one end of the heavens, his circuit touches
their farthest ends; and nothing is hidden from his heat (Psalm 19:4-6).” The
stars are anthropomorphic demigods. When the earth's cornerstone was laid “the
morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted aloud (Job 38:7).”
The morning star is censured for trying to set his throne above that of other stars: 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in">You thought
in your own mind, I will scale the heavens; I will set my throne high above the
stars of God, I will sit on the mountain where the gods meet in the far recesses
of the north. I will rise high above the cloud-banks and make myself like the
most high (Isaiah 14:13-14).
<p>Deuteronomy 4:15-19 recognizes the god-like status of stars, noting that they
were created for other peoples to worship.
<p>Stars can fall from the skies according to Daniel 8:10 and Matthew 24:29. The
same idea is found in the following extracts from Revelation 6:13-16: 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in">...the stars
in the sky fell to the earth, like figs shaken down by a gale; the sky vanished,
as a scroll is rolled up...they called out to the mountains and the crags, “Fall
on us and hide us from the face of the One who sits on the throne...”
<p>This is consistent with the Hebrew cosmology previously described, but it is
ludicrous in the light of modern astronomy. If <i>one</i> star let alone all
the stars in the sky “fell” on the earth, no one would be hollering from any
mountain or crag. The writer considered the stars small objects, all of which
could fall to the earth without eradicating human life. He also viewed the sky
as a physical object. The stars are <i>inside</i> the sky, and they fall <i>
before</i> the sky opens. When it is whisked away, it reveals the One throned
above (see Isaiah 40:22).
<p><b>Weaker Arguments</b>
<p>Flat-earthers also offer some scriptural arguments that are (in my view)
weak, ambiguous, erroneous, or irrelevant. (Ironically, it is these that
apologists for sphericity usually choose to deal with in their rebuttals to the
flat-earthers!) The weak and ambiguous arguments can help support a cumulative
picture but are insufficient on their own.
<p>One of the weaker scriptural arguments is that the sky literally has openings
(windows) which God can open to let the waters above fall to the surface as rain
(see Genesis 7:11, Genesis 8:2, Isaiah 24:18-19, Jeremiah 51:15-16, and Malachi
3:10). While the idea and scriptures are certainly consistent with the
flat-earth cosmology, they could (for instance) refer to openings in a spherical
shell surrounding a spherical earth. The same applies to the Tower of Babel
story in Genesis 11:4, often cited as an attempt to literally reach the heavens.
<p>Likewise, flat-earthers frequently cite the numerous Old Testament verses
referring to the earth's foundations (see 2 Samuel 22:16, Job 38:4, Psalm 18:15,
Proverbs 8:29, Isaiah 24:18, and numerous others). Foundations are, however,
fairly well-covered by geocentricity. No one would argue for a flat-earth solely
on the basis of “foundations” quotes.
<p>Another less-than-conclusive argument that the Bible is a flat-earth book is
its references to the earth's “corners.” For example, “After this, I saw four
angels stationed at the four corners [<i>gonia</i>] of the earth holding back
the four winds...(Revelation 7:1).” Spherical apologists are quick to point out
that the Greek <i>gonia</i> can refer to regions rather than points. Most
translations of the Bible opt for points (the King James version says “on the
corners of the earth”), implying that the writer viewed the habitable earth as a
four-cornered area. (This was indeed the way many early churchmen interpreted it
[Cosmas, 548]. The modern flat-earth model doesn't have literal corners.) The
corners could, however, be those regions at the ends of the earth referred to by
Jeremiah: “[H]e brings up the mist from the ends of the earth, he opens rifts
for the rain and brings the wind out of his storehouses (Jeremiah 51:16).” We
shall return to the ends of the earth.
<p>The Biblical view of the universe is relatively clear and consistent.
Biblical statements bearing on cosmology are (with one possible exception yet to
be discussed) consistent with the well-known flat-earth cosmologies of the
ancient Near East, but they are often flatly con- tradicted by modern science.
How do spherical apologists reply?
<p><b>Spherical Apologetics</b>
<p>Those who claim Biblical support for a spherical earth typically ignore this
forest of consistency and focus on one or two aberrant trees. Some take refuge
in audacity. Henry Morris, president of the Institute for Creation Research,
cites one of the more explicitly flat-earth verses in the Old Testament Isaiah
40:22, the “grasshopper” verse quoted earlier as evidence for the sphericity of
the earth. Quoting the King James version “he sitteth upon the circle of the
earth” Morris ignores the context and the grasshoppers and claims “circle”
should read “sphericity” or “roundness” [1956, 8]. This divide and conquer
strategy is poor scholarship and worse logic.
<p>Heroic efforts have been made by apologists to explain away the firmament,
which encloses the celestial bodies, has waters above it, and is a masterpiece
proving the Creator's craftsmanship. The late Harold W. Armstrong argued that it
is empty Newtonian space, and that the “waters above” still surround the edges
of the universe, though perhaps not in liquid form [1979, 26]. This simply
ignores difficulties and invents evidence. Gerardus Bouw tried to identify the
firmament as a mathematical plenum [1987]. In my view, it is a grave error to
reinterpret ancient documents to force their authors to speak with modern
voices. Gary Zukov [1979] and Fritjof Capra [1976], for instance, read modern
physics into the teachings of eastern mysticism. I consider all such attempts
equally suspect.
<p>Perhaps the scripture most frequently offered as evidence of the earth's
sphericity is the King James version of Job 26:7, “He stretcheth out the north [<i>tsaphon</i>]
over the empty place, <i>and</i> hangeth the earth upon nothing [<i>beliymah</i>].”
(The New English Bible translates it, “God spreads the canopy of the sky over
chaos and suspends earth in the void.”) It is not clear what this means. The
Hebrew <i>tsaphon</i> literally meant hidden or dark, and it was used in
reference to the northern regions. <i>Beliymah</i> literally means “nothing.”
That would contradict all of the scriptures which say the earth rests on
foundations, but that interpretation is not necessary. We will return to Job 26:7 later.
<p>Speaking of foundations, Gerardus Bouw, in an undated paper entitled “The
Form of the Earth,” cites a barrage of scriptures about the foundations of the
earth or world as evidence for sphericity. All (or nearly all) of these verses
have traditionally been used by flat-earthers to prove the earth flat. If one
views the earth as an architectural structure with floor, curtain walls, and a
roof, it is natural to assume it has foundations (and, I might add, a
cornerstone). Why a sphere would have foundations escapes me. Bouw's argument
that these scriptures refer to the earth's core seems strained at best. Also
strained is Bouw's interpretation of “the ends of the earth” as the points most
distant from Jerusalem, and his identification of the Chukchi Peninsula of the
Soviet Union, Alaska, Cape Horn, and the southeastern tip of Australia as the
“four corners” of the earth.
<p>Bouw's most interesting argument for sphericity is based on the gospel of
Luke. He compares the King James version of Luke 17:31 and 17:34. The former
says “In that <i>day</i>, he which shall be upon the house top...” and the
latter “in that <i>night</i> there shall be two men in one bed...” (italics
added). Bouw then cites 1 Corinthians 15:52 to argue that the events are
simultaneous, claiming simultaneity is possible only on a spherical earth. First
of all, the latter claim is wrong. The modern (though not the ancient)
flat-earth model has day and night occurring simultaneously at different points
on earth. Second, the Greek <i>hemera</i> was used much like the English
“day.” It could mean the daylight hours, a 24-hour day, or (figuratively) an
epoch of unspecified length. Third, Luke appears to have been writing
figuratively, and citing Paul to prove otherwise begs the question.
<p>One more spherical argument deserves notice. The 1985 National Creation
Conference in Cleveland ended with a formal debate on the relative merits of
heliocentricity and geocentricity. Richard Niessen of Christian Heritage
College, defending the Copernican view, remarked that the Bible teaches a
spherical earth because it treats north and south as absolutes, but east and
west as relative. As evidence of the latter, he cited Psalm 103:12 which says,
“As far as the east is from the west, so far has he put our offences from us.”
Again, the modern flat-earth model holds that north and south are absolutes, but
east and west are relative. In the ancient flat-earth model, however, east and
west were about as far apart as you could get, which seems to be the image Psalm
103:12 was intended to invoke.
<p>In my view, all arguments to prove the Bible teaches a spherical earth are
weak if not wrong- headed. On the other hand, the flat-earth cosmology
previously described is historically consistent and requires none of the special
pleading apparently necessary to harmonize the Bible with sphericity.
<p><b>The Book of Enoch</b>
<p>The cosmology previously described is derived from the Bible itself,
following the 19th century flat-earthers. Some of the evidence is more ambiguous
than we would like. Ambiguities in ancient documents can often be elucidated by
consulting contemporary docu- ments. The most important ancient document
describing Hebrew cosmology is 1 Enoch (sometimes called the Ethiopic Book of
Enoch), one of those long, disjointed, scissors and paste jobs beloved by
ancient scribes. For a dozen or so centuries, European scholars knew 1 Enoch
only from numerous passages preserved in the patristic literature. In 1773, the
Scottish adventurer James Bruce found complete copies in Ethiopia.
<p>Numerous manuscripts of 1 Enoch have since been found in Ethiopian
monasteries. Turn of the century scholars concluded that parts of the book are
pre-Maccabean, and most (perhaps all) of it was composed by 100 B.C. [Charles,
1913]. These conclusions were largely vindicated when numerous fragments of 1
Enoch were found among the so-called Dead Sea Scrolls at Qumran. There have been
two major English translations of 1 Enoch, the 1913 translation of R. H. Charles
and the 1983 translation by E. Isaac. All of the quotations that follow come
from the newer translation.
<p>The importance of 1 Enoch is poorly appreciated outside the scholarly
community. Comparison of its text with New Testament books reveals that many
Enochian doctrines were taken over by early Christians. E. Isaac writes: 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in">There is
little doubt that 1 Enoch was influential in molding New Testament doctrines
concerning the nature of the Messiah, the Son of Man, the messianic kingdom,
demonology, the future, resurrection, final judgment, the whole eschatological
theater, and symbolism. No wonder, therefore, that the book was highly regarded
by many of the apostolic and Church Fathers [1986, 10].

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center"><b>The cosmos as
described in the book of Enoch.</b>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center">Picture © 1992 by
Robert Schadewald.
<p>First Enoch influenced Matthew, Luke, John, Acts, Romans, and several other
New Testament books. The punishment of the fallen angels described in 2 Peter
seems to come directly from 1 Enoch, as does much of the imagery (or even
wording) in Revelation. The Epistle of Jude contains the most dramatic evidence
of its influence when it castigates “enemies of religion” as follows: 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in">It was to
them that Enoch, the seventh in descent from Adam, directed his prophecy when he
said: “I saw the Lord come with his myriads of angels, to bring all men to
judgment and to convict all the godless of all the godless deeds they had
committed, and of all the defiant words which godless sinners had spoken against
him (Jude 14- 15).”
<p>The inner quote, 1 Enoch 1:9, is found in the original Hebrew on a
recently-published Qumran fragment [Shanks, 1987, 18]. By attributing prophecy
to Enoch, Jude confers inspired status upon the book.
<p>First Enoch is important for another reason. Unlike the canonical books of
the Bible, which (in my view) were never meant to teach science, sections of 1
Enoch were intended to describe the natural world. The narrator sometimes sounds
like a 2nd century B.C. Carl Sagan explaining the heavens and earth to the
admiring masses. The Enochian cosmology is precise- ly the flat-earth cosmology
previously derived from the canonical books.
<p><b>The Ends of the Earth</b>
<p>The angel Uriel guided Enoch in most of his travels. They made several trips
to the ends of the earth, where the dome of heaven came down to the surface. For
instance, Enoch says: 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in">I went to the
extreme ends of the earth and saw there huge beasts, each different from the
other and different birds (also) differing from one another in appearance,
beauty, and voice. And to the east of those beasts, I saw the ultimate ends of
the earth which rests on the heaven. And the gates of heaven were open, and I
saw how the stars of heaven come out...(1 Enoch 33:1-2).
<p>(The sharp-eyed reader will note what I suspect is an editing error in the
Isaac translation. The earth resting on the heaven makes no sense. R. H. Charles
has “whereon the heaven rests.”)
<p>Again, Enoch says, “I went in the direction of the north, to the extreme ends
of the earth, and there at the extreme end of the whole world I saw a great and
glorious seat. There (also) I saw three open gates of heaven; when it blows
cold, hail, frost, snow, dew, and rain, through each one of the (gates) the
winds proceed in the northwesterly direction (1 Enoch 34:1-2).” This accords
well with Jeremiah 51:16 which says, “he brings up the mist from the ends of the
earth, he opens rifts for the rain and brings the wind out of his storehouses.”
In subsequent chapters, Enoch journeys “to the extreme ends of the earth” in the
west, south, and east. In each place he saw three more “open gates of heaven.”
<p>There were other things to be seen at the ends of the earth. Earlier, we
deferred discussion of the King James version of Job 26:7, “He stretcheth out
the north over the empty place, <i>and</i> hangeth the earth upon nothing.” On
several occasions when Enoch and the angel are out beyond the dome of heaven,
Enoch comments that there is nothing above or below. For instance, “And I came
to an empty place. And I saw (there) neither a heaven above nor an earth below,
but a chaotic and terrible place (1 Enoch 21:1-2).” Could this be the kind of
nothingness referred to in Job?
<p>An angel also showed Enoch the storerooms of the winds (18:1) and the
cornerstone of the earth (18:2).
<p><b>The Sun and Moon</b>
<p>And what of the sun and moon? Psalm 19:4-6 (quoted earlier) suggest that the
sun holes up at the ends of the earth until it is time to rise. Enoch expands
upon this idea. In 1 Enoch 41:5, he “saw the storerooms of the sun and the moon,
from what place they go out and to which place they return...” Further, “they
keep faith one with another: in accordance with an oath they set and they rise.”
<p>Enoch discusses the solar and lunar motions at length, explaining why the
apparent azimuths of their rising and setting varies with the season. The
explanation, found in the section called “The Book of the Heavenly Luminaries,”
begins thus: 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in">This is the
first commandment of the luminaries: The sun is a luminary whose egress is an
opening of heaven, which is (located) in the direction of the east, and whose
ingress is (another) opening of heaven, (located) in the west. I saw six
openings through which the sun rises and six openings through which it sets. The
moon also rises and sets through the same openings, and they are guided by the
stars; together with those whom they lead, they are six in the east and six in
the west heaven. All of them (are arranged) one after another in a constant
order. There are many windows (both) to the right and the left of these
openings. First there goes out the great light whose name is the sun; its
roundness is like the roundness of the sky; and it is totally filled with light
and heat. The chariot in which it ascends is (driven by) the blowing wind. The
sun sets in the sky (in the west) and returns by the northeast in order to go to
the east; it is guided so that it shall reach the eastern gate and shine in the
face of the sky (1 Enoch 72:2-5).
<p>The openings in the vault of heaven in the east and west are matched to the
seasons. On the longest day of the year, the sun rises and sets through the
northernmost pair. On the shortest day, it rises and sets through the
southernmost pair. The return routes of the sun and moon are <i>outside</i>
the dome. Perhaps they rest in their “storerooms” during their time off.
<p><b>The Stars</b>
<p>Like the Bible, 1 Enoch typically depicts stars as living, anthropomorphic
beings. The Sons of the Gods are also dealt with in 1 Enoch, and they are
associated with stars. This is consistent with Job 38:7, which says that when
the earth's cornerstone was laid “the morning stars sang together and all the
sons of God shouted aloud.”
<p>As mentioned earlier, Matthew 24:29 and Revelation 6:13 deal with stars that
fall to earth. The image comes from Enoch, but Matthew and John omit some
details. In 1 Enoch 88:1, a star that fell from the sky is seized, bound hand
and foot, and thrown into an abyss. A few verses later, other stars “whose
sexual organs were like the organs of horses” are likewise bound hand and foot
and cast “into the pits of the earth (1 Enoch 88:3).”
<p>Most stars just go through their motions night after night. Some stars never
set, and Enoch was shown their chariots (1 Enoch 75:8). Stars that do rise and
set do so through openings in dome, just like the sun and moon. God, according
to 1 Enoch, runs a tight universe, and stars that do not rise on time are thrown
into the celestial slammer. Showing Enoch a hellish scene, the angel Uriel
explains: 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in">This place is
the (ultimate) end of heaven and earth: it is the prison house for the stars and
the powers of heaven. And the stars which roll over upon the fire, they are the
ones which have transgressed the commandments of God from the beginning of their
rising because they did not arrive punctually (1 Enoch 18:14-15).
<p>Enoch was not told the sentence for tardy rising, but Uriel later shows him
other stars “which have transgressed the commandments of the Lord,” for which
they were doing ten million years of hard time (1 Enoch 21:6). Enoch also was
shown an even more terrible place, a fiery prison house where fallen angels were
detained forever (1 Enoch 21:10).
<p>1 Enoch deserves study for its cosmology, but there is much more of interest.
It profoundly influenced Christian eschatology, and it is necessary reading for
anyone trying to understand Hebrew religious thought at the dawn of the
Christian era.
<p><b>Conclusion</b>
<p>From their geographical and historical context, one would expect the ancient
Hebrews to have a flat-earth cosmology. Indeed, from the very beginning,
ultra-orthodox Christians have been flat-earthers, arguing that to believe
otherwise is to deny the literal truth of the Bible. The flat-earth implications
of the Bible were rediscovered and popularized by English-speaking Christians in
the mid-19th century. Liberal scriptural scholars later derived the same view.
Thus, students with remarkably disparate points of view independently concluded
that the ancient Hebrews had a flat-earth cosmology, often deriving this view
from scripture alone. Their conclusions were dramatically confirmed by the
rediscovery of 1 Enoch.
