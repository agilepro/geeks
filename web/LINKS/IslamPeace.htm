<b>"Rejecting Islam is insulting God. We will not allow God to be humiliated. This man must die."</b><br>
- “moderate” Afghan imam Abdul Raoulf, about a man who converted from Islam to Christianity<p>
<b>"The spread of Islam was military. There is a tendency to apologize for this and we should not. It is one of the injunctions of the Qur'an that you must fight to spread Islam."</b><br>
- Dr. Ali Issa Othman, Islamic Scholar<p><hr><p>
<h2>&nbsp; From the “holy” Quran:</h2>
2:191-193 – "And slay them wherever ye find them, and drive them out of the places whence they drove you out, for persecution [of Muslims] is worse than slaughter [of non-believers]…and fight them until persecution is no more, and religion is for Allah."<p>
2:216 – "Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not."<p>
2:244 – "Then fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah Heareth and knoweth all things."<p>
5:33 - "The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement."<p>
8:12 – "Remember thy Lord inspired the angels (with the message): "I am with you: give firmness to the Believers: I will instil terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers: smite ye above their necks and smite all their finger-tips off them."<p>
8:55 - "Surely the vilest of animals in Allah's sight are those who disbelieve."<p>
9:5 - "fight and slay the pagans (or infidels or unbelievers) wherever you find them."<p>
9:29 – "Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued."<p>
9:30 - "And the Jews say: Ezra is the son of Allah, and the Christians say: The Messiah is the son of Allah... Allah (Himself) fights against them. How perverse are they!"<p>
9:41 – "Go forth, light-armed and heavy-armed, and strive with your wealth and your lives in the way of Allah! That is best for you if ye but knew."<p>
9:73 – "O Prophet! strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be unyielding to them; and their abode is hell, and evil is the destination."<p>
9:88 – "But the Messenger, and those who believe with him, strive and fight with their wealth and their persons: for them are (all) good things: and it is they who will prosper."<p>
9:111 – "Allah hath purchased of the believers their persons and their goods; for theirs (in return) is the garden (of Paradise): they fight in His cause, and slay and are slain: apromise binding on Him in truth, through the Law, the Gospel, and the Quran: and who is more faithful to his covenant than Allah? then rejoice in the bargain which ye have concluded: that is the achievement supreme."<p>
9:123 – "O you who believe! fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find in you hardness."<p>
25:52 – "Therefore listen not to the Unbelievers, but strive against them with the utmost strenuousness…"<p>
47:3-4 – "Those who reject Allah follow vanities, while those who believe follow the truth from their lord. Thus does Allah set forth form men their lessons by similtudes. Therefore when you meet in battle those who disbelieve, then smite the necks until when you have overcome them, then make (them) prisoners,"<p>
61:9 - "He it is who has sent His Messenger (Mohammed) with guidance and the religion of truth (Islam) to make it victorious over all religions even though the infidels may resist."<p>
66:9 – "O Prophet! Strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be stern with them. Hell will be their home, a hapless journey’s end."<p>
