<h1>Dogs (not chimps) most like humans</h1>
<h2>Man's best friend serves as model for understanding human social behavior</h2>
<p>Chimpanzees may share many of our genes, but dogs have lived with us for so
long that they offer a good model for understanding human social behavior.

<p>Chimpanzees share many of our
genes, but dogs have lived with us for so long and undergone so much
domestication that they are now serving as a model for understanding human
social behavior, according to a new paper.
<p>Cooperation, attachment to
people, <a href="http://animals.howstuffworks.com/pets/dog-best-friend.htm">
understanding human verbal</a> and non-verbal communications, and the ability to
imitate are just a handful of the social behaviors we share with dogs. They
might even think like us at times too, according to the paper, which has been
accepted for publication in the journal Advances in the Study of Behavior.
<p>While there is no evidence to
support that dogs and humans co-evolved their laundry list of shared behaviors
over the past 10,000 to 20,000 years, the researchers believe adapting to the
same living conditions during this period may have resulted in the similarities.
<p>Lead author Jozsef Topal explained to Discovery News "that shared
<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29895614/#">environment</a> has led to the
emergence of functionally shared behavioral
features in dogs and humans and, in some cases, functionally analogous
underlying cognitive skills."
<p>Topal, who is based at the
Institute for Psychology at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, is one of the
world's leading canine researchers. He and his team argue that dogs should serve
as the "new chimpanzees" in comparative studies designed to shed light on human
uniqueness.
<p>"In my view,
<a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/dog.htm">pet dogs</a> can be regarded in
many respects as 'preverbal infants in canine's clothing,'" he said, adding that
many dog-owner relationships mirror human parental bonds with children.
<p>In one of many recent studies
conducted by the team, Topal and his colleagues taught both a 16-month-old human
child and mature dogs to repeat multiple demonstrated actions on verbal command
â€” "Do it!," shouted in Hungarian.
<p>The actions included turning
around in circles, vocalizing, jumping up, jumping over a horizontal rod,
putting an object into a container, carrying an object to the owner or parent,
and pushing a rod to the floor.
<p>The dogs "performed
surprisingly well and at a comparable level to the 16-month-old child," Topal
said.
<p>Multiple studies mentioned by
the authors also support that dogs exhibit all three primary types of social
behavior that humans evolved when they split from chimpanzees 6 million years
ago. The first is "sociality," or <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29895614/#">organization</a> into
groups where members are loyal to each other and
<a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2008/06/26/dog-aggression.html">display
reduced aggression</a>.
<p>The second is synchronization, where following shared
social rules and even taking on each others emotions helps to strengthen group
unity. The researchers, for example, say that, "when approached by an unfamiliar
person showing definite signs of friendliness and threat in succession, dogs
show rapid changes of emotional and behavioral response in accordance with the
human's attitude."
<p>The third is "constructive
activity," where individuals within a group cooperate and communicate with each
other to achieve goals. Dogs can also distinguish rational from irrational human
communications, Topal said.
<p>The scientists additionally
believe dogs are good models for human social behavior because studies can
compare and contrast domesticated dogs with wolves, and then with humans.
<p>Marc Hauser, a professor and
director of the Cognitive Evolution Lab at Harvard University, fully agrees that
dogs offer a good model for understanding human behavior.
