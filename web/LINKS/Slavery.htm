<h2>God and Slavery</h2>

by Margaret Knight, lecturer, Aberdeen University.<p>

"There is no justification for the common claim that Christianity
was responsible for the abolition of slavery. The Negro slave
trade—a far more infamous practice than slavery in the ancientworld—was initiated,
carried on and defended by Christian menin Christian countries. To quote H.A.L. Fisher, "It is a terrible
commentary on Christian civilisation that the longest period of
slave-raiding known to history was initiated by the action of Spain
and Portugal, France, Holland and Britain, after the Christian
faith had for more than a thousand years been the establised
religion of Europe" (History of Europe, Chap. 23).<p>

"The abolitionist movement took its impetus, not from
Christianity which had condoned slavery for centuries, but from
the secular humanitarianism of the Enlightenment. Many of the
leading abolitionists were unbelievers — Condorcet and otherleading figures
of the Revolution in France, Abraham Lincoln in
America, Fox and Pitt in Great Britain.<p>

Christians like William Wilberforce who actively opposed the
slave trade were far from typical: with the honourable exception
of the Quakers, the attitude of most of the Churches towards
abolition was in America actively hostile, and in Britain (to use
Wilberforce's own words)~ "shamefully lukewarm". The
Churches, of course, had no difficulty in citing: scriptural authority
for their attitude. The Old Testament condones it (Leviticus, 25,
44-46): and St. Paul told slaves to obey their masters."
(Colossians, 3, 22). (The Greek word for slave, "doulos", is
wrongly translated as "servant".)
