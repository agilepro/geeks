LOUIS, Missouri (Reuters) -- American scientists fighting back
against creationism, intelligent design and other theories that seek
to deny or downgrade the importance of evolution have recruited
unlikely allies -- the clergy.</b>
<p>And they have taken their battle to a new level, trying to
educate high school and even elementary school teachers on how to
hold their own against parents and school boards who want to mix
religion with science.
<p>While they feel they have won the latest round against efforts to
bring God into the classroom, the scientists say they have little
doubt their opponents are merely regrouping.
<p>"It's time to recognize that science and religion should never be
pitted against one another," American Association for the
Advancement of Science President Gilbert Omenn told a news
conference on Sunday. The AAAS has held several sessions on the
evolution issue at its annual meeting in St. Louis.
<p>"The faith community needs to step up to the plate," agreed
Eugenie Scott, Executive Director, National Center for Science
Education in Oakland, California.
<p>Scott said many people held the "toxic" idea that "you are either
a Christian creationist or you are a bad-guy atheist".
<p>Recent court and electoral battles have made clear that judges
and voters will reject efforts to sneak creationism into the
classroom under the guise of making a scientific curriculum clearer
or fairer, Scott said.
<p>By a vote of 11 to 4, the Ohio Board of Education last week
pulled a model lesson plan it had approved in 2004. The plan had
permitted science teachers to encourage students to look at
questions about evolution, something proponents of "intelligent
design" call "teaching the controversy."
<p>Last year in Pennsylvania, a federal court ruled the theory could
not be taught in a public school and the school board in Dover,
Pennsylvania, which approved the teaching, was voted out.
<p>Intelligent design proponents see the hand of God behind
evolution because, they say, life is too complex to be random.
<p>"As a legal strategy intelligent design is dead. It will be very
difficult for any school district in the future to successfully
survive a legal challenge," Scott said. "That doesn't mean
intelligent design is dead as a very popular social movement. This
is an idea that has got legs."
<p>But pastors are speaking out against it. Warren Eschbach, a
retired Church of the Brethren pastor and professor at Lutheran
Theological Seminary in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania helped sponsor a
letter signed by more than 10,000 other clergy.
<p>"We believe that the theory of evolution is a foundational
scientific truth, one that has stood up to rigorous scrutiny and
upon which much of human knowledge and achievement rests," they
wrote.
<p>Catholic experts have also joined the movement.
<p>"The intelligent design movement belittles God. It makes God a
designer, an engineer," said Vatican Observatory Director George
Coyne, an astrophysicist who is also ordained. "The God of religious
faith is a god of love. He did not design me."
<p>Gerry Wheeler, executive director of the National Science
Teachers Association said some teachers feared losing their jobs if
they taught evolution. "The pressures come from the students and the
parents," he said.
