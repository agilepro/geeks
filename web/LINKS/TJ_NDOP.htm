<h2 align=center>Thomas Jefferson, on prescribing religious exercise</h2>

"Certainly, no power to prescribe any religious exercise, or to
assume authority in religious discipline, has been delegated to
the General Government. It must then rest with the States, as far
as it can be in any human authority. But it is only proposed that
I should recommend, not prescribe a day of fasting and prayer.
That is, that I should indirectly assume to the United States an
authority over religious exercises, which the Constitution has
directly precluded them from. It must be meant, too, that this
recommendation is to carry some authority, and to be sanctioned
by some penalty on those who disregard it; not indeed of fine and
imprisonment, but of some degree of proscription, perhaps in
public opinion. And does the change in the nature of the penalty
make the recommendation less a law of conduct for those to whom
it is directed? I do not believe it is in the best interests of
religion to invite the civil magistrate to direct its exercises,
its discipline, or its doctrines; nor of the religious societies,
that the General Government should be invested with the power of
effecting any uniformity of time or matter among them. Fasting
and prayer are religious exercises; the enjoining them an act of
discipline. Every religious society has a right to determine for
itself the times of these exercises, and the objects proper for
them, according to their own particular tenets; and this right
can never be safer than in their own hands, where the
Constitution has deposited it."<br>
- Thomas Jefferson, 1/23/1808, just before
the end of his second term, in a letter to Samuel Miller - a
Presbyterian minister. <i>Jefferson's Letters</i>, pp. 241-242.
