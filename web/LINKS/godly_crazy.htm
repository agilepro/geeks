<h1>The Godly Must Be Crazy</h1>
<h2>Christian-right views are swaying politicians and threatening the environment</h2>
By Glenn Scherer<br>
27 Oct 2004
<p><em>A kind of secular apocalyptic sensibility pervades much contemporary
writing about our current world. Many books about environmental dangers, whether
it be the ozone layer, or global warming or pollution of the air or water, or
population explosion, are cast in an apocalyptic mold.</em><br>
- Historian Paul Boyer<p>
<em>When he opened the sixth seal, I looked, and behold, there was a great
earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth, the full moon became like
blood, and the stars of the sky fell to the earth as the fig tree sheds its
winter fruit when shaken by a gale; the sky vanished like a scroll that is
rolled up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place ...</em><br>
- Revelation 6:12-14<p>
Abortion. Same-sex marriage. Stem-cell research.<p>
U.S. legislators backed by the Christian right vote against these issues with
near-perfect consistency. That probably doesn't surprise you, but this might:
Those same legislators are equally united and unswerving in their opposition to
environmental protection.<br>
Forty-five senators and 186 representatives in 2003 earned 80- to 100-percent
approval ratings from the nation's three most influential Christian right
advocacy groups -- the Christian Coalition, Eagle Forum, and Family Resource
Council. Many of those same lawmakers also got flunking grades -- less than 10
percent, on average -- from the League of Conservation Voters last year.<p>
These statistics are puzzling at first. Opposing abortion and stem-cell research
is consistent with the religious right's belief that life begins at the moment
of conception. Opposing gay marriage is consistent with its claim that
homosexual activity is proscribed by the Bible. Both beliefs are a familiar
staple of today's political discourse. But a scripture-based justification for
anti-environmentalism?<a href="#correction">*</a><p>
Many Christian fundamentalists feel that concern for the future of our planet is
irrelevant, because it <em>has</em> no future. They believe we are living in the
End Time, when the son of God will return, the righteous will enter heaven, and
sinners will be condemned to eternal hellfire. They may also believe, along with
millions of other Christian fundamentalists, that environmental destruction is
not only to be disregarded but actually welcomed -- even hastened -- as a sign
of the coming Apocalypse.<p>
We are not talking about a handful of fringe lawmakers who hold or are
beholden to these beliefs. The 231 legislators (all but five of them
Republicans) who received an average 80 percent approval rating or higher
from the leading religious-right organizations make up more than 40 percent
of the U.S. Congress. (The only Democrat to score 100 percent with the
Christian Coalition was Sen. Zell Miller of Georgia, who earlier this year
quoted from the Book of Amos on the Senate floor: "The days will come,
sayeth the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land. Not a famine of
bread or of thirst for water, but of hearing the word of the Lord!")
These politicians include some of the most powerful figures in the U.S.
government, as well as key environmental decision makers: Senate Majority
Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.), Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.),
Senate Republican Conference Chair Rick Santorum (R-Penn.), Senate
Republican Policy Chair Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), House Speaker Dennis Hastert
(R-Ill.), House Majority Whip Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), U.S. Attorney General John
Ashcroft, and quite possibly President Bush. (Earlier this month, a cover
story by Ron Suskind in <em>The New York Times Magazine</em> described how
Bush's faith-based governance has led to, among other things, a disastrous
"crusade" in the Middle East and has laid the groundwork for
"a battle between modernists and fundamentalists, pragmatists and true
believers, reason and religion.")<p>
And those politicians are just the powerful tip of the iceberg. A 2002 <em>Time</em>/CNN
poll found that 59 percent of Americans believe that the prophecies found in
the Book of Revelation are going to come true. Nearly one-quarter think the
Bible predicted the 9/11 attacks.<p>
Like it or not, faith in the Apocalypse is a powerful driving force in
modern American politics. In the 2000 election, the Christian right cast at
least 15 million votes, or about 30 percent of those that propelled Bush
into the presidency. And there's no doubt that arch-conservative Christians
will be just as crucial in the coming election: GOP political strategist
Karl Rove hopes to mobilize 20 million fundamentalist voters to help sweep
Bush back into office on Nov. 2 and to maintain a Republican majority in
Congress, says Joan Bokaer, director of <a href="http://www.theocracywatch.org/" target="new">Theocracy
Watch</a>, a project of the Center for Religion, Ethics, and Social Policy
at Cornell University.<p>
Because of its power as a voting bloc, the Christian right has the ear, if
not the souls, of much of the nation's leadership. Some of those leaders are
End-Time believers themselves. Others are not. Either way, their votes are
heavily swayed by an electoral base that accepts the Bible as literal truth
and eagerly awaits the looming Apocalypse. And that, in turn, is sobering
news for those who hope for the protection of the earth, not its
destruction.<p>
<h3>Once Upon End Time</h3>
Ever since the dawn of Christianity, groups of believers have searched the
scriptures for signs of the End Time and the Second Coming. Today, most of
the roughly 50 million right-wing fundamentalist Christians in the United
States believe in some form of End-Time theology.<p>
Those 50 million believers make up only a subset of the estimated 100
million born-again evangelicals in the United States, who are by no means
uniformly right-wing anti-environmentalists. In fact, the political stances
of evangelicals on the environment and other issues range widely; the
Evangelical Environmental Network, for example, has melded its biblical
interpretation with good environmental science to justify and promote
stewardship of the earth. But the political and cultural impact of the
extreme Christian right is difficult to overestimate.<p>
It is also difficult to understand without grasping the complex belief
systems underlying and driving it. While there are many divergent End-Time
theologies and sects, the most politically influential are the
dispensationalists and reconstructionists.<p>
Tune in to any of America's 2,000 Christian radio stations or 250 Christian
TV stations and you're likely to get a heady dose of dispensationalism, an
End-Time doctrine invented in the 19th century by the Irish-Anglo theologian
John Nelson Darby. Dispensationalists espouse a "literal"
interpretation of the Bible that offers a detailed chronology of the
impending end of the world. (Many mainstream theologians dispute that
literality, arguing that Darby misinterprets and distorts biblical
passages.) Believers link that chronology to current events -- four
hurricanes hitting Florida, gay marriages in San Francisco, the 9/11 attacks
-- as proof that the world is spinning out of control and that we are what
dispensationalist writer Hal Lindsey calls "the terminal
generation." The social and environmental crises of our times,
dispensationalists say, are portents of the Rapture, when born-again
Christians, living and dead, will be taken up into heaven.<p>
"All over the earth, graves will explode as the occupants soar into the
heavens," preaches dispensationalist pastor John Hagee, of the
Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas. On the heels of that Rapture,
nonbelievers left behind on earth will endure seven years of unspeakable
suffering called the Great Tribulation, which will culminate in the rise of
the Antichrist and the final battle of Armageddon between God and Satan.
Upon winning that battle, Christ will send all unbelievers into the pits of
hellfire, re-green the planet, and reign on earth in peace with His
followers for a millennium.<p>
Dispensationalists haven't cornered the market on End-Time interpretation.
The reconstructionists (also known as dominionists), a smaller but
politically influential sect, put the onus for the Lord's return not in the
hands of biblical prophesy but in political activism. They believe that
Christ will only make his Second Coming when the world has prepared a place
for Him, and that the first step in readying His arrival is to Christianize
America.<p>
"Christian politics has as its primary intent the conquest of the land
-- of men, families, institutions, bureaucracies, courts, and governments
for the Kingdom of Christ," writes reconstructionist George Grant.
Christian dominion will be achieved by ending the separation of church and
state, replacing U.S. democracy with a theocracy ruled by Old Testament law,
and cutting all government social programs, instead turning that work over
to Christian churches. Reconstructionists also would abolish government
regulatory agencies, such as the U.S. EPA, because they are a distraction
from their goal of Christianizing America, and subsequently, the rest of the
world. "World conquest. That's what Christ has commissioned us to
accomplish," says Grant. "We must win the world with the power of
the Gospel. And we must never settle for anything less." Only when that
conquest is complete can the Lord return.<p>
<h3>Don't Worry, Be Happy</h3>
People under the spell of such potent prophecies cannot be expected to worry
about the environment. Why care about the earth when the droughts, floods,
and pestilence brought by ecological collapse are signs of the Apocalypse
foretold in the Bible? Why care about global climate change when you and
yours will be rescued in the Rapture? And why care about converting from oil
to solar when the same God who performed the miracle of the loaves and
fishes can whip up a few billion barrels of light crude with a Word?<p>
Many End-Timers believe that until Jesus' return, the Lord will provide. In <em>America's
Providential History</em>, a popular reconstructionist high-school history
textbook, authors Mark Beliles and Stephen McDowell tell us that: "The
secular or socialist has a limited resource mentality and views the world as
a pie ... that needs to be cut up so everyone can get a piece."
However, "the Christian knows that the potential in God is unlimited
and that there is no shortage of resources in God's Earth. The resources are
waiting to be tapped." In another passage, the writers explain:
"While many secularists view the world as overpopulated, Christians
know that God has made the earth sufficiently large with plenty of resources
to accommodate all of the people."<p>
Natural-resource depletion and overpopulation, then, are not concerns for
End-Timers -- and nor are other ecological catastrophes, which are viewed by
dispensationalists as presaging the Great Tribulation. Support for this view
comes from an 11-word passage in Matthew 24:7: "[T]here shall be
famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places." Other
End-Timers see suggestions of ecological meltdown in Revelation's four
horsemen of the Apocalypse -- War, Famine, Pestilence, and Death -- and they
cite a verse mentioning costly wheat, barley, and oil as foretelling food
and fossil-fuel shortages. During the End Time, the four horsemen shall be
"given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine and
plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth." Some End-Timers note that
Revelation 8:8-11 predicts a fiery mountain falling into the sea and causing
great destruction, followed by a blazing star plummeting from the sky. This
star is called "Wormwood," which dispensationalists say translates
loosely in Ukrainian as "Chernobyl."<p>
A plethora of End-Time preachers, tracts, films, and websites hawk
environmental cataclysm as Good News -- a harbinger of the imminent Second
Coming. Hal Lindsey's 1970 End-Time "non-fiction" work, <a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/partner?partner_id=25450&amp;cgi=product&amp;isbn=031027771x" target="new"><em>The
Late Great Planet Earth</em></a>, is the classic of the genre; the movie
version pummels viewers with stock footage of nuclear blasts, polluting
smokestacks, raging floods, and killer bees. Likewise, dispensationalist
author Tim LaHaye's "Left Behind" novels -- at one point selling
1.5 million copies per month -- weave ecological disaster into an
action-adventure account of prophesy.<p>
At <a href="http://www.raptureready.com" target="new">RaptureReady.com</a>,
the "Rapture Index" tracks all the latest news in relation to
biblical prophecy. Among its leading environmental indicators of Apocalypse
are oil supply and price, famine, drought, plagues, wild weather, floods,
and climate. <em>RaptureReady</em> webmaster Todd Strandberg writes to
explain why climate change made the list: "I used to think there was no
real need for Christians to monitor the changes related to greenhouse gases.
If it was going to take a couple hundred years for things to get serious, I
assumed the nearness of the End Times would overshadow this problem. With
the speed of climate change now seen as moving much faster, global warming
could very well be a major factor in the plagues of the tribulation."<p>
<a href="http://www.victorious.net/prophecy//index.shtml" target="new">Another
prophecy index</a> points to acts of nature (drought in Ethiopia, famine in
South Africa, floods in Russia, fires in Arizona, heat waves in India, and
the breakup of the Antarctic ice shelf) as proof of the approaching
doomsday, noting that "When these things begin to come to pass, then
look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh"
(Luke 21:28).<p>
According to a <a href="http://www.apocalypsesoon.org/signs.html" target="new">chart</a>
on the End-Time website <a href="http://www.apocalypsesoon.org/english.html" target="new">ApocalypseSoon.org</a>,
we are at "the beginning of sorrows" (Matthew 24:3-8) marking the
Great Tribulation. The site links to a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/371522.stm" target="new">BBC
News</a> article on infectious diseases and a <a href="http://www.heatisonline.org/weather.cfm" target="new">chronicle
of extreme weather events</a> on Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ross
Gelbspan's climate-change website as evidence of those unfolding sorrows.
However, it adds a stern disclaimer regarding these external links: "We

<h3>If I Had a Hammer</h3>
To understand how the Christian right worldview is shaping and even fueling
congressional anti-environmentalism, consider two influential born-again
lawmakers: House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Texas) and Senate Environment
and Public Works Committee Chair James Inhofe (R-Okla.).<p>
DeLay, who has considerable control over the agenda in the House, has called
for "march[ing] forward with a Biblical worldview" in U.S.
politics, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A6825-2001May9&amp;no" target="new">reports
Peter Perl</a> in <em>The Washington Post Magazine</em>. DeLay wants to
convert America into a "God centered" nation whose government
promotes prayer, worship, and the teaching of Christian values.<p>
Inhofe, the Senate's most outspoken environmental critic, is also unwavering
in his wish to remake America as a Christian state. Speaking at the
Christian Coalition's Road to Victory rally just before the GOP sweep of the
2002 midterm elections, he promised the faithful, "When we win this
revolution in November, you'll be doing the Lord's work, and He will richly
bless you for it!"<p>
Neither DeLay nor Inhofe include environmental protection in "the
Lord's work." Both have ranted against the EPA, calling it "the
Gestapo." DeLay has fought to gut the Clean Air and Endangered Species
acts. Last year, Inhofe invited a stacked-deck of fossil fuel-funded
climate-change skeptics to testify at a Senate hearing that climaxed with
him calling global warming "the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the
American people."<p>
DeLay has said bluntly that he intends to smite the "socialist"
worldview of "secular humanists," whom, he argues, control the
U.S. political system, media, public schools, and universities. He called
the 2000 presidential election an apocalyptic "battle for souls,"
a fight to the death against the forces of liberalism, feminism, and
environmentalism that are corrupting America. The utopian dreams of such
movements are doomed, argues the majority leader, because they do not stem
from God.<p>
"DeLay is motivated more than anything by power," says Jan Reid,
coauthor with Lou Dubose of <a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/partner?partner_id=25450&amp;cgi=product&amp;isbn=1586482386" target="new"><em>The
Hammer</em></a>, a just-published biography of DeLay. "But he also
believes in the power of the coming Millennium [of Jesus Christ], and it
helps shape his vision on government and the world." This may explain
why DeLay's Capitol office furnishings include a marble replica of the Ten
Commandments and a wall poster that reads: "This Could Be The Day"
-- meaning Judgment Day.<p>
DeLay is also a self-declared member of the Christian Zionists, an End-Time
faction numbering 20 million Americans. Christian Zionists believe that the
1948 creation of the state of Israel marked the first event in what author
Hal Lindsey calls the "countdown to Armageddon" and they are
committed to making that doomsday clock tick faster, speeding Christ's
return.<p>
In 2002, DeLay visited pastor John Hagee's Cornerstone Church. Hagee
preached a fiery message as simple as it was horrifying: "The war
between America and Iraq is the gateway to the Apocalypse!" he said,
urging his followers to support the war, perhaps in order to bring about the
Second Coming. After Hagee finished, DeLay rose to second the motion.
"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, "what has been spoken here
tonight is the truth from God."<p>
With those words -- broadcast to 225 Christian TV and radio stations --
DeLay placed himself squarely inside the End-Time camp, a faction willing to
force the Apocalypse upon the rest of the world. In part, DeLay may embrace
Hagee and others like him in a calculated attempt to win fundamentalist
votes -- but he was also raised a Southern Baptist, steeped in a literal
interpretation of the Bible and End-Time dogma. Biographer Dubose says that
the majority leader probably doesn't grasp the complexities of
dispensationalist and reconstructionist theology, but "I am convinced
that he believes [in] it." For DeLay, Dubose told me, "If John
Hagee says it, then it is true."<p>
<h3>Onward Christian Senators</h3>
James Inhofe might be an environmentalist's worst nightmare. The Oklahoma
senator makes major policy decisions based on heavy corporate and
theological influences, flawed science, and probably an apocalyptic
worldview -- and he chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works
Committee.<p>
That committee's links to corporate funders are both easier to trace and
more infamous than its ties to religious fundamentalism, and it's true that
the influence of money can scarcely be overstated. From 1999 to 2004, Inhofe
received more than $588,000 from the fossil-fuel industry, electric
utilities, mining, and other natural-resource interests, according to the
Center for Responsive Politics. Eight of the nine other Republican members
of Inhofe's committee received an average of $408,000 per senator from the
energy and natural resource sector over the same period. By contrast, the
eight committee Democrats and one Independent came away with an average of
just $132,000 per senator from that same sector since 1999.<p>
But the influence of theology, although less discussed, is no less
significant. Inhofe, like DeLay, is a Christian Zionist. While the senator
has not overtly expressed his religious views in his environmental
committee, he has when speaking on other issues. In a Senate foreign-policy
speech, Inhofe argued that the U.S. should ally itself unconditionally with
Israel "because God said so." Quoting the Bible as the divine Word
of God, Inhofe cited Genesis 13:14-17 -- "for all the land which you
see, to you will I give it, and to your seed forever" -- as
justification for permanent Israeli occupation of the West Bank and for
escalating aggression against the Palestinians.<p>
Inhofe also openly supports dispensationalist Pat Robertson, who touts every
tornado, hurricane, plague, and suicide bombing as a sure sign of God's
return; who accused both Jimmy Carter and George Bush Sr. of being followers
of Lucifer; and who makes no secret of the efforts of his Christian
Coalition to control the Republican Party, according to Theocracy Watch.<p>
A good fundamentalist, Inhofe scored a perfect 100 percent rating in 2003
from all three major Christian-right advocacy groups, while earning a 5
percent from the League of Conservation Voters (and a string of zeroes from
1997 to 2002). Likewise, eight of the nine other Republicans on the
Environment and Public Works Committee earned an average 94 percent approval
rating in 2003 from the Christian right, while scoring a dismal 4 percent
average environmental approval rating. The one exception proves the rule:
Moderate Lincoln Chafee (R.-R.I.) last year earned a 79 percent LCV rating
and just 41 percent from the religious right.<p>
As committee chair, Inhofe has subtly chosen scripture over science. The
origins of his 2003 Senate speech attacking the science behind global
climate change, for example, reveal his two masters: the speech is traceable
to fossil fuel industry think tanks and petrochemical dollars -- but also to
the pseudo-science of Christian right websites. In that two-hour diatribe,
Inhofe dismissed global warming by comparing it to a 1970s scientific scare
that suggested the planet was cooling -- a hypothesis, he fails to note,
held by only a minority of climatologists at the time. Inhofe's apparent
source on global cooling was the Acton Institute for the Study of Religion
and Liberty, a Christian-right and free-market economics think tank. In an
editorial on that site called "Global Warming or Globaloney? The
Forgotten Case for Global Cooling," we hear echoes of Inhofe's
position. The article calls climate change "a shrewdly planned campaign
to inflict a lot of socialistic restriction on our cherished freedoms.
Environmentalism, in short, is the last refuge of socialism." Inhofe's
views can be heard in the words of dispensationalist Jerry Falwell as well,
who said on CNN, "It was global cooling 30 years ago ... and it's
global warming now. ... The fact is there is no global warming."<p>
Inhofe's views are also closely tied to the Interfaith Council for
Environmental Stewardship, a radical-right Christian organization founded by
radio evangelist James Dobson, dispensationalist Rev. D. James Kennedy of
Coral Ridge Ministries, Jerry Falwell, and Robert Sirico, a Catholic priest
who has been editing Vatican texts to align the Catholic Church's historical
teachings with his free-market philosophy, according to <em>E Magazine</em>.<p>
The ICES environmental view is shaped by the Book of Genesis: "Be
fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it. Have dominion over the
fish of the seas, the birds of the air, and all the living things that move
on this earth." The group says this passage proves that "man"
is superior to nature and gives the go-ahead to unchecked population growth
and unrestrained resource use. Such beliefs fly in the face of ecology,
which shows humankind to be an equal and interdependent participant in the
natural web.<p>
Inhofe's staff defends his backward scientific positions, no matter how at
odds they are with mainstream scientists. "How do you define
'mainstream'?" asked a miffed staffer. "Scientists who accept the
so-called consensus about global warming? Galileo was not mainstream."
But Inhofe is no Galileo. In fact, his use of lawsuits to try to suppress
the peer-reviewed science of the National Assessment on Climate Change --
which predicts major extinctions and threats to coastal regions -- arguably
puts him on the side of Galileo's oppressors, the perpetrators of the
Christian Inquisition, <a href="http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&amp;name=viewprint&amp;articleId=7603" target="new">writes
Chris Mooney</a> in <em>The American Prospect</em>.<p>
"I trust God with my legislative goals and the issues that are
important to my constituents," Inhofe has told <em>Pentecostal Evangel</em>
magazine. "I don't believe there is a single issue we deal with in
government that hasn't been dealt with in the Scriptures." But Inhofe
stayed silent in that interview as to which passages he applies to the
environment, and he remained so when I asked him if End-Time beliefs
influence his leadership of the most powerful environmental committee in the
country.<p>
<h3>And the Cow Jumped Over the Moon</h3>
So weird have the attempts to hasten the End Time become that a group of
ultra-Christian Texas ranchers recently helped fundamentalist Israeli Jews
breed a pure red heifer, a genetically rare beast that must be sacrificed to
fulfill an apocalyptic prophecy found in the biblical Book of Numbers. (The
beast will be ready for sacrifice by 2005, <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/dreher/dreher041102.asp" target="new">according
to <em>The National Review</em></a>.)<p>
It can be difficult for environmentalists, many of whom cut their teeth on
peer-reviewed science, to fathom how anyone could believe that a
rust-colored calf could bring about the end of the world, or how anyone
could make a coherent End-Time story (let alone national policy) out of the
poetic symbolism of the Book of Revelation. But there are millions of such
people in America today -- including 231 U.S. legislators who either believe
dispensationalist or reconstructionist doctrine or, for political
expediency, are happy to align themselves with those who do.<p>
That's troubling, because the beliefs in question are antithetical to
environmentalism. For starters, any environmental science that contradicts
the End-Timer's interpretation of Holy Writ is automatically suspect. This
explains the disregard for environmental science so prevalent among
Christian fundamentalist lawmakers: the denial of global warming, of the
damaged ozone layer, and of the poisoning caused by industrial arsenic and
mercury.<p>
More important, End-Time beliefs make such problems inconsequential. Faith
in Christ's impending return causes End-Timers to be interested only in
short-term political-theological outcomes, not long-term solutions.
Unfortunately, nearly every environmental issue, from the conservation of
endangered species to the curbing of climate change, requires belief in and
commitment to an enduring earth. And yet, no amount of scientific evidence
will likely shake fundamentalists of their End-Time faith or bring them over
to the cause of saving the environment.<p>
"It's like half this country wants to guide our ship of state by
compass -- a compass, something that works by science and rationality, and
empirical wisdom," quipped comedian Bill Maher on <em>Larry King Live</em>.
"And half this country wants to kill a chicken and read the entrails
like they used to do in the old Roman Empire."<p>
Those who doubt the dangers of such faith-based guidance need only recall
the 9/11 hijackers, who devoutly believed that 72 black-eyed virgins awaited
them as their reward in paradise.<p>
In the past, it was not deemed politically correct to ask probing questions
about a lawmaker's intimate religious beliefs. But when those beliefs play a
crucial role in shaping public policy, it becomes necessary for the people
to know and understand them. It sounds startling, but the great unasked
questions that need to be posed to the 231 U.S. legislators backed by the
Christian right, and to President Bush himself, are not the kind of
softballs about faith lobbed at the candidates during the recent
presidential debates. They are, instead, tough, specific inquiries about the
details of that faith: Do you believe we are in the End Time? Are the
governmental policies you support based on your faith in the imminent Second
Coming of Christ? It's not an exaggeration to say that the fate of our
planet depends on our asking these questions, and on our ability to reshape
environmental strategy in light of the answers.<p>
Many years ago, a friend of mine introduced me to his "religious
grandparents," who, whenever they were asked about the future,
proclaimed, "Armageddon's comin'!" And they believed it. Christ
was due back any day, so they never bothered to paint or shingle their
house. What was the point? Over the years, I drove by their place and
watched the protective layers of paint peel, the bare clapboards weather,
the sills and roof rot. Eventually, the house fell into ruin and had to be
torn down, leaving my friend's grandparents destitute.<p>
In a way, their prediction had proven right. But this humble apocalypse, a
house divided against itself, was no work of God, but of man. This is a
parable for the 231 Christian right-backed legislators of the 108th
Congress. Their constituency's cherished beliefs may lead to the most
dangerous and destructive self-fulfilling prophecy of all time.<p>
