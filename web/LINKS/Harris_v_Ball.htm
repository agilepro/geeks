<h1>What Should Science Do?<br>Sam Harris v. Philip Ball</h1>
<p><i>June 23, 2009</i>
<h2>Sam Harris and Philip Ball discuss the conflict between religion and science.&nbsp; They do not agree…</h2>
<p><a href=http://www.philipball.com>Philip Ball</a>
is a freelance science writer. He worked at <i>Nature</i> for over 20 years,
first as an editor for physical sciences (for which his brief extended from
biochemistry to quantum physics and materials science) and then as a
Consultant Editor. His writings on science for the popular press have
covered topical issues ranging from cosmology to the future of molecular
biology. Philip is the author of several popular books on science, including
works on the nature of water, pattern formation in the natural world, colour
in art, and the science of social and political philosophy. Philip continues
to write for <i>Nature</i>’s online news, especially for the editorial
column Muse. He has contributed to publications ranging from <i>New
Scientist</i> to the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Guardian</i>, the <i>
Financial Times</i> and <i>New Statesman</i>. He is the regular science
columnist for<i> Prospect</i> magazine, and also a columnist for <i>
Chemistry World</i> and <i>Nature Materials</i>. He has broadcast on many
occasions on radio and TV, and in June 2004 he presented a three-part serial
on nanotechnology, ‘Small Worlds’, on BBC Radio 4. He is also Science Writer
in Residence at the Department of Chemistry, University College London.
Philip has a BA in Chemistry from the University of Oxford and a PhD in
Physics from the University of Bristol.
<p><h1>DAY 1</h1>
<p>Dear Phil—
<p>Well, we seem to have a tempest in a teapot brewing. You were good enough
to notice the birth of my foundation, The Reason Project, in your column in
<i>Nature</i> (<a title how much reason do you want? href="http://www.reasonproject.org/newsfeed/item/how_much_reason_do_you_want/">“How
much reason do you want?”</a> <i>Nature News</i> 14 May 2009), and I repaid
this kindness by hurling you into the Reason Project Hall of Shame for
perceived indiscretions of rational thought. You then responded to your
confinement on your blog
(<a title whatever you do, don’t call them militant href="http://philipball.blogspot.com/">“Whatever
you do, don’t call them militant”</a> 19 May 2009)—and life on earth has not
been the same since. 
<p>I wonder whether you would like to have a direct exchange on these
issues. I’m not entirely sure where our respective misunderstandings leave
off and our genuine differences of opinion begin, but it might be
interesting for readers to watch us struggle to sort things out. 
<p>Please let me know your thoughts.
<p>Best,
<br>Sam
<p>Sam Harris<br>

<p>=====
<p>Dear Sam,
<p>Thanks for this message. A tempest in a teapot seems an apt way to
express it. I do suspect that most of our disagreement hinges on
misunderstandings rather than genuine differences, although of course
there’s no harm in the latter.
<p>I can appreciate that you wouldn’t welcome the mildly skeptical tone of
my <i>Nature</i> article, but I’m still puzzled about why you found it
sufficiently objectionable to (as you say) hurl it into your Hall of Shame.
(I assume this particular pit is not intended for all critics, but only for
those whose message you find especially abhorrent or misguided.) At this
point, I’m forced to guess that perhaps you share the views of those who
have commented unfavourably about the piece on your site. The primary
objections there seem predicated on two notions:
<p>1. That I have said religion and science are compatible.<br>
2. That I am parading Francis Collins and others who seek a conciliatory
position as the good guys.
<p>I sincerely believe that you will find neither of these points of view
actually stated in my piece, and for the simple reason that I don’t believe
them. Perhaps my blog post made it a little clearer. My points are that:
<p>1. There seems little point in making religion per se the ‘enemy of
reason’. That creates a big and, frankly, invincible foe. And it’s a foe
that doesn’t need to be vanquished. Plenty of religious people – certainly,
just about all those I know – are perfectly happy to accept the tenets of
science that the fundamentalists find so distasteful, which are mostly
connected with questions of origin. That there are logical inconsistencies
in that position really doesn’t seem to me to be a big deal – we live with
all kinds of contradictions, and often because we don’t feel any compulsion
to chart our all beliefs with philosophical rigour until we discover where
they clash. For many Christians (the religious community I am most familiar
with), the Virgin Birth, the biblical miracles, as well as angels, saints
and, goodness knows, even heaven and hell aren’t notions they particularly
cling to or think about very much at all. They simply find that religion
addresses some of their needs. I’m not even sure that I would consider this
use of religion irrational – merely woolly.<br>
This is what I meant when I referred to a ‘false dichotomy’ – the fact
that I think science and religion can in principle coexist (as they always
have done, even if not always comfortably) does not mean that I think they
are logically compatible. I know some will say that this is a complacent
view, because religion is (outside Western Europe) growing both in its
strength and in its intolerance. That is absolutely a cause for concern. But
it doesn’t pit religion per se against science per se. It’s a primarily
political issue.
<p>2. Religion is not a delusion to be corrected with a little hard science.
A lot of the current ‘rationalist’ criticism of religion reminds me of the
old deficit model that used to motivate the Public Understanding of Science
movement: just give people the right facts, and then they’ll agree with us.
This is not just deluded, but lazy. It’s trivial to take religious texts and
show how, literally interpreted, they are utter nonsense. But we have to
engage with (and sometimes do battle with, it is true) religion as it exists
in the world. This is more challenging. On the longer version of my <i>
Nature</i> article posted on my blog, I cite the example of Galileo. If we
choose to believe that the Catholic Church condemned his heliocentrism
because it conflicted with scripture, we have an unassailable case against
superstitious dogma. If we recognize that the issue was at least as much
about maintaining the Church’s authority, we have to concede some
(Machiavellian) rationality in the papal position, however repugnant the
motives. (And incidentally, let’s please not hear any more about Giordano
Bruno being martyred for his heliocentrism. That’s the kind of contempt for
history that polarized positions encourage.)<br>
I claim that religion needs to be seen as a social construct, with all kinds
of social functions. Some of the most thoughtful commentators on theology,
such as Karen Armstrong, recognise the value and perhaps even necessity of
the kind of myth that religion embodies. Many are now happy to accept that
aspects of the Bible, and other religious texts, should be read in this
allegorical way. We can’t meaningfully engage in religion without
recognizing this social and cultural aspect - it often functions as a
component of how people construct their cultural identity. It seemed to me
that this was really what the Royal Society’s former director of education
Michael Reiss was trying to say when he suggested that it was best to
understand religiously motivated delusions such as creationism as world
views rather than as mere ignorance. Reiss’s remarks incited such outrage
among a few vocal, prominent scientists that he was of course forced to
resign. It troubles me when scientists (and others) get such horrors about
religion that they seem no longer able to entertain or even notice any
nuance of opinion in these matters. It all starts to sound disturbingly like
George W. Bush’s comment that you’re either for us or against us. 
<p>The comments on your blog left me dismayed that the initiative you have
started might tend to attract those whose views on religion are instead of
the most simplistic and reductive sort (‘But it’s just wrong!’). But I also
realise, on reflection, that it is unfair to judge an organization by its
web feedback. <i>Nature</i> would not fare at all well if that were applied
to them.
<p>I am in favour of any movement that campaigns to kick out of schools the
invidious misinformation of creationism, intelligent design and the rest of
the shoddy fundamentalist agenda. I am very much in favour of a movement
that aims to denounce religious intolerance and that attacks the kind of
harmful and ignorant nonsense that seems increasingly to be coming from the
Vatican. On my blog, I reacted to your actions and to the comments on your
site with a mixture of amusement and irritation, neither of which is
terribly constructive, because I have to choose words carefully within the
incredibly constrained format that a <i>Nature</i> Muse allows and so am
frustrated when they aren’t read carefully. But it is possible too that I
did not choose them carefully enough. And certainly, I would not want to
misrepresent what you are trying to achieve, which I am sure includes much
that I would support.
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Phil
<p><h1>DAY 2</h1>
<p>Dear Phil—
<p>Thank you for a favorable and very substantive response to my invitation.
I appreciate your willingness to have this exchange in a public forum.
First, I should say that while I can’t necessarily endorse every comment
that appears beneath your article on the Reason Project website (in fact,
there may be many I haven’t read), I suspect there is not much daylight
between me and some of the more vociferous critics you encountered there. As
evidence of this fact, here is the Letter to the Editor I wrote in response
to your column. While I am its principal author, many members of my advisory
board have read it, offered minor suggestions, and generally approve its
contents. I have told your Editor in Chief, Philip Campbell, that he can
print it with multiple signatories, or not, whichever is more attractive to
him.
<blockquote>
<p>Sir—<br>
In his column, “How much reason do you want?” (<i>Nature News</i> 14 May
2009) Philip Ball, a consultant editor at this journal, takes members of
The Reason Project to task for being too critical of religion. While he
accepts the value of “knowledge”, “learning,” and “intellectualism,” he
argues that these virtues need not, in principle, undermine the
religious commitments of law-abiding men and women in the 21st century.
Mr. Ball assures us that while the “abuse” of religion “to justify
suppression of human rights, maltreatment and murder is abhorrent,”
there is no deeper contradiction to be found between scientific
rationality and religious faith. As evidence of this underlying harmony,
we are asked to contemplate the existence of The BioLogos Foundation,
whose purpose (in the words of its mission statement) is to demonstrate
“the compatibility of the Christian faith with what science has
discovered about the origins of the universe and life.” <br>
To give you a sense of how bizarre Mr. Ball’s opinions will appear to
rational people everywhere, imagine reading a column in <i>Nature</i>
that criticized scientists for taking too adversarial a stance with
respect to witchcraft—even in Africa, where a belief in the efficacy of
magic spells, invisible spirits, and the occasional human sacrifice
remains widespread. If the analogy between religion and witchcraft seems
hyperbolic, please take a moment to review the actual tenets of the
world’s major religions. 
<p>For instance, a reconciliation between science and Christianity (the
explicit goal of The BioLogos Foundation) would mean squaring physics,
chemistry, biology, and a basic understanding of probabilistic reasoning
with a raft of patently ridiculous, Iron Age convictions. In its most
generic and well-subscribed form, Christianity amounts to the following
claims: Jesus Christ, a carpenter by trade, was born of a virgin,
ritually murdered as a scapegoat for the collective sins of his species,
and then resurrected from death after an interval of three days. He
promptly ascended, bodily, to “heaven”—where, for two millennia, he has
eavesdropped upon (and, on occasion, even answered) the simultaneous
prayers of billions of beleaguered human beings. Not content to maintain
this numinous arrangement indefinitely, this invisible carpenter will
one day return to earth to judge humanity for its sexual indiscretions
and sceptical doubts, at which time he will grant immortality to anyone
who has had the good fortune to be convinced, on Mother’s knee, that
this baffling litany of miracles is the most important series of
truth-claims ever revealed about the cosmos. Every other member of our
species, past and present, from Cleopatra to Einstein, no matter what
his or her terrestrial accomplishments, will (probably) be consigned to
a fiery hell for all eternity.
<p>On Mr. Ball’s account, there is nothing in the scientific worldview,
or in the intellectual rigor and self-criticism that gave rise to it,
that casts such convictions in an unfavorable light. This learned
opinion is, frankly, amazing to me and to the other members of The
Reason Project. One would have thought it might also amaze Mr. Ball’s
fellow editors at <i>Nature</i>.<br>

<p>I suspect that you find this response indicative of the some of the
misunderstandings and militancy you refer to in your blog post. I’m sorry to
say, however, that your subsequent writings—both on your blog and in this
exchange—only dig the hole I perceive you to be in deeper still.
<p>On your blog you say the following:
<blockquote>
<p>But what depresses me is that the Reason Project and many of its
supporters are so sure of the battle-lines that they have lost the
ability of basic English comprehension. It is this that has earned me
the delightful honour of a place in the Reason Project’s Hall of Shame,
no less – because it has decided that I am placing the irenic BioLogos
Foundation, the Templeton Foundation, and other apologists, on a
pedestal, making them the nice, friendly good guys who only want us all
to get along. Does my article say that? No, it simply quotes from the
BioLogos mission statement (just as it quotes from the Reason Project
mission statement). That this is taken as registering approval is a bit
disturbing. The fact that I suggest the Reason Project in some respects
‘should be applauded’, and say no such thing about the BioLogos
Foundation, doesn’t seem to be noticed. (The fact is that I’m utterly
indifferent to the BioLogos Foundation. I find its aims uninspiring and
its current statements about the relation of science and religion
somewhat shallow.)
</blockquote>
<p><br>While you clearly expect a paragraph like this to fully acquit you, there
is, even here, much to offend the sensibilities of reasonable people who are
sensitive to the problem of religion. Please consider how your choice of
words strikes a reader who desperately wants to believe that you, a
scientist and an editor at the most prestigious scientific journal on earth,
has his head on straight:
<p>1. To call the BioLogos Foundation “irenic” is far too charitable. It is,
rather, obscurantist and phatasmagorically stupid. If you took a moment to
examine what its founder, Francis Collins, actually believes, as well as the
means by which he came to believe it, you will see that he is engaged in an
obscene re-branding of otherworldly hope and craving as a legitimate arm of
science. I’m sorry to say that your charity toward Collins is part of a
pattern at <i>Nature</i>, which I have
<a href="http://www.samharris.org/images/uploads/448864a.pdf">pointed out
previously</a> in the pages of the journal. According to <i>Nature</i>,
Collins’ atrocious book, <i>The Language of God,</i> represented a “moving”
and “laudible” exercise of building “a bridge across the social and
intellectual divide that exists between most of US academia and the
so-called heartlands.” And here is Collins, hard at work on that bridge:
<blockquote>
<p>As believers, you are right to hold fast to the concept of God as
Creator; you are right to hold fast to the truths of the Bible; you are
right to hold fast to the conclusion that science offers no answers to
the most pressing questions of human existence; and you are right to
hold fast to the certainty that the claims of atheistic materialism must
be steadfastly resisted….
<p>God, who is not limited to space and time, created the universe and
established natural laws that govern it. Seeking to populate this
otherwise sterile universe with living creatures, God chose the elegant
mechanism of evolution to create microbes, plants, and animals of all
sorts. Most remarkably, God intentionally chose the same mechanism to
give rise to special creatures who would have intelligence, a knowledge
of right and wrong, free will, and a desire to seek fellowship with Him.
He also knew these creatures would ultimately choose to disobey the
Moral Law.
</blockquote>
<p>Half of the American population believes that the universe is 6,000 years
old; our president had just used his first veto to block federal funding for
the most promising medical research in all of biology on religious grounds;
and one of the foremost scientists in the land had that to say. Stranger
still, the most influential scientific publication on earth couldn’t find a
nit to pick here. Collins’ scientific reputation has been undiminished by
these ejaculations—indeed, he seems destined to be President Obama’s choice
to run the National Institutes of Health—and yet his thinking here, as
elsewhere, is a quite a bit worse than “woolly,” as you put it: it
constitutes a perfect repudiation of scientific principles and intellectual
honesty. 
<p>2. The way in which you paired The Reason Project and The BioLogos
Foundation in your <i>Nature</i> column conveyed the sense—quite common in
journalism—that the truth must lie somewhere between the two extremes on
offer: On the one hand we have some extreme rationalists (who think that
most basic standards of intellectual integrity should not be traduced at the
highest levels of our discourse out of deference to the uneducated opinions
of first century scribes); on the other, we have a man who is convinced that
Jesus Christ is the risen Lord and eternal saviour of the earth because he
happened to come upon a frozen waterfall while hiking and found it
inexplicably beautiful. These two frames of mind are not equally scientific.
I think you owe it to yourself, and to your readers, to clearly distinguish
them.
<p>There was much else in your column, blog post, and first volley here,
that I have not addressed—of particular interest to me is the claim that
religion is both an “invincible” and unnecessary foe. Perhaps we’ll touch on
that subject later on.
<p>Best,<br>
Sam
<p>=====<p>
Dear Sam,<br>
I’m a little clearer now about what I’m being accused of, but no more so
about why. Your letter to <i>Nature</i> repeats the claim that I say there
is no contradiction between scientific rationality and religious faith, and
repeats the failure to state where I say that. In fact, I state in my
previous response that there are contradictions. Can we accept at least that
this charge should be substantiated or dropped? That seems to me to be the
rational way to proceed.
<p>Your account of Christianity’s ‘most generic and well subscribed’ form is
the scriptural literalist one. It is probably close to the medieval view,
but I’d want more evidence that it is the generic view today. It is not the
view of the head of the Church of England, which I suspect should count for
something. But in any event, my point is, and always was, not that we need
accept religious (and in your portrait, undoubtedly nonsensical) views as
compatible with science but that you are not going to get very far by simply
insisting to people who hold them that they are irrational and therefore
should be abandoned forthwith. Rather, you need to consider the sociological
questions of why people have a range of religious faiths, why religions as
social institutions are so widespread, and why fundamentalism seems to be
becoming a powerful political force in some religions in some parts of the
world. (I don’t believe there is a universal answer to the last one – look
at the resurgence of Hinduism in India, for example.)
<p>To call the Biologos Foundation irenic is to use the word in its literal
sense – they seek reconciliation of science and religion. It is simply a
description, not a judgement. It may well be that no such reconciliation is
logically possible – that doesn’t mean the Biologos Foundation cannot seek
it, however misguidedly. There is not the slightest reason why one cannot be
irenic for phantasmagorially stupid reasons. And then you’re off again,
making criticisms of positions that simply don’t appear in my article.
Criticize <i>Nature</i>’s other statements on Collins by all means – they
are nothing to do with me or my views.
<p>You end with a further supposition – that by describing two polar
positions, I am suggesting that the truth lies in between. That’s your
interpretation, and based on nothing I said. My view (and it’s not hard to
see this, I think, from the strapline of my article) is that a more
productive way to approach the issues lies elsewhere.
<p>Sam, you’re calling yourselves the Reason Project and repeatedly
stressing your scientific perspective. Science proceeds by inspecting the
evidence objectively, not by prejudging what it means. The evidence here are
the words I wrote, but they don’t seem to have been terribly germane to your
comments so far.
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Phil
<h1>DAY 3</h1>
<p>Dear Phil –
<p>You still appear to be missing the point: the point is not that there is
some legalistic parsing of your <i>Nature</i> column that allows for an
(almost) exculpatory reading; the point is that everything you have written
on this subject represents a basic failure to acknowledge (1) just how
contradictory religious faith and scientific rationality are as modes of
thought, (2) the actual profundity and scope of humankind’s religious
bewilderment in the year 2009, and (3) the real world effects of (1)&amp;(2).
The most charitable interpretation I can find of what you have written is
this: such truths could well be acknowledged, if we thought it wise—but it
is not wise. If one wants to slay the Dragon of Ignorance, one shouldn’t
first wake the Dragon, offend it, and then challenge it to fight to the
death; one must be more cunning than this, or the whole project is doomed
from the start. If THIS is what you intend to say, then fine, we can debate
questions of secular/scientific strategy and marketing (and perhaps your own
writing is an attempt to implement such a subtle strategy). But much of what
you’ve written suggests that, whether or not you are chiefly concerned about
such practical matters, you are also confused about points 1-3.
<p>First off, the generic form of Christianity I described in my Letter to
the Editor is not merely “the scriptural literalist one.” Without question,
the beliefs I’ve highlighted summarize the majority view of Christianity.
You seem to be, frankly, unaware of what most Christians (and perhaps
religious people generally) claim to believe. Even your reference to the
Church of England (which, I will grant, is more liberal than many) seems to
ignore its actual doctrine. The C of E wears the resurrection of Jesus and
other hocus pocus right on its
<a title="sleeve" href="http://www.cofe.anglican.org/faith/christian/">
sleeve</a>. More generally, I could cite any number of opinion poll results
and the doctrinal statements of the largest churches—all would conduce to
the general boredom our readers, but would establish, beyond peradventure,
that Christianity without a belief in miracles and magic books is not
Christianity. And for everything that I would say about Christianity, there
is worse to be said about Islam at this moment in history, as you surely
must know.
<p>As for your actual words, here is a quotation from your <i>Nature</i>
piece, with some trivial modifications. I wonder if you see anything wrong
with it:
<blockquote>
<p>In other words, this is not a matter of science versus faith [in
witchcraft], but of the rejection of scientific ideas that challenge
power structures… That’s not to minimize the problem, but recognizing it
for what it is will avoid false dichotomies, and perhaps make it easier
to find solutions.
<p>So there is little to be gained from trying to topple the temple [of
Magic] — it’s the false priests who are the menace. If we can recognize
that [witchcraft], like any ideology, is a social construct — with
benefits, dangers, arbitrary inventions and, most of all, roots in human
nature – then we might forgo a lot of empty argument and get back to the
worldly wonders of the lab bench.
</blockquote>
<p><br>
Wouldn’t it be a tad strange to read this in the pages of <i>Nature</i>?
Doesn’t it matter what people believe about the nature of reality? Doesn’t
the nature of reality itself matter? If the basic claims of religion are
true, the scientific worldview is so blinkered and susceptible to spiritual
modification as to render the whole enterprise ridiculous. If the basic
claims of religion are false, most people are living in a state of abject
confusion, beset by absurd hopes and fears, and tending to waste their time
and attention—often with tragic results. Is this really a “false dichotomy”?
<p>Best,<br>
Sam
<p>=====<p>
<p>Dear Sam,<br>
You accuse me of “a basic failure to acknowledge just how contradictory
religious faith and scientific rationality are as modes of thought”. Given
what I have said previously, I must now interpret this as your way of saying
“you acknowledge that religious faith and scientific rationality are
contradictory, but fail to say that loudly enough”. (We needn’t argue
further about whether my original <i>Nature</i> article said otherwise; my
words can speak for themselves.)<br>
So it seems that my sin, perhaps more venial than mortal, is not that of
defending religion but of failing to attack it with sufficient vigour. This,
you say, is a position that “will appear bizarre to rational people
everywhere”. I will trust rational people everywhere to be the judge of
that. You seem very keen to construct statements that <i>Nature</i> readers
will find bizarre, but I think most will not find at all bizarre the notion
that it is not science’s duty to eradicate all traces of religion in the
world. This is not in any degree a weird or fringe position and it seems a
pointless game to find ways of making it appear such.
<p>From what you say, I suspect that what you object to most is my
suggestion that the contradictions between science and faith need not in
themselves be a big deal. By this I mean that I see no need to be so
desperately worried about them when religious leaders and believers are
moderates rather than are not scriptural literalists. I see no great threat
to science from the kind of Anglicanism advocated by its current leader, or
from the liberal forms of Islam that are held by thinkers such as Ziauddin
Sardar. There are plenty of people, including many scientists, who are quite
able to live with (or open to exploring) the contradictions and feel no need
to rewrite or deny the mainstream scientific consensus. And these people
are, in my experience, not at all “living in a state of abject confusion,
beset by absurd hopes and fears”. It hardly needs to be said that science
can thrive in societies in which religion is present (perhaps even strong) –
it has done so throughout all of history. 
<p>That is why I don’t feel a need to cast this in terms of science versus
faith. It seems to me that our difference here is that you feel unwilling to
live in a world where the contradictions between science and faith are
tolerated, whereas I am not.
<p>So I see no dragon that needs slaying, either by might or by stealth. If
you accept that anthropology is anything of a science, this monolithic view
of religion is in any event unscientific. Are you really saying that
Christian fundamentalism, Indonesian Buddhism, African tribal beliefs and
Chinese state-sponsored Confucianism are all part of the same beast, with
the same causes and the same vulnerabilities? All, I agree, entail
irrationality to some degree or another, and all are (as I’ve said) social
constructs. But the reasons why, let’s say, fundamentalist Islam is in the
ascendant in some parts of the world, and Hindu nationalism in others, are
social, cultural and political. You might say that, regardless of the
causes, the kinds of problems that ensue would be removed by simply
eradicating all religion everywhere. But I don’t think you’d be so naïve.
<p>I find your approach of highlighting and ridiculing all the most absurd
and irrational aspects of these belief systems too easy. I too find the
things you list as irrational (albeit perhaps not always as offensive) as
you do. But the problems that religions can cause will be addressed only by
engaging with them as social and cultural institutions, not as a string of
silly ideas.
<p>I did not say (sorry, this again) that the C of E shares none of the
views you listed in your sketch of Christian belief. I said that its
position is not that which you sketched, particularly in terms of the part
that I suspect we both (and most other non-believers) find most
objectionable: “Every other member of our species, past and present, from
Cleopatra to Einstein, no matter what his or her terrestrial
accomplishments, will (probably) be consigned to a fiery hell for all
eternity.” Neither this nor a creationist viewpoint is an essential or
inevitable component of Christianity today. If those beliefs are
nevertheless on the rise (I simply don’t know if they are – creationism has
always been strong in the US), then that is a problem with societal causes
and needs to be seen and tackled as such.
<p>Your minor rephrasing of my <i>Nature</i> article makes for interesting
reading. To begin with, I’d challenge your implication that all religion is
witchcraft – but before you leap down my throat, I do so because I would say
instead that it is more accurate and more productive to say that religions
and witchcraft are both examples of social constructs based on beliefs and
ideologies that cannot be demonstrated and that, among other things,
formalize social structures and hierarchies. Like it or not, it seems to be
part of human nature to create such constructs. And they are not always
expressed as religion.
<p>With that in mind, I see nothing at all objectionable in the second
paragraph. Benefits of witchcraft? There are very probably social benefits
for the societies that practise it. They don’t necessarily outweigh the
problems, and they don’t in any way justify witchcraft. But they help
explain it, and we won’t understand these superstitious systems unless we
recognize them.
<p>I think that actually the meaning of my first paragraph remains pretty
much unscathed too. The point here is that all kinds of irrational belief
systems will accept a great deal of science, but some selectively reject
those aspects that conflict with their power base. So all I am saying is
that, strategically speaking, it seems to make sense to recognize a
distinction between ideologies that systematically deny all of science (I’m
not in fact sure if there are any such) and ones that exclude only the
inconvenient truths. It seems to me that those two positions are likely to
have different origins, and thus warrant different solutions.
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Phil
<p><h1>DAY 4</h1>
<p>Dear Phil –
<p>I trust that many of our readers will share my frustration at this point,
as well as my sense that we have failed to get at the heart of the matter.
As is so often the case in debates of this kind, more points get raised in
each volley than can be addressed in the next—so permit me to ignore what
seem like peripheral issues in an attempt to make some sense.
<p>I will say one thing in passing, however, by way of addressing several
specific points (your use of the term “irenic”, etc.): you frequently
complain that I have either misrepresented what you have written or have
drawn the wrong implications from it. While it is tempting to argue
otherwise, it is too tiresome to rebut each specific charge. There is
another principle at work that I think you should notice: our disagreement
draws at least as much energy from what you have not said. To use an
admittedly crude example: if the only thing a person can think to say about
the morality of Adolph Hitler is that he was a “committed vegetarian,” this
would say rather more by way of omission. In your <i>Nature</i> column, and
in this exchange, what you haven’t said matters more than you seem to
realize.
<p>I am not suggesting that it is “science’s duty to eradicate all traces of
religion in the world.” Nor am I denying that science can be practiced
alongside religion (in most forms), or that religious people can become
scientists, or that smart scientists can sometimes harbor incredible
religious beliefs, or that religious imbeciles can hanker after the products
of science. Clearly, a juxtaposition between bad ideas/methods and good ones
is possible—in a single brain, in an institution, in a culture, etc. And as
far as science itself is concerned, it has become all too obvious that many
scientists practice their discipline like a trade, without ever attempting
to form a truly consilient, or even consistent, view of the world. 
<p>But the fact that such things are possible does not in the least suggest
that they are optimal—or, indeed, that they do not come at a terrible price.
I think it would be very difficult to find instances where incoherence,
wishful thinking, and dogmatism have aided scientific progress—or, in fact,
progress of any kind. The argument that there is no deep conflict between
scientific rationality and religious faith because some scientists are
religious, and all religious people value some science, is a false one—and
it has become a stultifying shibboleth. Is there generally no conflict
between marriage and adultery simply because the two are so often found
together? Would it matter if the BioLechery Foundation produced adulterers
who could attest, without blinking, to their clarity of conscience? The
analogy isn’t perfect, but perhaps you see my point. The cuckold,
incidentally, is not merely science itself, but everyone everywhere, and
those yet unborn. Who knows how much better our world would be if we had
birthed a culture of genuine intellectual honesty in the year 1200 (or
2000)?
<p>So the fact that you find yourself surrounded by scientists and other
smart people who may be a little “woolly” on the subject of God is evidence
of absolutely nothing worth discussing (on my account), apart from the fact
that it seems to have led you to miss the bigger picture and to speak and
write in such a way as to give shelter to the deeply religious, powerfully
irrational, and shockingly retrograde convictions of entire cultures and
subcultures. This is not (as you have charged) to paint religion with a
broad brush. I am very quick to distinguish gradations of bad ideas; some
clearly have no consequences at all (or at least not yet); some put
civilization itself in peril. The problem with dogmatism, however, is that
one can never quite predict how terrible its costs will be. To use one of my
favorite examples, consider the Christian dogma that human life begins at
the moment of conception: On its face, this belief seems likely to only
improve our world. After all, it is the very quintessence of a
life-affirming doctrine.
<p>Enter embryonic stem-cell research. Suddenly, this “life begins at the
moment of conception” business becomes the chief impediment to medical
progress. Who would have thought that such an innocuous idea could
unnecessarily prolong the agony of tens of millions of people? This is the
problem with dogmatism, no matter how seemingly benign: it is unresponsive
to reality. Dogmatism is a failure of cognition (as well as a commitment to
such failure); it is the state of being closed to new evidence and new
arguments. And this frame of mind is rightly despised in every area of
culture, on every subject, except where it goes by the name of “religious
faith.” In this guise, parading its most grotesque faults as virtues, it is
granted a special dispensation, even in the pages of <i>Nature</i>.
<p>Your frequent claim that we must understand religious belief as a “social
construct,” produced by “societal causes,” dependent upon “social and
cultural institutions,” admitting of “sociological questions,” and the like,
while it will warm the hearts of most anthropologists, is either trivially
true or obscurantist. It is part and parcel of the double standard that so
worries me—the demolition of which is the explicit aim of The Reason
Project.
<p>Epidemiology is also “social construct” with “societal causes,” etc.—but
this doesn’t mean that the germ theory of disease isn’t true or that any
rival “construct”—like one suggesting that child rape will cure AIDS—isn’t a
dangerous, deplorable, and unnecessary eruption of primeval stupidity. We
either have good reasons or bad reasons for what we believe; we can be open
to evidence and argument, or we can be closed; we can tolerate (and even
seek) criticism of our most cherished views, or we can hide behind
authority, sanctity, and dogma. The main reason why children are still
raised to think that the universe is 6,000 years old is not because religion
as a “social institution” hasn’t been appropriately coddled and cajoled, but
because polite people (and scientists terrified of losing their funding)
haven’t laughed this belief off the face of the earth. 
<p>We did not lose a decade of progress on stem-cell research in the United
States because of religion as a “social construct”; we lost it because of
the behavioural and emotional consequences of a specific belief. If there
were a line in the book of Genesis that read – “The soul enters the womb on
the hundredth day (you idiots)” – we wouldn’t have lost a step on stem-cell
research, and there would not be a Christian or Jew anywhere who would worry
about souls in Petri dishes suffering the torments of the damned. The
beliefs currently rattling around in the heads of human beings are some of
the most potent forces on earth; some of the craziest and most divisive of
these are “religious,” and so-dubbed they are treated with absurd deference,
even in the halls of science; this is a very bad combination—that is my
point. 
<p>For the purposes of this discussion, the only “social construct” that I
am worried about is the one which convinces a journal like <i>Nature</i>
that its paramount duty is to be polite in the face of Iron Age delusions.
If ever there were a place to call a spade a “spade,” it is in the pages of
the world’s most authoritative scientific publication. Let me remind you
that the physiologist Rupert Sheldrake had his scientific career neatly
decapitated, in a single stroke, by a <i>Nature</i> editorial. Did his
vaguely “woolly” thesis about “morphogenetic fields” deserve at least a ride
in a tumbrel? Perhaps. Was his book, A New Science of Life, as flagrantly
unscientific as Francis Collins’, The Language of God? Not by a long shot.
As I have pointed out, the journal’s treatment of Collin’s risible theology
has been abject. You’ve also cited Ziauddin Sardar with admiration—but his
whitewash of Islam in the pages of <i>Nature</i> was a travesty. Here again
is the “social construct” and the double standard that you fail to
acknowledge. Religion is probably the most consequential and divisive
species of ignorance at work in the world today, and yet it is
systematically shielded from criticism, even where it explicitly conflicts
with science, and even in the world’s most important scientific journal.
Amazing.
<p>Of course, all that you have written is of a piece with the inertia felt
in the rest of the scientific community: most scientists are simply out of
touch with the religious infatuations that rule the better part of humanity;
when in touch, they can’t be bothered to take them seriously. I have met
anthropologists who will say, with a straight face, that no one in the
Muslim world actually believes in martyrdom, and no jihadist has ever blown
himself up with an expectation of entering paradise: it’s all politics and
terrestrial grievances and “social constructs” and “societal causes” as far
as the eye can see. A quip by Steven Weinberg comes to mind (said in
reference, I think, to post-modern critiques of science): “You have to be
very learned to be that wrong.” Indeed, one does—and many are. If there is
anything good that can be said about the Bible-thumpers in my country, it is
that they understand that the Muslim world is ablaze with old-time religion.
Needless to say, devout Muslims return the favor. It is the scientists,
secularists, and religious moderates—still licking their spoons of Karen
Armstrong’s latest pabulum—who are so often confused, mistaking even their
confusion itself for wisdom.
<p>Best,<br>
Sam
<p>=====<p>
<p>Dear Sam,
<p>From what you say, it seems that my article tapped into a reservoir of
ill will towards <i>Nature</i> on this issue. Perhaps that explains some of
the vehemence of your response. But I am not in any sense speaking ‘for’ <i>
Nature</i>, and any views the journal has published on these matters in the
past were not mine.
<p>In any case, I think we are (this may surprise you) agreed on the nature
of the problem in some respects. That’s to say, I share your view that many
of the alleged ‘facts’ that comprise most religious belief – the existence
of a deity (or deities), that deity’s capacity to intervene in the world in
supernatural ways, the whole paraphernalia of miracles, afterlife, saints,
sin, absolution, virgin births, resurrections – are not just outside of
science but fundamentally incompatible with a scientific view of the world.
And while some agnostics might insist that we cannot ‘know’ that a god does
not exist, this does not compel us to give the ‘for’ and ‘against’
possibilities equal weight. We shouldn’t imagine things into being without
good reason to do so.
<p>Where we part company is largely (though not entirely) over the practical
question of what is the appropriate response to all this. If I have
understood it correctly, your view is that, while science need not embark on
a crusade to wipe out religion, scientists should at every opportunity
criticize religious belief for being a groundless fantasy that encumbers
people with false hopes and obstructive (even destructive) dogma. My view is
that science need not feel so threatened by religion. Clearly, science
sometimes has been and is explicitly threatened and hindered by religion –
the stem-cell issue is one such. But I don’t regard this as inevitable
(after all, by no means all Christians were opposed to stem-cell research).
When scientific advance is blocked because of superstitious beliefs, we
should be unequivocal in condemning that (and elsewhere I have done so).
However, I believe that sometimes resistance to new technologies and
research has come from religious quarters for ethical reasons that one might
also hold as an atheist, and which are defensible even if I don’t agree with
them. So we need to consider those distinctions carefully.
<p>You say it would be very difficult to find instances where ‘incoherence,
wishful thinking, and dogmatism have aided scientific progress—or, in fact,
progress of any kind.’ I’m not sure whether you mean to include all
manifestations of religious faith as part of this ‘incoherence, wishful
thinking, and dogmatism’, but one can certainly make a case that religion
has sometimes played a role in promoting a scientific outlook. Since the
time of William of Conches in the twelfth century, some people have
considered it a religious duty to explore and understand ‘God’s creation’.
It seems quite likely that one’s objectivity in doing that is likely to be
ultimately compromised if one insists on continuing to see it as God’s
creation; but as it happened, this exploration, initiated as a religious
imperative, in the end found ever less use for God. Similarly, the value
accorded to scientific learning in the Muslim world in the eighth to the
twelfth centuries drew some impetus from the interpretation of Islam then in
favour. 
<p>You might say ‘But wouldn’t have it been even better if people had
studied science without reference to God at all?’ But this, as well as your
suggestion that we might have ‘birthed a culture of genuine intellectual
honesty in the year 1200’, seems to me ahistorical. I can think of no
plausible route from the embers of the Roman Empire to the Enlightenment
that would not have been centred in Christianity (unless the Muslims had
conquered Europe, perhaps – but that was never really their wish). I’m not
wishing to make religion the champion of free thought here (God forbid), but
only to suggest that the issues are more complex than you seem to want to
allow.
<p>Moreover, there is plenty of non-religious dogma that has hindered
science too – think of Lysenkoism and the Nazis’ criticisms of ‘Jewish
science’. I realise that of course you will deplore these too – but my point
is that if, by some bizarre circumstance, Europe had ditched religion in
1200, I’m not sure we could necessarily expect the state of knowledge to be
any better today than it is. Some other social construct seems likely to
have come along and foiled the Baconian utopia. That, sadly, is what we
humans do.
<p>I think we also differ in that you are more of an idealist – perhaps more
of an optimist – and I am more of a realist. I think that religion, or
ideologies that are mostly indistinguishable from it, are a part of human
society. I feel that science needs to find ways of working with that. And I
say this not as a defeatist statement of resignation, but just as a
recognition of the nature of humanity. I happen to feel – in fact, I am
fully confident of it – that religion has made positive contributions to the
human condition, as well as unambiguously negative ones. You might again
argue that those things, such as charity, can and do exist without religion,
and this is surely true. But to my mind, religion is for many people an
expression of the very human impulses that allow us to be (for example)
charitable. In any event, I suspect that we can no more expect to eliminate
religion (or something like it) from society than we can eliminate music.
<p>If that is the case, I feel that science does need to find some way of
working alongside religion rather than pouring scorn on it at every
opportunity. The relationship doesn’t have to be cosy and convivial, and
indeed I think in general it will be, and probably should be, a tense one.
But I believe it can be good enough to prevent us from having to tilt at
windmills. I agree with you that there should be no reason to handle
religion with kid gloves for fear of offending. But neither do I see a need
to thrash it like a furious parent, vilify it as though it were a loathsome
criminal, or deride it as idiotic. I think we can afford to treat some
aspects of religion in a forthright yet adult-to-adult fashion.
<p>Perhaps the crux of the matter is your statement that, although the
coexistence of science and religion in societies and in individuals is of
course possible, it ‘does not in the least suggest that they are optimal—or,
indeed, that they do not come at a terrible price.’ There is a great deal of
distance between those two possibilities. If it is simply ‘not optimal’, it
doesn’t seem a big deal. If it comes at a terrible price, we should worry. I
suspect that both of those things, and all others in between, have applied
at different times and places.
<p>Incidentally, your ‘Hitler’ analogy sounds rather compelling until you
consider that what you’re saying seems more like the following: rather than
say ‘Hitler was German chancellor from 1933 to 1945’, one is always obliged
to say ‘Hitler (in my opinion a vile and deranged antisemite) was chancellor
from 1933 to 1945’. What is not said doesn’t always imply a particular point
of view.
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Phil
<h1>DAY 5</h1>
<p>Dear Phil –
<p>I think we may be seeing the first rays of daylight. As I suspected, our
dispute seems to be mostly about practical issues—When should we be
scrupulously honest? How can science be best communicated given the state of
popular opinion? Etc.—with regard to which intelligent people can have
differences of opinion, while sharing the same a worldview. This is not to
say that our differences of opinion are inconsequential. I happen to think
that that the approach you advocate generally splits the baby and is
currently doing much harm to the integrity of science. Perhaps I should
mention in this context that I have just heard back from your employer
regarding my letter to the editor. It was declined (with a form letter).
While I don’t want to read too much into this, let me tell you why <i>Nature</i>’s
behavior amazes me (and should amaze our readers) and how it exemplifies
many of the problems we have been discussing:
<p>1. Philip Campbell (<i>Nature</i>’s Editor in Chief) contacted me
personally in response to your article’s inclusion in The Reason Project
Hall of Shame. He wrote to say that, as your views did not represent those
of the journal, we appeared to be condemning <i>Nature</i> for printing
“individual points of view.” This complaint struck me as something less than
a masterpiece of candor, given <i>Nature</i>’s repeated coddling of religion
and the fact that you are not just any scientist; rather, you are a
“consultant editor for <i>Nature</i>” (and had been a physical sciences
editor there for over a decade). But okay, I thought, perhaps I was wrong to
assume that your column might in some way reflect the current position of
the journal. Needless to say, I told Mr. Campbell that I was overjoyed that
he published “individual points view.” Perhaps, he would consider printing
another—and then I appended my letter to the editor. 
<p>2. In submitting this letter to Campbell, I made it clear that some of
the most prominent scientists on the Reason Project advisory board had
contributed to it and were eager to sign it as co-authors, if this would
make it more attractive to him from a publishing point of view. I didn’t
name names, but I more or less gave him his pick of a dozen 800 lb gorillas.
Campbell told me that the journal would be back in touch soon. 
<p>3. Weeks passed. You were kind enough to check on the letter’s fate and
learned that there was some speculation on <i>Nature</i>’s part about
whether our debate-in-progress might make such a letter “redundant.”
Nevertheless, you heard that it might still be published, perhaps with a few
edits.
<p>4. This morning, some nameless correspondence editor or intern (email
address = correspondence@nature.com) sent me a form letter regretting that
my letter could not be published due to “limited space.” There was no offer
of publication on <i>Nature</i>’s website.
<p>So, here is where we stand: <i>Nature</i>‘s editors have just rejected a
strongly worded letter written, as far as they know, by any possible
combination of RP advisors. Again I don’t want to read too much into this,
but given that we are talking about some of the most influential scientists
and public intellectuals around, I find this a pretty remarkable editorial
decision. Needless to say, “limited space” is euphemism—especially given the
possibility of publication on the Internet. 
<p>It seems to me that there is still something that you (and Campbell)
haven’t quite absorbed about the problem with, as you say, “working
alongside religion.” By remaining politely silent and hoping to just get on
with its work, the culture of science has enabled religious delusions of all
kinds—because whenever it opens its mouth, all (real) religion claims to
describe reality as it is. Silence in the face of these assertions is
generally indistinguishable from assent. Of course, intellectual apathy on
the part of individual scientists and their leading journals would be a bad
thing all on its own, but add to this the advocacy of organizations like the
Templeton Foundation, which uses its 1.5 billion dollar endowment to
carefully blur the line between reason and faith, and the effect is an
almost a total ceding of the argument in favor of religion. 
<p>Here is an example of “working alongside religion” in practice. You may
remember that <i>Nature</i> recently published an editorial that read like a
press release for the Templeton Foundation: 
<p><a title="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v454/n7202/full/454253b.html" href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v454/n7202/full/454253b.html">
http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v454/n7202/full/454253b.html</a>
<p><a href="http://www.reasonproject.org/images/uploads/Templeton.pdf">
Download PDF</a>
<p>While it included a few mumbled lines about the difference between
science and religion, the piece amounted to an almost giddy endorsement of
John Templeton and the work of his foundation. Indeed, the greatest sin
attributed to the Templeton foundation was that it sometimes supports areas
of research deemed “marginal” by some scientists. And the examples <i>Nature</i>
chose to highlight—positive psychology and cosmological theories that posit
multiple universes—are, it seems to me, perfectly respectable fields of
inquiry. The editorial included several unctuous and embarrassing assertions
about John Templeton being “deeply spiritual” and inspired by “his love of
science and his God”—as though statements of this kind begged no questions
at all from the point of view of science. In its effort to keep “working
alongside religion” (again, your phrase), <i>Nature</i> counselled “strict
atheists” (who, by implication, must be outliers in the scientific
community) to just “happily ignore” Templeton. The journal concluded that
“critics’ total opposition to the Templeton Foundation’s unusual mix of
science and spirituality is unwarranted.” While I can imagine Campbell felt
he had struck a deft balance here, all things considered, this editorial
constituted as forthright an act of fellatio as Templeton could have ever
hoped to receive from the world’s leading scientific journal. 
<p>The Templeton Foundation’s work is quite a bit more insidious (and
clever) than funding marginal research, or even obscenely silly projects
like Collins’ BioLogos Foundation. Two examples of their work should
suffice:
<p>1.
<a title="http://www.templeton.org/evolution/" href="http://www.templeton.org/evolution/">
http://www.templeton.org/evolution/</a>
<p>2.
<a title="http://www.templetonprize.org/currentwinner.html" href="http://www.templetonprize.org/currentwinner.html">
http://www.templetonprize.org/currentwinner.html</a>
<p><br>
Templeton’s recent advertisement about evolution (1. above), which appeared
in almost every major newspaper and magazine in the United States,
represents a very clever manipulation of scientific opinion. When faced with
the question “Does Evolution Explain Human <i>Nature</i>?” even I would have
said something like “Not entirely.” Of course, Templeton knows that most
people will only read the titles of these essays. The general effect of the
page is to communicate the inadequacy of evolutionary theory and the
perpetual incompleteness of science—and to encourage readers to draw the
further the inference that one needs religion/faith to get all the way home
to the Truth. It is an especially nice touch that the one unequivocal “Yes”
comes from the journalist Robert Wright, who has become a committed
apologist for religion. (Leave it to Francis Collins to deliver the
eminently reasonable, “Not entirely.”) Thus, whichever door one opens in
this fun house of obfuscation, one finds a message that is comforting to
religion. An earlier ad entitled “Does the Universe Have a Purpose?” played
the same game with a carefully picked sample of respondents. Out of 12
responses, only two were direct answers of “No.” Glancing at the ad, one
could only conclude that atheism must be a minority opinion in science.
These ads amount to religious propaganda, pure and simple. And the Templeton
foundation has spent millions of dollars on them (Full disclosure: I was
asked to participate in an earlier series of ads, where I was told that the
entire campaign would consist of one page of my heresy set against one page
written by Francis Collins, to be placed in every major newspaper and
magazine in the land. I declined.)
<p>The d’Espagnat citation (2. above) produces a similar effect, at
nauseating length. I’m not in a position to quibble with d’Espagnat’s
science, nor do I intend to impugn him as a recipient of the Templeton
Prize. But this citation represents another instance of religious
propaganda. Reading it, one is given to understand that d’Espagnat would
throw the full weight of his scientific reputation behind the following
assertions: there is a hidden reality; science can’t quite glimpse it;
religion offers a glimpse of its own; thus, religion and science are
complimentary—but religion is likely the deeper of the two. Of course, the
juxtaposition of a brilliant scientist and the “world’s largest annual award
given to an individual” makes the Templeton Foundation appear both very
important and intellectually credible. Whereas, in reality, all they are is
a great pot of money surrounded by some very “woolly” ideas.
<p>How is it possible that Campbell doesn’t see the problem with all this?
Why wouldn’t <i>Nature</i> feel that it was editorially bound to draw the
CLEAREST POSSIBLE distinction between real science and ancient delusions?
After all, <i>Nature</i> fancies that it can distinguish groundbreaking
science from merely pedestrian science—publishing the only former. Why can’t
it see that there is a distinction of much greater consequence to society,
and to the future of science, that it should also make: there is a
difference, after all, between having good reasons for what one believes and
having bad ones. Incidentally, this is the only distinction one needs to
become a “strict” atheist.
<p>All of this runs to the larger issue of intellectual honesty. Perhaps we
can define “intellectual honesty” as the ratio between what a person has
good reason to believe and what he will assert to be true. In the ideal
case, this number would equal 1, and in science it approaches as near to 1
as it does anywhere in human discourse. It seems to me that most religions
subsist, and even thrive, on values that can be brought arbitrarily close to
zero for centuries on end—and, indeed, grow smaller the longer any religious
authority speaks about content of the faith. This disparity between what
counts for honesty in serious discourse, depending on the topic, is as
strange as it is consequential. Is it really so “idealistic” to think that a
journal like <i>Nature</i> might object to it?
<p>Best,<br>
Sam
<p>=====<p>
Dear Sam,<br>
I’m glad that you see ‘some rays of daylight’, by which I take you to mean,
if not convergence then at least understanding of our positions. I’d like to
feel that it should always be possible to be scrupulously honest in these
matters, as well as polite as far as is warranted – I’m not sure there
should ever be reason to hold back from saying to a religious believer ‘I
feel there is no credible evidence for what you believe’ (so long as they
don’t have a gun in their hand). But neither do I feel an obligation to say
that at every opportunity, or to think that the debate ends there.
<p>Incidentally, I note that I will no doubt be seen as one of those
atheists who Richard Dawkins laments under the rubric
<a title="‘I’m an atheist but…’" href="http://richarddawkins.net/article,318,Im-an-atheist-BUT---,Richard-Dawkins">
‘I’m an atheist but…’</a>. But I’m not bowled over by Richard’s responses to
the five variants he lists. For example, in suggesting that religion is a
social construct I might be construed as a Type 1: “I’m an atheist, but
religion is here to stay. You think you can get rid of religion? Good luck
to you! You want to get rid of religion? What planet are you living on?
Religion is a fixture. Get over it!’ That is (I hope this is clear by now)
not at all how I’d put it, and frankly I don’t know whether it is ‘here to
stay’ or not (who could?). I simply observe that since time immemorial human
societies have organized themselves into hierarchical systems based on more
or less arbitrary tenets, of which religions are a prominent example. That’s
what we’re dealing with. I think this is probably a more productive way to
regard the situation than to think that humans are ritualistically
inculcated into stupidity for which a dose of cold reason is the cure. (It’s
a shame, incidentally, that Richard doesn’t really address this position,
but just caricatures it.)
<p>And let’s not forget that, however much you might disagree with my
position, it makes me closer to your own than Darwin was. (There is no
tenable defence of the idea that he called himself an ‘agnostic’ rather than
an atheist merely to spare people’s feelings.) But I don’t figure on seeing
Darwin in your Hall of Shame any time soon…
<p>It’s a pity that <i>Nature</i> rejected your letter, not least because
that issue clearly preoccupied you in your last response. The problem is
that I am not <i>Nature</i>, nor a spokesperson for <i>Nature</i>, nor in
any way disposed to defend its decisions. The matters you cite had nothing
to do with me. And while it is true that both Phil Campbell and I feel there
is something to be said for ‘working alongside religion’, I don’t intend
this to mean ‘remaining politely silent and hoping to just get on with its
work’. I simply feel we need to choose our battles. And while you suggest
that the distinction between science and religion is that of ‘having good
reasons for what one believes and having bad ones’, I would disagree. By
‘good reasons’, you presumably mean ones that can be logically defended on
the basis of objective evidence. I know plenty of religious people who
believe because it helps them in life and makes them feel better. That seems
a pretty good reason to me, even if I don’t share the view. (I hope it’s
clear that, if ‘good reasons’ like that lead people to deny evolution or
refuse blood transfusions, my magnanimity soon evaporates. I guess that
makes me one of those British empiricists.) 
<p>I’ll say this about the <i>Nature</i> decision, however. I’m not a fan of
form letters, although I worked long enough as an editor to understand the
occasional need for them. My problem is that, as you say, they are
euphemistic and often give little clue to the real reasons for a decision. I
simply don’t know what the reason was in this case – it may really have been
‘limited space’, for all I know (for indeed space is limited). But I wish
that had been made more explicit. However, bear in mind that it is almost
unheard of for a letter about an opinion piece published only online to be
given even a moment’s consideration for the print journal – normally the
position is that the online-only content is completely separate from the
print content, and so the latter does not carry comment on the former. Bear
in mind also that you do not need permission to comment on the website – the
feedback facility is open to all. (I suspect, however, that you were
thinking in terms of something more than that.) There is also the
consideration that the editors knew you intend to put some form of our
dialogue online, and may feel that this will address the matter more
adequately and comprehensively than a letter might have.
<p>I was happy to help discover what <i>Nature</i> intended to do with your
letter, but otherwise had no role in the decision (nor would it have been
proper that I did, of course). I confess, however, to being a little
surprised that you wanted to press on with having it published in the light
of this exchange, which I feel has shown that your criticisms fall on a
somewhat different target to the one the appears in your letter. I had hoped
to assiduously avoid revisiting the issue, but the fact is that you have
never refuted my argument that the letter misrepresents and misinterprets
what I said, however much you continue to feel that I let religion too
lightly off the hook. I’d be interested to know if any of ‘the most
influential scientists and public intellectuals around’ would be inclined to
defend putting their names to the letter in the light of this. I have deep
respect for the scientists on your board, and would consider myself to be on
warm terms with several of them – but even the most weighty of thinkers have
to justify their positions. 
<p>All the best,<br>
Phil
<h1>DAY 6</h1>
<p>Dear Phil –
<p>Perhaps I was wrong about that daylight… 
<p>In any case, I think our debate has run its course. I’ve participated in
enough of these exchanges to no longer be surprised when a proper meeting of
the minds fails to occur. But I must say that my feelings of futility and
boredom are always compounded, in a way that I fear will be shared by many
of our readers, whenever I find myself grappling with the vapors of “I’m an
atheist but…” The problem with this view—which I agree, well summarizes your
own—is that it so often takes the form of simply missing the point. In fact,
“I’m an atheist but…” generally represents a commitment to missing the
point—as it derives most of its content from simply not seeing what all the
fuss is about. Such obliviousness can always be given a positive spin (“we
need to choose our battles”), but there is no escaping the fact that yours
is the perspective of one who does not quite see the depth and scope of the
problem. This position is easy enough to maintain: all one need do is avert
one’s eyes. Indeed, the “I’m an atheist but…” school generally believes that
ignoring the problem of religion is the wisest course of action (some call
this “realism”). I hope it does not seem ad hominem when I say that your
view of these matters strikes me as intellectually lazy—but it is lazy in
the extreme. There is a certain genius in laziness, however, as it can never
be proven wrong. Or, rather, it can never be made to notice when it has
been, again and again. 
<p>While I have little hope of getting through to you at this late hour, I
should address a few points in closing: First, you seem to view my focus on
<i>Nature</i>’s accommodation of religion as some kind of personal obsession
and a distraction from the subject of our exchange. Here you have, I’m
afraid, missed the point of our exchange (or at least missed my point in
initiating it). In my view, your article was remarkable and worth debating
for two reasons: (1) it appeared in <i>Nature</i>, and (2) it represented a
further instance of <i>Nature</i>’s blinkered appeasement of religion. The
point I have made repeatedly, and will now make one final time, is that it
really matters that the world’s most influential scientific journal seems
both deluded about religion and committed to remaining so. Had your article
appeared in the Guardian, there would have been no reason for us to have
this debate. (While I find it depressing, I actually expect a newspaper like
the Guardian to pander to religion.) 
<p>Secondly, the fact that you can unselfconsciously assert that people
believe in one or another religious doctrine “because it helps them in life
and makes them feel better” and then say that this “seems a pretty good
reason” to you indicates how little you have thought about the conflict
between religion and science. If I told you that I believed that the H5N1
virus will never become a pandemic, or that string theory will be fully
vindicated in the near future, or that complex life first developed on Mars
and was later transferred to earth, and I gave as my reason for holding
these beliefs that each “makes me feel better,” I am confident that your
response would not be this “seems a pretty good reason to me.” Don’t you see
how bizarre it is to accept such shoddy thinking with respect to the
existence of a personal God or the divine origin of a specific book? A
person cannot (or least should not be able to) believe something because it
“makes him feel better.” The fact that people occasionally do manage such
contortions is what renders phrases like “self-deception,” “wishful
thinking,” “experimenter bias,” etc., so important to keep on hand. Please
notice that these phrases describe how it looks from the outside when people
believe a proposition because “it makes them feel better.” Please also
notice that this frame of mind represents a failure of cognition and
reasoning that all sane people decry in every area of serious discourse but
one. 
<p>A world in which people believe propositions merely because these
propositions “make them feel better” is a world gone utterly mad. It is a
world of private and irreconcilable epistemologies. It is a world where
communication, even on the most important issues—perhaps especially on the
most important issues—is guaranteed to fail. Of course, you have tried
arrest your slide into the abyss in your parenthetical remark about
evolution and blood transfusions—but one can draw no such boundary unless
one draws it based on some deeper principle. You cannot say that a person’s
reason for believing in the virgin birth is “good” just so long as this
belief has no negative consequences on his behavior. Whether a belief is
well founded or not has nothing to do with its consequences. 
<p>Generally speaking, for a belief to be justified, our acceptance of it
must be dependent upon its actually being true (and not be dependent upon
how its being true would make us feel). Needless to say, the preceding
sentence does not suffice as full account of epistemology: uniting both
science and commonsense and reconciling their frequent disagreements. But
there can be no doubt about the difference between a belief that is overtly
motivated by emotional bias (and other non-epistemic factors) and a belief
that is comparatively free of such bias. I wonder if we will live to see the
day when scientists and their leading journals might be counted upon to
recognize this difference without having to be pilloried by “strict”
atheists.
<p>Your blithe acceptance that belief can be something other than
epistemic—something other than an effort to reliably map reality in our
thoughts—makes it impossible to differentiate belief from mere hope. I’m
sure many people you know hope that there is a God; they hope that they will
see their friends and loved ones after death; they hope that their lives are
aligned with some larger cosmic purpose; and they are disposed to make much
of this hope—to celebrate it, and to gather with others who hope for these
same things. Your friends might say that this hope has enriched their lives
or has in some way become indispensable to their functioning in the world.
But if these friends of yours are really religious—that is, really
conforming to the doctrine of Christianity, Islam, Judaism, etc.—they will
have taken a further step toward delusion and mistaken this hope for a form
of knowledge. They may have yanked their bootstraps this way: “How could I
find this hope so consoling if it were not, in fact, well founded? Perhaps
this feeling of hopefulness itself attests to the truth of thing hoped for…
Praise be to God!” Of course there are many other ways to chase one’s tail
under the aegis of religion. Such “woolly” thinking is enabled by the fact
that it almost never meets resistance, even from scientists (who, as we
know, must “choose their battles”). It should be abundantly clear, however,
that mere hope does not constitute knowledge, no matter how lovingly one
tends it and props it up in the wind.
<p>In your last email you summarize the situation as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>I simply observe that since time immemorial human societies have
organized themselves into hierarchical systems based on more or less
arbitrary tenets, of which religions are a prominent example. That’s
what we’re dealing with. I think this is probably a more productive way
to regard the situation than to think that humans are ritualistically
inculcated into stupidity for which a dose of cold reason is the cure.
</blockquote>
<p><br>It is amazing that you can advance this as a serious position. First off, it
is undeniable that most humans are “ritualistically inculcated into
stupidity” from birth onwards by their religious parents. Second, it is a
perverse (and highly condescending) article of faith among secular academics
that people can never be reasoned out of their religious convictions. I have
heard from literally thousands of people who used to belief in the God of
Abraham—indeed, many used to be scriptural literalists—who were stripped of
their faith after a proper collision with Reason. It is quite possible for
people to notice how “woolly” their thinking has been, how they were part of
a culture grown incandescent with lies, how their parents and elders raised
them in a near total vacuum of critical thinking and in complete ignorance
of the scientific worldview. Indeed, I once had the pleasure of having
dinner with a woman could pinpoint the very moment she lost her faith, as it
had been purged from her mind that morning while reading one of my books.
Her overwhelming feeling was of regret for all the time she had wasted over
the course of her life. No doubt such a terrific sense of sunk cost keeps
many people stuck to a pew. Perhaps not everyone can be reasoned out of his
or her faith—but the problem is that we don’t know how fully people’s minds
could change because we haven’t really tried (please don’t feel tempted to
make yet another tendentious excursion into history and bring up the French
Revolution or the gulag). You’d do well to notice how easily children can be
reasoned out of their belief in Santa Claus. The all enter school as devout
believers, and they all exit as perfect sceptics. How is this dialectical
miracle accomplished? Quite simply: there is no cultural support for a
belief in Santa past a certain age, and no one likes to be laughed at. Do we
replace Santa Claus with anything? No. We just oblige people to grow up.
<p>In any case, the problem isn’t that human societies are organized in
“hierarchical systems based on more or less arbitrary tenets” (can you
really be serious? It is rare to find such a crystalline example of academic
cant. I think you’d be wise to remove the letters H-I-E-R-A from your
keyboard for a while). The problem is that intellectual honesty is still a
very scarce commodity in our world; we are rather bad at producing it, and
it is taboo to even try once the conversation turns to the subject of God.
<p>I realize that my tone of chastisement has probably grown very tedious
and could be mistaken for hostility. But I can’t help but feel that there is
a great asymmetry between our points of view – both in how fully they have
been thought out and in their degree of the moral seriousness. I see the
perpetuation of ancient tribalism and ignorance (read “religion”) to be a
grave problem, and the source of much unnecessary suffering in the world;
you claim that the problem is either not very serious or that it is
unavoidable—in either case there is not much to be done. You do not seem to
see what an astonishing number of the world’s conflicts and missed
opportunities arise from people’s false knowledge about God, and when
specific instances are pointed out to you, you deem them to be inevitable
(if it’s not religion it would be something else), or you defensively say,
well of course I object to that instance of religious stupidity: parents
shouldn’t withhold blood transfusions from their children!... But the truth
is, a comprehensive response to the problem of religious ignorance is
possible, and a piecemeal response is totally unprincipled and bound to seem
so. Our world has be shattered, and is reliably shattered anew with each
subsequent generation, by irreconcilable claims about God and his magic
books. Until we stop enabling these competing delusions—by our silence and
by our silly attempts to change the subject—we will have no one to blame but
ourselves when medieval ideas come crashing into public life—as they do, and
will, to our great detriment.
<p>But enough… As I said at the outset, I sincerely appreciate your
willingness to debate these issues at length. I remain hopeful that
exchanges like this are useful (for someone, somewhere, sometime), whether
or not the participants themselves budge an inch.
<p>Thanks for your time, Phil. I wish you all the best,
