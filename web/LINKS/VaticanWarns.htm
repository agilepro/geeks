<h1>Vatican Warns Against Increasingly Healthy Attitude Toward Sex</h1>
VATICAN CITY--Alarmed by rising rates of pleasurable,
mutually fulfilling acts of physical love among Catholics, the Vatican
issued a statement Monday warning against healthy attitudes toward sex.<p>
"The practice of so-called 'healthy sexuality,' with its emphasis on
the spiritual and physical nourishment of consenting partners in a
relationship built on mutual respect, has no place in the Holy Roman
Catholic Church," the 200-page document read. "Those who have
derived pleasure from such non-shame-based practices are not living
according to God's law."<p>

The Vatican statement cited 183 different "wholly sinful" sexual
acts, including the discrete, occasional manipulation of one's own
genitals for pleasure; intercourse positions designed to heighten
sensations of ecstasy; and intimate, post-coital cuddling and conversation
with a loved one outside the bounds of the marital bed.<p>
The statement also listed 244 phrases which are regarded as blasphemous
when uttered in a non-procreative context. Among them: "God, your
breasts are beautiful," "I feel so complete when you're inside
me," and "I love to watch your belly rise and fall after we make
love."<p>
Church officials were quick to praise the Vatican's denouncement of
"the brutal transgression against God that is the enjoyment of sex
for its own sake."<p>
"In recent years, Catholics the world over have been exposed to a
multitude of sexual practices that, if not resisted, could enrich their
lives and deepen their enjoyment of their partners," said Cardinal
Joaquin Navarro Valls, speaking on behalf of the pope. "As Catholics,
we must remain vigilant, doing everything in our powers to resist such
urges. Only the Lord's divine redemption can transform sex into a force
for goodness by limiting it to the joyless context of married couples who
wish to procreate."<p>
"The position of the Church is absolute: If two people who are not a
married couple endeavoring to have children engage in tension-relieving,
life-affirming sex, they are committing a grave sin," Archbishop
Edward Egan of New York said. "There is nothing holy about people
feeling good about their bodies and themselves."<p>
Catholics are taking the condemnation of modern sexual mores to heart.<p>
"In the seven years we've been married, my wife and I have probably
had sex about 1,500 times," said Lowell, MA, resident Bill Metz, 36.
"We're extremely attracted to each other, and satisfying each other
physically is something we've always enjoyed. Until now, that is. I
finally see that what we thought was a fun way to celebrate our love was
really an expression of hostility and disrespect toward Jesus."<p>
Metz added that he and his wife plan to have at least 15 children as
penance for their physical indulgences.<p>
"This is a major step forward for the church," said Father
Thomas Mallory, Deacon of Boston's Our Lady Queen of Peace. "We've
seen too much healthy sexuality among Catholics in recent years, which
inevitably led to an unholy sense of well-being and contentment.
Hopefully, this papal condemnation will put a stop to that."<p>
