<font face="Georgia" size=3>"Dale McGowan has
assembled an invaluable sourcebook on an issue that
must be of great concern to everyone but narrow
dogmatists.&nbsp; How do we raise our children to think
for themselves on religious and ethical questions?
Can we avoid religious indoctrination without
inoculating our children against religion? As a
parent, as the pastor of diverse congregation, as a
freethinker, and as a counselor to mixed-faith
couples, I have had occasion to think much on these
questions.&nbsp; So have the contributors to this fine
volume.&nbsp; Here you will find real help."<br>

<font face="Georgia" size=3>Bringing up children
without religious influence seems daunting.&nbsp; Despite
the difficulties, a large and growing number of
parents are choosing to raise their kids without
religion.&nbsp; According to the 2001 American Religious
Identification Survey, 14% of respondents identified
themselves as non-religious.&nbsp; Dale McGowan, editor of
<b><i>PARENTING BEYOND BELIEF: On Raising Ethical,
Caring Kids Without Religion</b></i> (AMACOM; April 26,
2007; $17.95, paperback), estimates that seven
million non-religious parents are raising children
in the U.S. today and doing so with limited
resources.</font><p>
<font face="Georgia" size=3>In <b><i>PARENTING BEYOND
BELIEF</b></i>, more than 30 contributors celebrate the
freedom that comes with raising kids without formal
indoctrination and advise parents on effective ways
to raise caring, independent, and open minded
children.&nbsp; As McGowan observes, "This book is
intended to support and encourage those who, having
already decided to raise their children without
religion, are in search of that support and
encouragement."</font><p>
<font face="Georgia" size=3>From the humorous
"Little Bessie Would Assist Providence" to the
poignant, "Dealing With Death in the Secular
Family," these contributions offer guidance on the
common issues parents find themselves facing
everyday.&nbsp; Here parents will also find wise guidance
on such topics as being and doing good, meaning and
purpose, questioning, the wonder of science, and
seeking community.&nbsp; Sensitive and timely,<b><i>
PARENTING BEYOND BELIEF</b></i> is the first book to
show parents that they can raise independent,
ethical children with confidence and without fear.</font>
