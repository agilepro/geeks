Syria</a>, Feb. 4 (AP) — Thousands of Syrians enraged by caricatures of
Islam's revered prophet torched the Danish and Norwegian embassies in
Damascus on Saturday — the most violent in days of furious protests by
Muslims in Asia, Europe and the Middle East.<p>In Gaza, Palestinians marched
through the streets, storming European buildings and burning German and
Danish flags. Protesters smashed the windows of the German cultural center
and threw stones at the European Commission building, the police said.
<p>Iraqis rallying by the hundreds demanded an apology from the European
Union, and the leader of the Palestinian group Hamas called the cartoons "an
unforgivable insult" that merited punishment by death.
<p>Pakistan summoned the envoys of nine Western nations in protest, and
Europeans took to the streets in Denmark and Britain.
<p>At the heart of the protest: 12 caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad first
published in Denmark's Jyllands-Posten in September and reprinted in
European media in the past week. One depicted the prophet wearing a turban
shaped as a bomb with a burning fuse. The paper said it had asked
cartoonists to draw the pictures because the media was practicing
self-censorship when it came to Muslim issues. The drawings touched a nerve
in part because Islamic law is interpreted to forbid depictions of Muhammad.
<p>In a statement Saturday, the White House condemned the attacks on the
embassies, saying, "We stand in solidarity with Denmark and our European
allies in opposition to the outrageous acts in Syria today." At the same
time, the White House criticized the Syrian government for not protecting
the embassies better.
<p>Denmark's prime minister, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, has said repeatedly that
he cannot apologize for his country's free press. But other European leaders
tried Saturday to calm the storm.
<p>Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said she understood Muslims were hurt
— though that did not justify violence. "Freedom of the press is one of the
great assets as a component of democracy, but we also have the value and
asset of freedom of religion," Mrs. Merkel told an international security
conference in Munich.
<p>The Vatican deplored the violence but said certain provocative forms of
criticism were unacceptable. "The right to freedom of thought and expression
cannot entail the right to offend the religious sentiment of believers," the
Vatican said in its first statement on the controversy.

Jack Straw</a> of Britain, who has criticized European media for reprinting
the caricatures, said there was no justification for the violence in
Damascus.
