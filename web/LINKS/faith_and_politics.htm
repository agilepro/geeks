<font face="Tahoma"><h1 align="center">Why Faith and Politics Don’t Mix</font></h1><font face="Tahoma">by Klaus Brauch
<p align="justify">Given George W. Bush’s frequent and fervent exclamations
of piety and faith in God’s approval of his cause, it’s not too surprising
that support for the President’s agenda is strongest among the conservative
and religious right wing. But the majority of the American public, unlike the
citizens of all other developed nations, continues to trust the President and
give their approval for a unilateral war against Iraq. There can be only one
explanation for this. Recent polls and the 2000 census indicate that most
Americans claim to be devoutly religious and their faith leads them to equate
Christian beliefs with ethics and morality. This perception is so strong that
over 40% of Americans polled now believe that Saddam Hussein was behind the
9/11 attacks, a claim, which even the Bush government has never made.
<p align="justify">The volume of so-called "God Talk" emanating from
the White House, Attorney General Ashcroft, and others in the administration,
has raised alarms with many civil libertarians and constitutional critics who
see it as a front for tearing down the constitutional walls between church and
state in America. These fears are justified since public trust in the
Christian ethic is so strong that the public, Congress, and the Senate have
meekly accepted the dramatic curtailment of American civil liberties brought
about by Mr. Ashcroft and his Patriot Act.
<p align="justify">The argument that devout Christians can do no evil and
operate with the blessing and possibly even at the behest of God’s higher
authority has far more serious implications when applied to the context of
international relations and the prospects of a pre-emptive war against Iraq.
But the belief that strong religious convictions are an assurance of ethical
or legal behavior doesn’t mesh with either historical fact or with logic.
<p align="justify">God’s blessings and support have been used as
justification for everything from the divine right of Kings, to the unleashing
of the Crusades. Blindly trusting and following leaders who claim that God is
on their side, leaders like Hitler as one example, has proven to be unwise at
best and catastrophic at worst. The world has had more than its share of
religious wars and probably the vast majority of human conflict can be laid at
the doorstep of misguided faith, much of it Christian. We need to remember
that "God is Great" and "God Bless America" are two
equally fervent views by devout believers on opposite sides of the same bloody
confrontation.
<p align="justify">The true domain of religion should be to establish a moral
template for each individual’s personal and private code of behavior.
According to Jesus, meaningful prayer was meant to be conducted in private
between the individual and God. "And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be
as the hypocrites [are]: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and
in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men." Mat 6:5.
Private, meaningful prayer is clearly the opposite of the public displays of
piety that we see daily from America’s leaders.
<p align="justify">Sadly, too many wars have been launched in the name of
religion or, even worse, in support of one religion against another. Only
recently have civilized people sought to establish a moral basis for war, to
justify it as a necessary instrument of policy, to ensure peace, provide
security or defend the innocent against oppression. War is terrible, but
clearly belongs within the domain of politics, the realm of Caesar, not of
Christ. Jesus admonished all of us that we should "Render to Caesar the
things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's., Mar
12:17" Attaching a religious cause to this war is unwarranted, unprovable
and not morally justifiable. Additionally, it raises innumerable questions
about whose policies and what motives are really being hidden under the veil
of religious propriety.
<p align="justify">America’s moral position in the world has been attained
at great cost in blood, sweat and tears, but attacking Iraq first and without
UN approval would do much to destroy the nation’s standing in the
international community. It’s not as if America has never waged a
pre-emptive war. The 500 year war to subdue the indigenous peoples of North
America has left a stain on our nation’s history. The Spanish American war
was another example of trumped up causes, "manifest destiny" and
imperialism run amok. Some recent history has been kinder to America’s
reputation of course. The First, Second, Korean and Bosnian wars were noble
endeavors, fought in self-defense or on behalf of undeniably just causes. Our
claims to demand freedom and justice for the world’s people are in large
part based on the legal and moral nature of our involvement in these
conflicts.
<p align="justify">To maintain moral leadership of the world community,
however, America needs not only to proclaim human rights, freedom and fairness
for everyone, but we need to practice these principles as well. The decision
to go to war in the Middle East must be made in the context of indisputable
legality, factual correctness, and with the full consent of the international
community. Masking our war with Iraq in pious pronouncements while sending
shifting and confusing messages about our motives will only serve to destroy
our hard earned reputation as a just and ethical people. Saddam Hussein may be
evil and his regime illegitimate in the eyes of peace loving people
everywhere, but until he strikes the first blow or proves to be indisputably
in the act of attacking others, there is no justification for a pre-emptive
strike.
<p>This week, Archbishop Desmond Tutu commented that "President George W.
Bush is a man of faith. We can only hope that he believes in law as
well." This was a startling observation for a man of the cloth. In short,
even some spiritual leaders agree that Mr. Bush and his team need to set aside
their religious zeal and base their decision for action in the gulf on the
facts and international consensus alone. Anything else will be just another
example of why faith and politics make a deadly and undesirable mix.
