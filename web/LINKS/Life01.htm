<p><b>NATURAL SELECTION 1858</b>
<p>Charles Darwin and Alfred Russell Wallace both
independently arrived at the theory of evolution by
natural selection. They first presented their ideas
together in 1858. In 1859 Darwin published his
monumental work, “On the Origin of Species by Means of
Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races
in the Struggle for Life.”
<p><b>PRINCIPLES OF HEREDITY 1866</b>
<p>Gregor Mendel published his research on peas, laying
the foundation for the study of genetics. The work,
which would not be recognized until the turn of the
century, revealed how traits are passed from generation
to generation, providing a crucial missing piece of the
workings of evolution.
<p><b>THE MODERN SYNTHESIS 1940s</b>
<p>A number of scientists, including Theodosius
Dobzhansky, left, brought together the young field of
genetics, the historical view of paleontology, and the
theory of evolution by natural selection to come up with
a unified view of the evolutionary process. The modern
synthesis has since served as the basic framework for
all of evolutionary biology.
<p><b>STRUCTURE OF DNA 1953</b>
<p>On April 25, 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick
published “A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid” in
Nature. Their discovery changed the science of biology
at least as much as Darwin and Wallace’s theory of
natural selection. From that discovery have come the
sequencing of entire genomes, including that of humans,
and the molecular biology revolution, which provided
powerful tools for all of biology — evolutionary biology
included.
<p><b>CONTINENTAL DRIFT 1960s</b>
<p>In 1915, Alfred Wegener published the theory of
continental drift, which suggested that over time the
continents had moved, an idea that finally gained
acceptance in the 1960s. The theory offered new
explanations for how the diversity of life came to
colonize earth’s various land masses.
<p><b>EXTINCTION THEORY 1980</b>
<p>Luis Alvarez, a physicist, his son, Walter Alvarez, a
geologist, and other scientists discovered that an
asteroid hit the earth 65 million years ago, right at
the time of a mass extinction that included the
dinosaurs. Such mass extinctions cause evolutionary
upheavals.
<p><b>LESSONS OF THE EYE 1995</b>
<p>Walter Gehring and colleagues showed that the Pax-6
gene was acting as the master switch turning on the
development of eyes in animals as different as flies and
humans. It was one of the earliest and most striking
indications that evolution proceeded much more by
tinkering with ancient genes and much less by outright
invention than had ever been guessed.
