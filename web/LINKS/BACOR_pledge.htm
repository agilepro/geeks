 <tt>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</tt><br>
 <tt>June 27, 2002</tt><br>
 <tt>9TH CIRCUIT COURT UPHOLDS FIRST AMENDMENT SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE</tt><br>
 <tt>The Bay Area Communities of Reason fully support the 9th Circuit Court of
 Appeals well-reasoned decision regarding the</tt><br>
 <tt>unconstitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance. The Court has given all
 thinking people a long-overdue opportunity to consider what our</tt><br>
 <tt>Founding Fathers intended when, in spite of most of them being Christians
 of one denomination or another, they deliberately opted to leave God out of
 the Constitution.<o:p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Courier New'"><br>
 <tt>In the U.S. today, Catholics, Baptists, Methodists, Jews, Muslims, Hindis,
 people of all the other 2000 religions and millions of good folks without
 religion, live together in peace. We live in peace with one another because
 our forefathers fought the battle for real religious freedom during the War of
 Independence, during the Constitutional Conventions and during the
 ratification process. They succeeded. We benefited. 200 years without
 religious wars -- only in America.</tt><br>
 <br>
 Do<tt>n't be fooled by the Radical Right's rewriting of our history or by our
 desperate to be re-elected politicians sudden discovery of an election issue.
 Things won't get better by changing the constitution. We already have REAL
 freedom of religion in the USA.</tt><br>
 <br>
 “<tt>E pluribus unum”, Out of Many One, was the motto of a country that
 kept religious rage at bay for 200 years. Before the Constitution and the Bill
 of Rights were ratified, before the War of Independence, religious dissidents
 like Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson were banished from their communities.
 In other colonies Catholics and Baptists could not vote or hold office. That
 was the supposed foundation of our Christian Nation; that is what the Radical
 Right wants us to bring </tt>’<tt>back’ to America. Don't be suckered into
 destroying our constitution for them.</tt><br>
 <br>
 <tt>It wasn't until the 1950's during the McCarthy era and the 'Red Scare,'
 that the descendents of those sore losers who wanted to continue theocracy's
 hold over the country instead of creating a Constitutional Democracy finally
 found an opportunity to make a crack in the wall between church and state. The
 wall protects your religion from any particular denomination, or religion
 imposing its version of religion/God on you.</tt><br>
 <br>
 <tt>Don't be fooled by those who tell you that you need to pray in school to
 have religious freedom, or that you need to say a pledge that includes the
 words 'under God.' What you need is to protect the right of your pastor or
 rabbi or priest or imam to be able to preach what your group believes, in your
 church or synagogue or mosque or temple. That is religious freedom. What you
 need is for you and your neighbors to be free to believe what you believe, or
 even not to believe at all, as you choose. That is religious freedom.</tt><br>
 <br>
 <tt>Before you rush to support the Pledge of Allegiance or to defend prayer in
 school ...Remember the auto-da-fe. Remember the Inquisition. Our Founding
 Fathers remembered, and that's why they didn't make our motto, "In God We
 Trust." That's why they made the first 16 words of the First Amendment
 read... "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
 religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."</tt><br>
 <br>
 <tt>This is your opportunity to protect the wonder that is our constitutional
 democracy. This is your opportunity to protect REAL freedom of religion. This
 is your opportunity to stand up for freedom of religion for all. The Court's
 decision on the Pledge according to the Constitution that has so ably
 protected us from each other for 200 years, was a correct decision. In many
 Muslim countries, only one kind of Islam rules. In Northern Ireland, the
 country is divided between Protestants and Catholics. On the Protestant side,
 Catholics suffer; on the Catholic side Protestants suffer. Don't be part of
 bringing that horror back to our land. Write the 9th Circuit and remind them
 that they hold the Constitution of the country in their trust, encourage them
 to uphold their decision upon review. Write your Congresspersons and remind
 them that they took an oath to protect the Constitution, not to amend it.</tt><br>
