<h2 align=center>Fundamentalists: Notes on Personality Analysis and Religiosity as Neurosis</h2>
by Monroe Stein, Ph.D.
<p>Sigmund Freud, in his <i>Future of an Illusion</i>, regarded religion
as "the universal neurosis".&nbsp; He thereby implied that, if the neurotic
substrate of religious beliefs in supernaturalism and the ritual practice
accompanying them would ameliorated, the individual's need for religion
could be expected to reduce correspondingly, or even eliminated.&nbsp; An avowed
atheist, Freud devoted much attention through his writings, such as "Moses
and Monotheism" to the psychological and socio-historical sources of
religion.&nbsp; Although an atheist, he retained — as an integral part of his
ego-identity throughout his life — a tie with secular-cultural-humanistic
dimensions of Jewish ethnicity.
<p>The Viennese psychiatrist, Victor E. Frankl, unfortunately, but
to his ultimate personal enrichment due do to his self-transcending efforts
to rehabilitate himself, spent three years in the shadow of the gas chambers
of the Nazi death camps of Auschwitz and Dachau.&nbsp; Since then, he
seems — among his other contributions — to have uncovered, although
seemingly still unbeknown to himself, significant empirical support for
Freud's conception of religion as a "universal neurosis."
<p>That is to say, Frankl, as he noted in his "The Unheard Cry For
Meaning," when traveling through Mexico in 1975, came upon a Benedictine
monastery.&nbsp; He happened to discuss with the prior who ran the monastery the
issue of neurosis and freedom from it, evidently including the question of
the acquisition of religiosity.&nbsp; He learned that the prior had insisted that
the monks in his monastery undergo a strictly Freudian psychoanalysis, and
they did so.&nbsp; The outcome?&nbsp; Only 20 percent remained in the Monastery!&nbsp; This
finding is supportive of Freud's conception and mine too, that by reducing
the neurotic conflicts and other 'hang-ups' underlying religiosity, one
can be expected to evolve a more normal, rational life orientation.
<p>In the bio-social development, mostly beginning in late infancy,
as the individual inevitably encounters frustrations, disappointments, and
delayed and unmet satisfaction of needs, both basic and higher, a capacity
for frustration-tolerance, the ability to make assessments leading to
problem solving, and the devising and execution of coping strategies are
required for competence in living.&nbsp; When encountering vicissitudes in the
course of living, the individual — since actual merger with the nurturing,
all-giving mother is no longer possible — tends to be drawn to substitute,
as a vicarious parent figure, especially if he or she is subjected to
religious indoctrination, the fiction of a supreme being.&nbsp; In essence, the
individual projects onto the external world a fantasized modification of his
or her internalized parent figure image.
<p>If indoctrination takes hold, the individual projects his or her
infantile wishes onto the posited supreme being, who is typically replete with
the protagonist's prepackaged pap of arcane supernaturalism.&nbsp; The presence of
the pathopsychological sources and the dynamics of a belief in a deity can
be demonstrated more clearly, because the exaggerated nature of severe
abnormal conditions highlights them, in the religious delusions of many
schizophrenics.&nbsp; Intriguingly, these delusions show matriarchal features,
paralleling ancient and contemporary mother religions.
<p>In essence, the acquiring of religiosity is both prompted by and
enables the individual, otherwise seemingly mature in his or her
psychological functioning, to make experiencing the world a fantasized or
delusional reenactment, or both, of the dyadic infant and mother/father
relationship.&nbsp; In effect, Mickey Mouse-like "nursery" of comic proportions, a
vestige of the naïve, prescientific thinking, superstition, and ignorance of
humankind's primitive past appears.
<p>Religiosity may afford a noteworthy degree of surcease; it is
true, from anxieties, frustrations, and insecurity that dog one in the
course of independent living.&nbsp; It does so, however, at the cost of doing
violence to the crown of humankind's evolutionary achievement — the
phylogenic flowering of the supremacy of its intelligence, its unsurpassed
capacity for rationality, among the animal kingdom.
<p>I would like to attempt now a more detailed, sharply focused
delineation of the neurotic substrate of religiosity.&nbsp; In the very early
postnatal development of the child, i.e., in infancy, there is,
experientially, a sense of no boundary, a unity between himself or herself
and the outer world, consisting principally, of course, of the dyad of
infant and mother.&nbsp; In psychoanalytic terms, ego and non-ego are one, and if,
as usually occurs, the mother has a healthy, caring, nurturing merging with
the child, there exists for the child an experience of completeness, an
overall contentment imbuing the self and the surround.&nbsp; This experience of
unity between self and the world around the child affords the infant a
considerable sense of security — a narcissistic union mystica — a deep oral
union with the universe.
<p>Thus, the ecstatic experience of religious conversion, of being
"reborn again," that persons afflicted with religiosity so often stridently
claim, can be better understood as solely a pathopsychological phenomenon:
the transitory reestablishment, through regression, of the original "oceanic
feeling" — as Freud and Sandor Rado, an American psychoanalyst, labeled
it — that characterized the unity, the deep passive dependence, that the
infant experienced with the all giving mother.
<p>The infant's experience of unity, along with the contentment it
affords, gradually disappears as the child, through maturation and learning,
begins pari passu to meet with be intervals when the satisfaction of his or
her needs is delayed.&nbsp; The child then come to differentiate between self and
non-self, ego non ego.
<p>The child's earlier, contented phase of development leaves an
important residuum of memory content that — when difficulties in adaptive
functioning occur — tends to become revived, and to which the person longs,
although perhaps unbeknown to himself or herself, to regress, to
re-experience.&nbsp; This longing, actual and potential, provides a fertile
intrapsychic soil for the inculcation by organized religion of the wish
fantasies of "the good Lord watching over" oneself, of "taking care" of
oneself.
<p>To present this important insight, perhaps more sharply,
Margaret S. Mahler — a Viennese-bred psychoanalyst — noted in the Journal
of the American Psychoanalytic association in 1971:
<p>The entire life cycle constitutes a more or less successful
process of distancing from the introjections of the lost symbiotic mother,
an eternal longing for the actual or fantasized "ideal state of self," with
the later standing for a symbiotic fusion with the "all good symbiotic
mother," who was at one time part of the self in a blissful state of well being.
<p><b>TOWARD A PERSONALITY ANALYSIS</b>
<p>In my analysis, based on observation, two of the more
outstanding features of the mental and personality functioning — or, more
apropos, malfunctioning — of fundamentalists are (a) the certitude with
which they appear to hold and present their beliefs in the supernatural, and
(b) their inability to think in a critical, a analytic way about their
religious beliefs, most notably those concerning the supernatural realm.
Indeed, these two areas of pathopsychological functioning appear to afflict,
to a greater or lesser extent, all persons saddled with religiosity, but
they are particularly striking in fundamentalists.
<p>The fundamentalist's certitude, by its strongly exaggerated
nature, can be better understood as a psychoneurotic symptom complex, a part
of a neurotic defensive formation, erected against unconscious doubt of
comparable, exaggerated degree with the certitude.&nbsp; Further, the substitution
of certitude for as Bertrand Russell noted in a philosophical sense,
ignorance is not permissible in science nor, for that matter, in any
rational thinking.&nbsp; It is a form of intellectual travesty of human
intelligence.
<p>The panoply of neurotic defensive formation of fundamentalism
accounts in great measure for their limiting of their social contacts, as
Vlaardingerbroek points out, to their own circumscribed in-groups.&nbsp; They
thereby avoid the arousal in themselves of feelings of insecurity which
would otherwise be produced by encountering persons who hold, and would do
in do course express, contrary beliefs of a religious nature, thereby
endangering the fundamentalists' defenses against the powerful, underlying
doubt deep within themselves.
<p>In the same vein, the gullibility of the fundamentalist in
relation for his or her religious dogma, which Vlaardingerbroek so aptly
points out too, is also part of the neurotic defensive formation against the
presence of unconscious doubt, a mode of bolstering the self erected "wall"
within their minds against strong, deep-lying uncertainty.&nbsp; By the same
token, the fundamentalist's self-righteous attitude reveals, by its marked,
exaggerate nature also, that it is part of the bulwark of the neurotic
defense formation, in this instance against underlying hostile, self
serving, greedy, and even anti-social tendencies, a literal maelstrom of
"sinfulness" beneath the surface of their personalities.&nbsp; The sensitive,
trained eye can often discern the presence of the "sinful" propensities
through the surface of their personalities; these propensities are so close
to overt expression.
<p>In psychoanalytic terms, the most salient mechanism of defense
in the fundamentalist's array of neurotic defenses can be considered to be
reaction formation.&nbsp; This defense consists of the conversion into its
opposite of unconscious and partially preconscious thought, attitudes, and
wishes, such as hostile, asocial, and antisocial trends that are — as
fundamentalists would on a conscious level, regard them — repugnant,
ie., "sinful"
<p>Characteristically, reaction formation is much less strong —
even somewhat brittle, because it is not as basic, mostly due to its
acquisition at a later stage of personality development — than many of the
other mechanisms of defense, such as a repression.&nbsp; Thus, the
fundamentalist's neurotic defensive formation is subject to break down
intermittently, such as may be manifested in a extramarital sexual venture.&nbsp;
In a similar vein reaction formation may permit the partial expression, in
sustained but attenuated form as if through a screen, in manifest behavior
of underlying, morally unacceptable trends against which it is supposedly
arrayed, such as clandestine indulgence in pornography or the surreptitious
diverting of monies, contributed by the public for religious purposes, for
ones greedy use.
<p>Thus, the fundamentalist in his or her own façade of
self-righteousness may, and commonly does, manifest only a thin, even
translucent disguise of his or her underlying "sinfulness," which the
neurotic defensive formation aims to hold in abeyance.&nbsp; In brief, then, the
fundamentalist not only possess s greater than average, troublesome degree
of underlying socially and morally unacceptable trends, but he or she holds
these "sinful" propensities in check only precariously.
<p>When in argumentation centered on his religious belief system
the fundamentalist sees himself in danger of as Vlaardingerbroek phrases it
"being shown up;" he can be better understood as feeling threatened by the
weakening — in the psychoanalytic sense — of one of the bulwarks in his
neurotic personality structure.&nbsp; This religious belief system, pivotal in his
neurotic defenses, is prone — under the pressure of likely imminent
weakening — to give rise to a charge of anxiety, sparked by the feared
consequences of the possible surfacing into conscious awareness of his
unconscious doubt.
<p>In the same vein, when engaging fundamentalists in serious
discussion challenging the validity of their religious beliefs, particularly
concerning supernatural phenomena and the literal interpretation of biblical
myths, they are virtually limited to countering the challenge, with
emotionalism and over-righteousness, by reaffirming, in hackneyed phrases,
their stock beliefs.&nbsp; The fundamentalist appears unable, evidently, to rise
above the level of reaffirmation, even if one points out to him his dogged
failure to rise above this level.
<p>The conclusion forces itself upon one that the religious
indoctrination to which fundamentalists, including religious zealots, both
expose themselves repeatedly and to which they are regularly subjected has
the insidious effect of preventing the development of the ability to think
critically about dogma they embrace or, if such ability has ever been
acquired, to be paralyzed in exercising it.
<p>It is safe to infer then, as perhaps an original discovery in
religious psychotherapy, that the inculcation of "faith" by systematic
indoctrination involves pari passu the prevention of the development of the
capacity to adopt a critical attitude, to think analytically about the
"faith or, if such capacity has ever been acquired, to stifle it.&nbsp;
Unquestionably, the perpetration of such a defect on the human mind is
unconscionable and a tragic assault on the hard-won liberal tradition of our
Western civilization.&nbsp; Ironically, fundamentalists regard this abortion or
paralysis of such ratiocinative powers as virtuous, and praiseworthy!
<p>Still further, the fundamentalist also appears disposed, as an
expression of his neurotic personality structure, to use the mini-guerrilla
tactic of "cutting off," again and again, his opponent's efforts to voice
his thoughts.&nbsp; At the same time, the fundamentalist seems apt to augment such
frustrating harassment by loud talking and, even more maddening, snickering
at the points his opponent makes instead of replying thoughtfully to them (gallows
humor).&nbsp; That is to say, the fundamentalist repeatedly starts to talk in
the midst of his opponent's attempts to express his thoughts, thereby
"jamming" them.&nbsp; The fundamentalist can be expected to persist in doing so
even though his opponent confronts him, again and again, with the
obstructionist nature of the tactic, the feeling of insecurity that prompts
it, and its offending un-sportsman like, and harassing nature.&nbsp; One gains the
impression that the fundamentalist, by hostilely persisting with stone faced
indifference, thereby reenacts in microcosm organized religion's long
history of adamant suppression of dissent as "heresy."<p>
