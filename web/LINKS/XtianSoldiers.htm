our nation to be at war against Iraq, we shall gloriously comply.<p>

<p>By CHARLES MARSH<br>January 20, 2006<p>
IN the past several years, American evangelicals, and I
am one of them, have amassed greater political power than at any time in our
history. But at what cost to our witness and the integrity of our message?
<p>Recently, I took a few days to reread the war sermons
delivered by influential evangelical ministers during the lead up to the
Iraq war. That period, from the fall of 2002 through the spring of 2003, is
not one I will remember fondly. Many of the most respected voices in
American evangelical circles blessed the president's war plans, even when
doing so required them to recast Christian doctrine.
<p>Charles Stanley, pastor of the First Baptist Church of
Atlanta, whose weekly sermons are seen by millions of television viewers,
led the charge with particular fervor. "We should offer to serve the war
effort in any way possible," said Mr. Stanley, a former president of the
Southern Baptist Convention. "God battles with people who oppose him, who
fight against him and his followers." In an article carried by the
convention's Baptist Press news service, a missionary wrote that "American
foreign policy and military might have opened an opportunity for the Gospel
in the land of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob."
<p>As if working from a slate of evangelical talking
points, both Franklin Graham, the evangelist and son of Billy Graham, and
Marvin Olasky, the editor of the conservative World magazine and a former
advisor to President Bush on faith-based policy, echoed these sentiments,
claiming that the American invasion of Iraq would create exciting new
prospects for proselytizing Muslims. Tim LaHaye, the co-author of the hugely
popular "Left Behind" series, spoke of Iraq as "a focal point of end-time
events," whose special role in the earth's final days will become clear
after invasion, conquest and reconstruction. For his part, Jerry Falwell
boasted that "God is pro-war" in the title of an essay he wrote in 2004.
<p>The war sermons rallied the evangelical congregations
behind the invasion of Iraq. An astonishing 87 percent of all white
evangelical Christians in the United States supported the president's
decision in April 2003. Recent polls indicate that 68 percent of white
evangelicals continue to support the war. But what surprised me, looking at
these sermons nearly three years later, was how little attention they paid
to actual Christian moral doctrine. Some tried to square the American
invasion with Christian "just war" theory, but such efforts could never
quite reckon with the criterion that force must only be used as a last
resort. As a result, many ministers dismissed the theory as no longer
relevant.
<p>Some preachers tried to link Saddam Hussein with
wicked King Nebuchadnezzar of Biblical fame, but these arguments depended on
esoteric interpretations of the Old Testament book of II Kings and could not
easily be reduced to the kinds of catchy phrases that are projected onto
video screens in vast evangelical churches. The single common theme among
the war sermons appeared to be this: our president is a real brother in
Christ, and because he has discerned that God's will is for our nation to be
at war against Iraq, we shall gloriously comply.
<p>Such sentiments are a far cry from those expressed in
the Lausanne Covenant of 1974. More than 2,300 evangelical leaders from 150
countries signed that statement, the most significant milestone in the
movement's history. Convened by Billy Graham and led by John Stott, the
revered Anglican evangelical priest and writer, the signatories affirmed the
global character of the church of Jesus Christ and the belief that "the
church is the community of God's people rather than an institution, and must
not be identified with any particular culture, social or political system,
or human ideology."
<p>On this page, David Brooks correctly noted that if
evangelicals elected a pope, it would most likely be Mr. Stott, who is the
author of more than 40 books on evangelical theology and Christian devotion.
Unlike the Pope John Paul II, who said that invading Iraq would violate
Catholic moral teaching and threaten "the fate of humanity," or even Pope
Benedict XVI, who has said there were "not sufficient reasons to unleash a
war against Iraq," Mr. Stott did not speak publicly on the war. But in a
recent interview, he shared with me his abiding concerns.
<p>"Privately, in the days preceding the invasion, I had
hoped that no action would be taken without United Nations authorization,"
he told me. "I believed then and now that the American and British
governments erred in proceeding without United Nations approval." Reverend
Stott referred me to "War and Rumors of War, " a chapter from his 1999 book,
"New Issues Facing Christians Today," as the best account of his position.
In that essay he wrote that the Christian community's primary mission must
be "to hunger for righteousness, to pursue peace, to forbear revenge, to
love enemies, in other words, to be marked by the cross."
<p>What will it take for evangelicals in the United
States to recognize our mistaken loyalty? We have increasingly isolated
ourselves from the shared faith of the global Church, and there is no
denying that our Faustian bargain for access and power has undermined the
credibility of our moral and evangelistic witness in the world. The Hebrew
prophets might call us to repentance, but repentance is a tough demand for a
people utterly convinced of their righteousness.</font>
