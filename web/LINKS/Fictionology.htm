<h1>Scientology Losing Ground To New Fictionology</h1>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 15px">LOS ANGELES—According to a report released Monday
by the American Institute of Religions, the Church of Scientology, once one of
the fastest-growing religious organizations in the U.S., is steadily losing
members to the much newer religion Fictionology.</p>

<p>"Unlike Scientology, which is based on empirically verifiable scientific
tenets, Fictionology's central principles are essentially fairy tales with no
connection to reality," the AIR report read. "In short, Fictionology
offers its followers a mythical belief system free from the cumbersome
scientific method to which Scientology is hidebound."
<p>Created in 2003 by self-proclaimed messiah Bud Don Ellroy, Fictionology's
principles were first outlined in the self-help paperback <i>Imaginetics: The
New Pipe-Dream Of Modern Mental Make-Believe.</i>
<p>Fictionology's central belief, that any imaginary construct can be
incorporated into the church's ever-growing set of official doctrines, continues
to gain popularity. Believers in Santa Claus, his elves, or the Tooth Fairy are
permitted—even encouraged—to view them as deities. Even corporate mascots
like the Kool-Aid Man are valid objects of Fictionological worship.
<p>"My personal savior is Batman," said Beverly Hills plastic surgeon
Greg Jurgenson. "My wife chooses to follow the teachings of the Gilmore
Girls. Of course, we are still beginners. Some advanced-level Fictionologists
have total knowledge of every lifetime they have ever lived for the last 80
trillion years."
<p>"Sure, it's total bullshit," Jurgenson added. "But that's
Fictionology. Praise Batman!"
<p>While the Church of Fictionology acknowledges that its purported worldwide
membership of 450 billion is an invented number, the AIR report estimates that
as many as 70 percent of the church's followers are former Scientologists.
<p>Church of Scientology public-relations spokesman Al Kurz said he was
"shocked" when he learned that Fictionology is approaching the
popularity of his religion.</p>

<p>"Scientology is rooted in strict scientific principles, such as the
measurement of engrams in the brain by the E-Meter," Kurz said.
"Scientology uses strictly scientific methodologies to undo the damage done
75 million years ago by the Galactic Confederation's evil warlord Xenu—we
offer our preclear followers procedures to erase overts in the reactive mind.
Conversely, Fictionology is essentially just a bunch of make-believe
nonsense."
<p>Hollywood actor David McSavage, who converted to Fictionology last year,
attempted to explain.
<p>"Scientology can only offer data, such as how an Operating Thetan can
control matter, energy, space, and time with pure thought alone," McSavage
said. "But truly spiritual people don't care about data, especially those
seeking an escape from very real physical, mental, or emotional problems."
<p>McSavage added, "As a Fictionologist, I live in a world of pretend. It's
liberating."
<p>A tax-exempt organization, the Church of Fictionology stands poised to become
a great moneymaking power if it continues to grow at its current rate—a
situation Kurz called "outrageous."
<p>"In recruiting new members, Fictionology preys on the gullible with
fanciful stories and simple-minded solutions," Kurz said.
"Fictionology is depriving legitimate churches of the revenue they need to
carry out charitable works worldwide—important charitable works like clearing
the planet of body-thetan implants."
