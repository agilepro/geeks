<h2>Conservative Satanic Agenda for Bush</h2>
Salutations and warm regards!<p>
We at the Conservative Satanic Agenda (CSA) believe
that in these frightening and confusing times, it is
vitally important to put aside our individual
differences and SUPPORT OUR LEADERS. Now more than
ever, we need leaders in Washington who will stand
firm in defense of our national interests, both here
and abroad.<p>
The Bush Administration has stood for America through
a horrifying crisis and potentially endless war, and
we as a nation must continue to support the strength
that our leaders have come to represent, so that we
may remain the most powerful nation on earth. We at
CSA are of the highest hope that you will consider the
timely importance of standing behind strong leadership
when going to the polls this fall.<p>
Thank you for your consideration.<p>

The Nine Satanic Statements<p>
By Anton Szandor LaVey [i]<p>
1. Satan represents indulgence, instead of abstinence!<p>
By bowing out of the Kyoto treaty and refusing to
discuss global climate change, President Bush has
insured that American industries will continue to
prosper.<p>
2. Satan represents vital existence, instead of
spiritual pipe dreams!<p>
. Now more than ever, citizens of the modern world
require prosperity and growth to meet the challenges
of the coming era, and we believe that among
politicians, the Bush Administration is uniquely in
touch with this reality.<p>
3. Satan represents undefiled wisdom, instead of
hypocritical self-deceit!<p>
We at CSA wholeheartedly endorse Defense Secretary
Donald Rumsfeld’s recent statements to the effect that
it’s not important whether the world approves of our
impending strikes against Iraq; it is only important
that we do what we know to be right.<p>
4. Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it,
instead of love wasted on ingrates!<p>
The Bush Administration has consistently and
intelligently linked aid to third world countries to
development, and backed away from wasting resources on
dead-end welfare programs. <p>
5. Satan represents vengeance, instead of turning the
other cheek!<p>
We call your attention to The Administration’s
masterful retaliation against Al-Queda and their
sympathizers after 9/11. <p>
6. Satan represents responsibility to the responsible,
instead of concern for vampires!<p>
Civilization as we know it runs on energy. It is very
important that our energy sources remain secure and
intact. President Bush lives with the burden of this
awesome responsibility every day. <p>
7. Satan represents man as just another animal,
sometimes better, more often worse than those who walk
on all fours, who, because of his “divine spiritual
and intellectual development”, has become the most
vicious animal of all!
---- "These are the kind that go to a cave and send
youngsters to their suicidal death. That's the kind of
people we're fighting. But there's no cave deep enough
for America, or dark enough to hide." George W. Bush,
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Aug. 29, 2002<p>
8. Satan represents all of the so-called sins, as they
all lead to physical, mental, or emotional
gratification!<p>
While it may not be politically expedient to discuss
what George W. did prior to becoming Governer of
Texas, we would like to simply say that this man most
certainly has our confidence.<p>
9. Satan has been the best friend the church has ever
had, as He has kept it in business all these years!<p>
CSA strongly supports President Bush’s faith-based
social programs.<p><hr><p><h3 align=center>
