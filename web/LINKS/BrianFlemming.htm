<p>In his film "The God Who Wasn't There," Brian Flemming questions the very
existence of Jesus Christ, a premise that might leave some hard-core
Christians convinced this former Christian is going to hell.
<p>In the film, Flemming argues that the biblical Jesus is a myth, a legend
based on allegorical stories that were never supposed to be seen as
historical accounts.
<p>It's a provocative claim but not without precedent. Many scholars have
questioned the
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus">
historicity</a> of the Jesus story, although it remains central to Christian
beliefs.
<p>Flemming, who now considers himself an atheist, lays out his case in
interviews with academics and in conversations with believers outside a
Billy Graham rally. He also returns to the evangelical school he attended in
Southern California for a confrontational interview with the headmaster.
<p>The film has been criticized by conservative Christian groups like Focus
on the Family, which has taken issue with its scholarship, and praised by
religious skeptics as an antidote to blind faith. Following a limited
theatrical run, "The God Who Wasn't There" has been screening at venues
around the country, including many showings sponsored by atheist groups. The
DVD went on sale in stores Jan. 31.
<p>I spoke with Flemming by phone from his office in Los Angeles.<br>
<hr><b>Why did you make this movie?</b>
<p>I was looking into the theory that Jesus Christ never existed -- actually
from the perspective that it probably was not true -- that Jesus probably
did exist. I was interested in understanding why people would believe that
he didn't -- because I've always had sort of a fascination with crackpot
theories. And the more I looked into it, the more I realized that the true
crackpot theory was the idea that the history of Jesus has somehow been
passed accurately down to us 2,000 years later.
<p><b>What's the main evidence, as you see it, that the biblical Jesus did
not exist?</b>
<p>It's more a matter of demonstrating a positive than a negative, and the
positive is that early Christians appeared not to have believed in a
historical Jesus. If the very first Christians appear to believe in a
mythical Christ, and only later did "historical" details get added bit by
bit, that is not consistent with the real man actually existing.
<p><b>So you're saying that the story of Jesus is a myth, a figment of our
imagination?</b>
<p>I would say that he is a myth in the same way that many other characters
people believed actually existed. Like
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Tell">William
Tell</a> is most likely a myth, according to many folklorists and many
historians. Of course, [Jesus] is a very important myth. I think that he was
invented a long time ago, and those stories have been passed on as if they
are true.
<p><b>Where do you believe the story of Jesus actually comes from?</b>
<p>Specific elements of the Jesus story are derived from a variety of
sources. Most of them are from the Old Testament, and most of them are
probably invented by people who never thought that people would take what
they were writing as serious history.
<p>They were doing what's called
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midrash">midrash</a>
(biblical interpretation) -- they would meditate upon these Old Testament
Scriptures and out of the details created this mythical Messiah. This, of
course, is the reason that so many Christians say, "Well, Jesus fulfilled
prophecy in the Old Testament." Of course he did. He was invented
consciously out of the Scriptures in the Old Testament.
<p><b>To many Christians, what you're claiming is pure blasphemy. Some of
them are probably wondering, "Where do you get off?"</b>
<p>There are all sort of things that religious people believe and consider
to be sacred, claims that have no relationship whatsoever to the truth. In
fact, it's rather obvious that religions have competing claims to the truth.
And what one religion considers sacred is contradictory to what another
religion considers sacred. Obviously, one of them has to be wrong.
<p><b>What kind of reactions are you getting from Christians?</b>
<p>A lot of them are angry that the film was made. The subtext of a lot of
their criticism, which I find telling, is that even if it's true you
shouldn't make this film. Of course, I'm a former Christian and I think for
some people viewing the film there's a sense of betrayal about my having
made it.
<p><b>Tell me about your upbringing as a Christian. Were your parents strict
with you about religion?</b>
<p>My parents were Methodists, and they were believing Christians, but I
didn't have the sort of apocalyptic doctrine pounded into me at home. It was
really this school that I went to that was the source of the fundamentalist
Christian doctrine that infected my head.
<p><b>There's a scene in the film where you return to that school and
confront the headmaster. Was that a cathartic moment for you?</b>
<p>Sure, but it's not like I hated the school while I was going there. The
thing about Christianity is that when you are in the grip of it, you think
it's true. You think you really are a horrible person because you have ideas
about sex. You think that everything about yourself is confirming that you
are this horrible sinner who needs redemption all the time. But you don't
really blame the institution. You think they are just telling you the truth.
<p><b>At what point did you realize you were an atheist?</b>
<p>I kind of realized it gradually. At first it was like, OK, clearly
fundamentalist Christianity is wrong, but Christianity is probably right.
Then the more I actually thought about it, the more I deduced my way to
atheism.
<p><b>What does being an atheist mean to you?</b>
<p>To me, an atheist is someone who has looked at the argument for God and
found it extremely wanting. I consider the chance that God exists to be
vanishingly small, to the point where it's not worth thinking about.
<p><b>Have you ever had any spiritual feelings?</b>
<p>I think "spiritual" is a word with so many definitions that it's almost
useless. I don't really know what people mean by it. If they mean, "Do I
believe in supernatural forces that are affecting our world?" -- then the
answer is that I haven't seen any evidence for it yet.
<p>But if they mean, "Do you believe that humanity can create its own set of
morals and can lift itself up to a better state than it's in right now?" --
the answer is yes! I do believe in that. I believe in humanity, not in some
sort of magical book that's going to tell us how to do that.
<p><b>Where does your sense of morality come from, now that you're no longer
religious?</b>
<p>My sense of morality comes from the place it always has -- it comes from
me. I think that humans have always been the best source of morality. I
mean, even laws that we consider biblical didn't come from any God. They
came from humans inventing those laws, and over time, we humans have just
tried to decide which of those laws are moral and which aren't.
<p><b>Even if what you are saying is true about the Bible not being the
literal truth, it's still a powerful story. On what basis do you reject the
ideas and values of Christianity? Or do they still make sense to you?</b>
<p>I'm not saying that everything Jesus said about how to live one's life is
suddenly a bad thing. All I'm saying is that he doesn't exist, and it would
be a healthy thing for Christians to look at the Bible as a work of fiction
from which they can take inspiration rather than, you know, the
authoritative word of God.
<p>That's an extremely critical difference. It can mean the difference
between nations going to war and nations not going to war. If you can see
your literature as fictional, written by men who had some good ideas and
some bad ones too, then I think we'll start getting along much better with
the rest of the world.
<p><b>How does your family feel about your coming out as an atheist and your
decision to make this film?</b>
<p>My parents are OK with the fact that I'm an atheist. They kind of wish I
hadn't made the film, though. I have a great relationship with my parents,
and this film hasn't changed that in any way. But we pretty much avoid
talking about the ideas contained in the film when we are together.
<p><b>Do you really think this film will change anyone's minds?</b>
<p>I know for a fact that the ideas in the film shake the confidence of
believing Christians who haven't researched their own religion, and that's a
big group of people. Many of them of have written to me and said so. Now,
whether they will go back to believing what they believed, I don't know. But
I do know it's done some damage to their faith, which is see as a positive
thing.
