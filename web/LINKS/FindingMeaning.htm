style='color:black'>Finding Meaning in a Contingent Universe,</span></u></b><span
style='color:black'> by Michael Shermer<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>I am often asked by believers why
I abandoned Christianity and how I found meaning in the apparently meaningless
universe presented by science.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
implication is that the scientific world-view is an existentially depressing
one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Without God, I am bluntly told,
what's the point? If this is all there is, there is no use.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To the contrary.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>For me quite the opposite is true.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The conjuncture of losing my religion, finding science, and
discovering glorious contingency was remarkably empowering and liberating.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It gave me a sense of joy and freedom.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Freedom to think for myself.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Freedom to take responsibility for my own
actions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Freedom to construct my own
meanings and my own destinies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>With the
knowledge that this may be all there is, and that I can trigger my own
cascading changes, I was free to live life to its fullest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>This is not to say that those who
are religious cannot share in these freedoms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>But for me, and not just for me, a world absent monsters, ghosts,
demons, and gods unfetters the mind to soar to new heights, to think
unthinkable thoughts, to imagine the unimaginable, to contemplate infinity and
eternity knowing that no one is looking back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The universe takes on a whole new meaning when you know that your place
in it was not foreordained, that it was not designed for us, indeed, that it
was not designed at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If we are
nothing more than star stuff and bio mass, how special life becomes.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If the tape were played again and again
without the appearance of our species, how extraordinary becomes our existence,
and, correspondingly, how cherished.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To
share in the sublimity of knowledge generated by other human minds, and perhaps
even to make a tiny contribution toward that body of knowledge that will be
passed down through the ages, part of the cumulative wisdom of a single species
on a tiny planet orbiting an ordinary star on the remote edge of a
not-so-unusual galaxy, itself a member of a cluster of galaxies millions of
light years from nowhere, is sublime beyond words.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Since we are such a visual
primate, perhaps images can help capture the feeling.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The Hubble Telescope Deep Field photograph, revealing as never
before the rich density of galaxies in our neck of the universe, is as grand a statement
about the sacred as any medieval cathedral.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>How vast is the cosmos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>How
contingent is our place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Yet out of
this apparent insignificance emerges a glorious contingency--the recognition
that we did not have to be, but here we are.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>In fact, compare this slice of the cosmos to two of the most hallowed
and sacrosanct structures on Earth--both medieval in age but on opposite sides
of the planet, literally and figuratively: Machu Picchu and Chartres
Cathedral.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Machu Picchu captures the
numina through an interlocking relationship between nature and humanity that
generated in me an almost mystical connection across space and time with the
ancients that had once lived and loved atop this 8,000-foot precipice.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is the "lost city" in so many
ways.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When I stood inside Chartres
Cathedral with my soul mate, lit candles, and promised each other our eternal
love, it was a more sacred moment than any I have experienced.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Skeptics and scientists cannot experience
the numinous? Nonsense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You do not need
a spiritual power to experience the spiritual.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>You do not need to be mystical to appreciate the mystery.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Standing beneath a canopy of galaxies, atop
a pillar of reworked stone, or inside a transcept of holy light, my unencumbered
soul was free to love without constraint, free to use my senses to enjoy all
the pleasures and endure all the pains that come with such love.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I was enfranchised for life, emancipated
from the bonds of restricting tradition, and unyoked from the rules written for
another time in another place for another people.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>I was now free to try to live up to that exalted moniker--Homo
sapiens--wise man.<b><o:p></o:p></b></span></p>
