<h1 align=center>Schizophrenia and Christian Fundamentalism</h1>
<hr><p>

This is a definition of schizophrenia and some of its symptoms.&nbsp; Schizophrenia
bears an uncanny resemblance to 'Christian
fundamentalism'.&nbsp; These are not my own definitions; they are snipped
from recognized medical sites and medical encyclopedia.<p><br>

<h2>Definition</h2>
Any of a group of psychotic disorders usually characterized by
withdrawal from reality, illogical patterns of thinking, delusions,
and hallucinations, and accompanied in varying degrees by other
emotional, behavioral, or intellectual disturbances.&nbsp; Schizophrenia
is associated with dopamine imbalances in the brain and defects of
the frontal lobe and is caused by genetic, other biological, and
psychosocial factors.<p><br>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<h3>Delusions</h3>
Delusions are false beliefs that are deeply entrenched and clearly
not based in reality and are not consistent with cultural beliefs or
the persons' level of intelligence and life experiences.&nbsp; Persons
cling to these believes even after the believes are shown to be false.<p>

These false beliefs may be very difficult for family or friends to
understand, since they do not make sense.&nbsp; Again, a delusion seems as
real to the person as a belief grounded in reality.<p>

<h3>Specific Delusions</h3>
Bizarre delusions are hallucinations consisting of two or more
voices conversing with each other or of a single voice affecting a
person's behaviors or thoughts.<p>
• Unworthy Said: - "How do I know God has said anything? I have
heard him speak in an audible voice".<br>
• Phoenix said: - "As I was going about my daily task, the Lord spoke to me...."<p>

<h3>Hallucinations</h3>
People with schizophrenia may experience hallucinations.&nbsp; That is,
they may hear, see, feel or smell things that are not there.&nbsp; Just as
in a dream, where fantastic events can not be distinguished from
real events, hallucinations can not be distinguished from real
events.&nbsp; Thus, the hallucination of a voice talking is perceived in
the brain just like a real person talking.<p>

Discussions about their objective truth or plausibility of the
hallucinations are not valuable.&nbsp; The experience is true and very
vivid to the patient and has to be accepted as such.&nbsp; Attempts
to "set the person straight" result in resistance, tension, and bad feelings.<p>

Hallucinations are false perceptions or unreal apparitions.&nbsp; They do
not correspond to the stimuli that is present and have no basis in
reality.&nbsp; You have to remember that what is an hallucination in one
culture, is not in another.<p>

'Ray of light' believes he can fly around outside of his physical
body.<p>

<h3>Disorganized Speech Or Behavior</h3>
A person with schizophrenia may have disorganized speech or
behavior; so that what they do or say does not make much sense.<p>

<h3>Preoccupations</h3>
These are fixed ideas, not necessarily false (like delusions) but
overvalued.&nbsp; That means they take on extraordinary importance and
take up an inordinate amount of thought time.<p>

One idea often returns and returns.&nbsp; Frequently it is a worry about
doing the right thing or doing it well or doing it in time.&nbsp;
Characteristically, the worry grows and becomes unrealistic.&nbsp; A
common sequence of events is for the worry to take up so much of a
person's time that the "right thing" does not get done and its not
being done is then attributed to the bad motives of others.&nbsp; Or it
may be rationalized as God's wish.<p>

These kinds of explanations sound odd to others but to the patient
they seem warranted.&nbsp; He does not understand why others see them
merely as "excuses."&nbsp; To him they explain the facts better than any
other explanation he can think of.<p>

Sometimes these preoccupations have a mystifying character to them.&nbsp;
They seem to require puzzling over and decoding.&nbsp; The schizophrenic
patient spends much time in this kind of activity and that is why he
thinks he has solved mysteries that others haven't, since they have
spent no time at it.<p>

<h3>Denial of illness</h3>
Some individuals are able to admit to themselves that they could
ever be deficient or vulnerable in any way.&nbsp; Most illnesses that
start in late adolescence tend to be denied because adolescence is a
time when deficiencies are hard to accept.&nbsp; The problem of illness
denial is that it makes treatment impossible.&nbsp; This is true of all
illnesses that require treatment and is not specific for
schizophrenia.&nbsp; Since lack of treatment in schizophrenia can have
serious consequences, families need to be especially firm about this.<p>

Schizophrenic Symptoms are continuous and persistent.

<h3>Secondary symptoms (Mechanisms patients may develop to cope with fundamental symptoms.)</h3>

Hallucinations, paranoid ideation, grandiosity, argumentative,
Superiority complex, inappropriate laughter.<p>
