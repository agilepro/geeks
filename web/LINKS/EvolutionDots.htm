<h1>Fossil connects human evolution dots</h1>
April 12, 2006<p>
<b style="font-size: 14px">WASHINGTON
(AP) -- The latest fossil unearthed from a human ancestral hot spot
in Africa allows scientists to link together the most complete chain
of human evolution so far.</b>
<p>The 4.2 million-year-old fossil
discovered in northeastern Ethiopia helps scientists fill in the
gaps of how human ancestors made the giant leap from one species to
another.
<p>That's because the newest fossil, the species Australopithecus
anamensis, was found in the region of the Middle Awash -- where
seven other human-like species spanning nearly 6 million years and
three major phases of human development were previously discovered.
<p>"We just found the chain of evolution, the continuity through
time," study co-author and Ethiopian anthropologist Berhane Asfaw
said in a phone interview from Addis Ababa. "One form evolved to
another. This is evidence of evolution in one place through time."
<p>The findings were reported Thursday in the scientific journal
Nature.
<p>The species anamensis is not new, but its location is what helps
explain the shift from one early phase of human-like development to
the next, scientists say. All eight species were within an easy
day's walk of each other.
<p>Until now, what scientists had were snapshots of human evolution
scattered around the world. Finding everything all in one general
area makes those snapshots more of a mini home movie of evolution.
<p>"It's like 12 frames of a home movie, but a home movie covering 6
million years," said study lead author Tim White, co-director of
Human Evolution Research Center at University of California at
Berkeley.
<p>"The key here is the sequences," White said. "It's about a mile
thickness of rocks in the Middle Awash and in it we can see all
three phases of human evolution."
<p>Modern man belongs to the genus Homo, which is a subgroup in the
family of hominids. What evolved into Homo was likely the genus
Australopithecus (once called "man-ape"), which includes the famed
3.2 million-year-old "Lucy" fossil found three decades ago.
<p>A key candidate for the genus that evolved into Australopithecus
is called Ardipithecus. And Thursday's finding is important in
bridging -- but not completely -- the gap between Australopithecus
and Ardipithecus.
<p>In 1994, a 4.4 million-year-old partial skeleton of the species
Ardipithecus ramidus -- the most recent Ardipithecus species -- was
found about six miles from the latest discovery.
<p>"This appears to be the link between Australopithecus and
Ardipithecus as two different species," White said. The major
noticeable difference between the phases of man can be seen in
Australopithecus' bigger chewing teeth to eat harder food, he said.
<p>While it's looking more likely, it is not a sure thing that
Ardipithecus evolved into Australopithecus, he said. The finding
does not completely rule out Ardipithecus dying off as a genus and
Australopithecus developing independently.
<p>The connections between Ardipithecus and Australopithecus have
been theorized since an anamensis fossil was first found in Kenya 11
years ago. This draws the lines better, said Alan Walker of Penn
State University, who found the first anamensis and is not part of
White's team.
<p>Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian's Human Origins Program,
agreed: "For those people who are tied up in doing the whole human
family tree, being able to connect the branches is a very important
thing to do."<p><hr><h3 align=center>
