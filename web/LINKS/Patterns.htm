<p>ScienceDaily (June 20, 2008) — A zebra’s stripes, a seashell’s spirals, a butterfly’s wings:
these are all examples of patterns in nature. The formation of
patterns is a puzzle for mathematicians and biologists alike.
How does the delicate design of a butterfly’s wings come from a
single fertilized egg? How does pattern emerge out of no pattern?
<p>Using computer models and live cells, researchers at Johns
Hopkins have discovered a specific pattern that can direct cell
movement and may help us understand how metastatic cancer cells
move.<p>“Pattern formation is a classic problem in embryology,”
says Denise Montell, Ph.D., a professor of biological chemistry
at Hopkins. “At some point, cells in an embryo must separate
into those that will become heart cells, liver cells, blood
cells and so on. Although this has been studied for years, there
is still a lot we don’t understand.”
<p>As an example of pattern formation, the researchers studied
the process of how about six cells in the fruit fly distinguish
themselves from neighboring cells and move from one location in
the ovary to another during egg development. “In order for this
cell migration to happen, you have to have cells that go and
cells that stay,” says Montell. “There must be a clear
distinction — a separation between different types of cells,
which on the surface look the same.”
<p>Previous work identified a specific signal necessary for
getting these fly egg cells to move; the problem is that this
signal is “graded.” Like drops of ink spreading out on wet
paper, this signal travels in between surrounding cells,
gradually fading away as it moves outwards. But clear lines are
required for pattern formation — there is no grey area between a
zebra’s black and white stripes, between heart and liver cells
and, in this case, between migrating cells and those that stay put.
<p>How are graded signals converted to a clear move or stay
signal? By examining flies containing mutations in different
genes, the researchers discovered that one gene in particular,
called apontic, is important for converting a graded signal.
“When apontic is mutated, the distinction between migrating and
nonmigrating cells is fuzzy,” says Michelle Starz-Gaiano, Ph.D.,
a postdoctoral fellow in biological chemistry. “In these
mutants, we see a lot of cases where migrating cells do not
properly detach from their neighbors but instead drag them along
as they move away.” This showed that the graded signal alone was
not sufficient to kick-start the proper number of cells, but
instead needed help from apontic.
<p>Once the team discovered that apontic is important for
getting these cells to move, they set out to figure out how
apontic works. Collaborating with mathematician Hans Meinhardt,
Ph.D., a professor emeritus at the Max Planck Institute in
Germany, they designed a computer model that could simulate how
graded signals are converted to commands that tell cells to move
or to stay.
<p>By making certain assumptions about each gene and assigning
functions to each protein, the team built a simple circuit that
can predict a cell’s behavior using the graded signal, apontic,
and another previously discovered protein called slbo
(pronounced “slow-bo”). The computer model shows that in a cell,
the graded signal turns on both apontic and slbo. But apontic
and slbo work against and battle each other: when one gains a
slight advantage, the other weakens, which in turn causes the
first to gain an even bigger advantage. This continues until one
dominates in each cell. If slbo wins, the cell moves but if
apontic wins, the cell stays put; thus a clear separation
between move or stay is achieved.
<p>“Not only is this a new solution to the problem of how to
create a pattern out of no pattern, but we have also discovered
that apontic is a new regulator of cell migration,” says Montell.
<p>Cell migration likely underlies the spreading of cancer cells
beyond an original tumor to other areas of the body.
Understanding and therefore being able to manipulate the cell
migration pathway could potentially prevent the development of
these new tumors. At this stage, Montell says, “it’s more about
just understanding what the positive and negative regulators of
cell migration are.”
<p>The research was funded by the American Cancer Society and
the National Institutes of Health.

Cell. Authors on the paper are Starz-Gaiano, Mariana Melani,
