color:black'>OK.&nbsp; Let’s start with a quick experiment.<p>

<i>[Hold out your hand with a coin in it.&nbsp; Show it to the audience.&nbsp;
Let it fall.&nbsp; Do this again.&nbsp; Hold out a third coin.]</i><p>

If I were to do this again, what do you think would happen?&nbsp; If we could get ten good Christians to pray
that this next coin wouldn’t fall, would it still fall?&nbsp; How about one thousand Muslims?&nbsp; How about one
billion people of any faith?&nbsp; I think that it would still fall.&nbsp; <i>[Drop the third coin.]</i>&nbsp; Our
understanding of the world around us, and our abilities to predict what will happen are based on naturalism — the
basis of science.&nbsp; Naturalism is how all people live their lives most of the time.<p>

OK, let’s do a thought experiment.&nbsp; If I were to take two coins and glue them together, then drop them at
the same time as I drop a single coin, would they fall twice as fast as the single coin?&nbsp; Aristotle thought
so 2300 years ago, and for over 1900 years, his ideas were what was taught about this and many other subjects.<p>

<br><h3>Galileo and Empirical Science</h3>

Around 1600, Galileo had a new idea.&nbsp; He decided to do something that now seems like common sense — to actually
test the idea of what we now call gravity.&nbsp; He reasoned that two weights held together would fall at the same
rate as one weight.&nbsp; Then he did experiments.&nbsp; And, guess what?&nbsp; It was true!&nbsp; This was the start
of real empirical science, and our collective understanding of the Universe hasn’t been the same since.<p>

Galileo also took the new invention of the telescope, refined it, and used it to look at the night sky.&nbsp; He was
astounded.&nbsp; On the moon he could see mountains and valleys.&nbsp; It wasn’t just some strange heavenly object;
it was probably made out of the same stuff as Earth.&nbsp; In 1609 Galileo looked at Jupiter, and discovered that
it had four moons.&nbsp; If moons orbited Jupiter, then not everything orbited the Earth, as the Catholic Church
taught at the time.&nbsp; Astronomy made more sense if the theories of Copernicus were true, and the Earth and
planets orbited the sun.&nbsp; After writing a book about this, Galileo was called to Rome in 1633 by the
Catholic Church's Inquisition, and told to recant his heretical ideas.<p>

This was no “simple request” by the Church.&nbsp; Just 33 years before, the Inquisition had executed Galileo’s
friend Giordano Bruno.&nbsp; Have you heard of him?&nbsp; In 1600, the Christian authorities in Rome took him
out of the dungeon he had been in for eight years, drove a nail through his tongue, tied him to a metal post, put
wood and some of his books under his feet, and burned him to death.&nbsp; Bruno’s crime was writing ideas that the
Catholic leaders didn’t like — there might be other worlds with other intelligent beings on them, Jesus didn’t
possess god-like power, and souls can’t go to heaven.&nbsp; For these heretical ideas, the Catholic Church punished
this brilliant thinker with a slow, agonizing death.<p>

Galileo knew what he was up against.&nbsp; For the crime of heresy the Inquisition could put him in a dungeon,
torture or even execute him.&nbsp; So, after a long trial, this proud 70-year-old man obediently got on his knees
and recanted.&nbsp; But even after recanting, he was still sentenced to house arrest for the rest of his life.&nbsp;
The Catholic Church officially condemned heliocentrism in 1664, when Pope Alexander VII banned all books that
affirmed the earth's motion.&nbsp; But, even as powerful as the Church was, they could not hold back the
tidal wave of scientific discovery, and the Church eventually lost its battle over our view of the Universe.&nbsp;
It only took them over three hundred years to admit it.&nbsp; In 1992, after 12 years of deliberations,
they grudgingly noted that Galileo had been right in supporting the theories of Copernicus.&nbsp; But no such
admission has been made for Bruno, and his writings are still on the Vatican's list of forbidden texts.<p>

<br><h3>God of the Gaps</h3>

Until just a couple of hundred years ago, most people thought that a god or gods controlled everything.&nbsp; Why
did the wind blow?&nbsp; Why was there lightning and thunder?&nbsp; Why did the sun, moon, and stars apparently go
around the Earth?&nbsp; Why did someone get sick and die?&nbsp; Why did anything happen?&nbsp; <b>Well, obviously, God
did it.</b>&nbsp; If a person doesn’t know how something works or why something happened, they can say, <b>“God did
it.”</b>&nbsp; This is known as the <b>“god of the gaps”</b>, or the <b>“argument from ignorance”</b>, and it is at the
heart of the conflict between science and religion.&nbsp; Science looks for natural causes, while religion looks for
supernatural causes.&nbsp; Science is steadily winning, because as we understand more and more about the Universe, the
gap where God might function grows smaller and smaller.&nbsp; Every time we learn more, God has less room to
operate.&nbsp; When we learned what caused the sun to apparently move across the sky, there was no need for the Greek
god Helios and his chariot.&nbsp; When we understood what caused lightning, there was no need for the Greek god Zeus,
the Roman god Jupiter, or the Norse god Thor.<p>

In fact, the understanding of lightning was one of the first areas of battle between modern science and religion.&nbsp;
When Ben Franklin discovered that lightning was just a big electric spark, he invented the lightning rod.&nbsp; It was
enormously successful at preventing buildings from being struck by lightning.&nbsp; However, this caused a bit of a
problem for the church leaders; should they trust in their god to prevent lightning strikes on their churches, or should
they use these new lightning rods?&nbsp; Up until then, lightning hit churches much more frequently than other, more
deserving buildings — such as taverns or houses of ill repute.&nbsp; “Why was that?” they wondered.&nbsp; Could it be
that churches had spires and were taller, or was it <b><i>SATAN and his WITCHES?</i> ……&nbsp;</b> Actually, that is
what they often believed, and many a supposed witch was burned at the stake for having caused the destruction of a
church.&nbsp; When they started putting lightning rods on churches, witch burnings stopped soon thereafter.&nbsp;
However, the obvious fact is that they were putting their trust in science and lightning rods, not religion and
prayer.<p>

Galileo and others started something big — <b>empirical science</b>.&nbsp; Thru science, we have come to a good
understanding of the workings of the world and Universe around us.&nbsp; The weather, lightning, thunder, the planets
and stars, disease, and life itself all function based on fairly well understood principles.&nbsp; God doesn’t control
them; the physical properties of matter and energy do.&nbsp; This principle is at the center of naturalism — the idea
that only matter and energy exist, and they have properties that are repeatable, understandable, and quantifiable.&nbsp;
We take this idea so for granted, that we typically don’t realize that it is based on several articles of faith.&nbsp;
This faith, however, is quite different from religious faith.&nbsp; This faith is based on past experience and
results.&nbsp; It is the faith that:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<li>There is an external world that exists independently of our minds.
<li>There are understandable, quantifiable, natural laws that describe how things happen in this world.
<li>These natural laws won’t change when we’re not looking; the Universe isn’t totally chaotic.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

So far, this faith has been well founded, as shown by the amazing accomplishments of modern science and
medicine.<o:p></o:p></span><p><br>

<span style='font-size:20.0pt;color:black'>Why God(s)?&nbsp; Why Not?<p></span>
<h3>Examinations of Scientific and Logical Arguments for God(s)</b></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt; color:black'>The idea of an
all-controlling, caring supernatural god is a very attractive one.&nbsp; It can make our mortal lives seem less
frightening, more comforting.&nbsp; Somebody’s in control and won’t let bad things happen to us.<p>

Religious philosophers have tried for thousands of years to prove that there is a god, or many gods.&nbsp; They have
come up with many arguments.&nbsp; We will look at these arguments.&nbsp; Because I live in a largely Judeo-Christian
society, when I refer to a singular God with a capital 'G', I will be referring to the Judeo-Christian god
Yahweh.&nbsp; This god is typically defined as having free will, and being all-knowing (omniscient), all-powerful
(omnipotent), all-good (omnibenevolent) and eternal.&nbsp; This god also is thought to intervene in the physical
world.&nbsp; After all, what good is a god that doesn't <b>do</b> anything?&nbsp; Most of the arguments I use here
will probably also apply to most other of the other 2500 gods created by humankind.&nbsp; I will also closely link
God and religion.&nbsp; I do this advisedly, because, for most people, one could not exist without the other.&nbsp;
In addition, if there were a god, I would think that it would be able to appropriately guide the religions created
for it.<p>

There is at least one religion, essential Buddhism as taught by Buddha, that does not have a god or any
supernatural component.&nbsp; To keep things a bit simpler here, the arguments I make regarding religion will
probably not apply to essential Buddhism.<p>

Why?&nbsp; Why am I doing this?&nbsp; Is it just because I want to poke holes in people’s beliefs so that we can take
away what makes them happy?&nbsp; No, I’m doing this because I want to know what is true, be intellectually honest,
and be open to reality.&nbsp; And, I hope that you are here for the same reasons.<p>

The arguments for the existence of God fall into several areas.&nbsp; I have arranged them into these categories:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<li>mysticism and revelation
<li>scientific claims
<li>morality
<li>appeals to authority
<li>prophesy and miracles
<li>appeals to faith, logic, and emotion.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<br><h3>What Tools Can We Use?</h3>

How can we examine these claims?&nbsp; What tools can we use to determine truth of external reality?&nbsp; We have (1)
<b>logic</b>; and we have (2) empirical, verifiable <b>evidence</b>.&nbsp; Logic and evidence are <b>all</b> we have,
to determine how the Universe really works.&nbsp; These tools have been extraordinarily successful in science and
medicine, and in our daily lives.<p>

Each of us can choose between a magical view of the Universe (one or more invisible gods did it), or the “what you see
is what you get” scientific version.&nbsp; I think that science has done a far better job in explaining how the
Universe works.<p>

<br><h3>Mysticism and Revelation</h3>

Some people claim that there are other ways of knowing, such as mysticism or revelation.&nbsp; How can we verify
these claims?&nbsp; People making them often don't even agree with each other.&nbsp; The only way that I know to
verify any mystic's abilities is for the supposed mystic to be able to accurately, repeatedly, and verifiably know
things that are supposedly impossible to know — such as events of the future.&nbsp; I know of no one who can, or
could.&nbsp; Of course, we have to be very careful in any such testing of skills, because a good magician can
easily fool us.&nbsp; Even if there were somebody who could predict the future, that does not mean that there's
a god.&nbsp; It would only mean that this person has peculiar skills.&nbsp; I submit that mysticism and revelation
result from internal, altered states of consciousness — with no basis in external reality.&nbsp; Mysticism and
revelation can only count for those who experience them; for all other people, they are merely hearsay.&nbsp;
Thus, we can't depend on mysticism or religious revelation to give us reliable answers to any issues.<p>

<br><h3>Scientific Arguments for God(s)</h3>

The biggest weakness in using God to explain anything scientifically is that the explanation is not falsifiable,
and thus not even testable.&nbsp; There is no way to create an experiment to show that it’s wrong.&nbsp; For every
possible set of a test and a result, we could simply say, <b>“God did it.”</b>&nbsp; Why do the Earth and Universe
appear to be so old?&nbsp; <b>God did it.</b>&nbsp; Why does nature seem so balanced?&nbsp; <b>God did it.</b>&nbsp;
Once again, why does anything happen?&nbsp; If we say that <b>God did it</b>, there is no reason or opportunity to
learn how the world really works.&nbsp; If we had stayed with God as the cause of all events, our modern culture
would have been impossible.&nbsp; We would have no real science, engineering, or medicine; we would still be living
in the Dark Ages.<p>

The “god of the gaps” is the basic premise behind all the “scientific” arguments for the existence of a god.&nbsp;
The logic of&nbsp; “god of the gaps” goes like this:&nbsp; Isn't X amazing!&nbsp; I don't understand how X
could be, without something else (that I don't really understand either) making or doing X.&nbsp; This
something else must be a god because I can't come up with a better explanation.<p>

The obvious main fault of&nbsp; “god of the gaps” is its supposition that current lack of knowledge on a subject
means that it can't be known.&nbsp; If this applies to an individual, it's usually just due to an unwillingness
to study the subject.&nbsp; For the fringe areas of knowledge that we don't understand, there is no indication
that we won't learn the secrets of nature.&nbsp; As we have all seen, science has made excellent
advances in our physical understanding of the Universe, and will, no doubt, continue to do so.<p>

There are two common “god of the gaps” types of arguments for the existence of God.&nbsp; We
have (1) First Cause, and we have (2) Intelligent Design, which grew out of creationism.<p>

<br><h3>First Cause Argument</h3>

The first cause argument says that everything has a cause, and, since we supposedly can’t have an infinite
series of causes stretching into the past, God must be the first cause — an uncaused cause.&nbsp;
This argument has at least three problems.<p>

The main problem of the first cause argument is the idea that every event has a cause.&nbsp;
As we discovered in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the Universe is actually ruled at the bottom
level by quantum mechanics, in which it's possible for events to have no cause.&nbsp;
An obvious example of quantum mechanics in action is the radioactive decay of a uranium
atom.&nbsp; There is no previous cause for each such event, and we can only predict it with probability.&nbsp; The
averaging of quantum effects gives us the Newtonian experience that we have, but Newtonian physics does not control
the Universe; quantum mechanics does.&nbsp; We now know that the Universe has an intrinsic, bottom level of
uncertainty that cannot be bypassed.&nbsp; Quantum mechanics also shows us that objects can appear out of nothing
and then disappear back into nothing.&nbsp; Even in supposedly empty space, virtual particles are continuously
appearing and disappearing.&nbsp; This is a real and measurable process.&nbsp; The physicist and cosmologist Alan
Guth has put forth the theory that the Universe itself may be just the result of a random quantum event called a
vacuum fluctuation — with no cause, created out
of nothing, and with a total energy of zero.&nbsp; Even tho this doesn't make sense in the Newtonian physics of our
experience of the world, it does make sense in quantum mechanics and Einstein's relativity.&nbsp; In relativity,
gravity is negative energy and matter is positive energy.&nbsp; Because the two seem to be equal in absolute total
value, our Universe appears balanced to the sum of zero.&nbsp; Our Universe could thus have come into existence
without violating conservation of mass and energy.&nbsp; And, there is excellent empirical and theoretical evidence
to support this.&nbsp; Even if Alan Guth is eventually shown to be wrong, that doesn't mean that “God did it.”<p>

The next problem of the first cause argument is its assumption that an infinite chain of events is
impossible.&nbsp; Many cosmologists have proposed that our Universe could be part of a much larger,
super and perhaps eternal Universe; we certainly don't know for sure, and may never know.&nbsp; However, this
super, possibly eternal Universe would allow infinite chains of events.<p>

The last problem with the first cause argument lies in its assumption that this eternal god exists, something that
it is trying to prove.&nbsp; This is known as begging the question.&nbsp; Even a child can ask, “If God created the
Universe, then who created God?”&nbsp; If the answer is that God is uncaused, then the same answer could certainly
be applied to the existence of the Universe — that<b><i> it </i></b>is uncaused.&nbsp; Besides, which god are we
talking about?&nbsp; People using the first cause argument always make the assumption that the particular god that
did the creating is their god.&nbsp; Muslims think that Allah created the Universe.&nbsp; Hindus think that
Brahma did the creating.&nbsp; Christians think that their god Yahweh did it.&nbsp; Most religions have a story
of how their god created the Universe.&nbsp; The idea of a god as
creator of the Universe obviously tells us little about the characteristics of that god.&nbsp; What they
are doing is explaining one unknown with another unknown, and it just doesn’t make sense.<p>

<br><h3>Intelligent Design and Creationism</h3>

The next scientific type of argument is called Intelligent Design.&nbsp; It states that life on Earth had a
designer that was intelligent.&nbsp; This argument has evolved from the creationism argument, and it’s gaining
strength.&nbsp; To get around restrictions on teaching religious dogma, proponents of intelligent design sometimes
say that they don’t know what this designer was; it could have been an alien or a god.&nbsp; I find this
disingenuous; if it was an alien, then the obvious question is, where and how did the alien originate?&nbsp; If
they really mean God, which is what I think they mean, then it devolves back to creationism.&nbsp; So, I will treat
intelligent design and creationism as the same idea.<p>

Proponents of creationism make many claims:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<li>A watch requires a watchmaker.
<li>A design requires a designer.
<li>The physical laws require a lawgiver.
<li>The complexity of life and the Universe require a cause that is not part of this natural world.
<li>The laws of physics were fine-tuned for life.
<li>Our system of life on Earth was designed.<br>
<li>The 2<sup>nd</sup> law of thermodynamics proves that evolution is impossible.
<li>What they really claim is <b>God did it!</b>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Let’s start with the 2<sup>nd</sup> law of thermodynamics.&nbsp; This states that any closed system will tend toward
disorder.&nbsp; However, it does <b>not</b> apply to the Earth, because we live in an open system with energy
constantly streaming in from our sun.&nbsp; This is the energy that powers almost all life on our planet.<p>

Next, let’s consider the laws of physics.&nbsp; They are quantified explanations of how matter and energy behave,
not anything like man-made laws.&nbsp; We currently don’t know why the parameters of matter and energy have certain
values, but that doesn’t mean that some god set them that way.&nbsp; The simple solution to the question of the source
of the laws of physics is to accept them as brute fact, with no source.&nbsp; Besides, if it were true that a god set
up the Universe for life and us to exist, he certainly had to wait a long time for the result.&nbsp; The Universe
has been around for about 13 billion years.&nbsp; It took about nine billion years before our Earth was formed, and
single celled bacteria were forming ecosystems about a billion years after that.&nbsp; Life on Earth evolved and
became more complex.&nbsp; Then humans, God’s supposed reason for the whole creation, finally came along within the
last hundred thousand years or so.&nbsp; This seems like a lengthy and complex process for an omnipotent being that
could have simply snapped everything into existence.&nbsp; Using God as the source of the laws of physics just
doesn’t make sense.&nbsp; Once again, religionists are trying to explain one unknown with another unknown.<p>

Life is a process — not a design.&nbsp; It requires an explanation — not an intelligent designer.&nbsp;
This explanation is the fact and theories of evolution.&nbsp; It’s a fact that enormous changes to life on Earth
have occurred.&nbsp; The fossil record is clear and unambiguous on this.&nbsp; The theories of evolution explain
the processes that caused these changes.&nbsp; The evidence for evolution of life is overwhelming and
conclusive.&nbsp; This evidence is not just in the fossils, but also in the the body parts and genes of every
living thing.&nbsp; If you have any doubts, take a little time to learn the theories of evolution,
then spend a few hours in any
natural history museum or public library.&nbsp; If your mind is at all open, you will see the evidence.&nbsp;
Remember, ignorance of how evolution works is no argument against it.&nbsp; The basic theories of evolution are
completely solid, and will continue to be updated as we learn more about the complex history of life.<p>

You don't even need to go to a natural history museum or library to see evidence for evolution; our own
bodies have many signs of our evolutionary heritage.&nbsp; When we get goose bumps, our bodies are trying to keep
warm by raising hairs that no longer help.&nbsp; The ability to wiggle ears is of no use for us, but not for some
distant ancestors.&nbsp; We also have many useless, vestigial organs such as nipples on males, the appendix and the
tailbone, which is just a holdover from when our primate ancestors actually had tails millions of years ago.<p>

In fact, just about every cell in our bodies contains the evidence of our evolutionary origins.&nbsp; The basic
process of life on Earth is so common that we share about 50% of our genes with carrots, and more than 98% of our
genes with chimpanzees.&nbsp; Here are some useful biological facts:<br>
<li>We get an exact copy of the mitochondria in each cell from our mother.
<li>Every male gets an exact copy of his Y chromosome from his father.
<li>Both the mitochondria and Y chromosomes slowly mutate over time at a known rate.<p>

With this knowledge, geneticists can estimate how recently any two of us shared a common female ancestor, or
any two males shared a common male ancestor.&nbsp; Using this information and other data, the evidence strongly
points to the claim that most or all of us are descended from a group of Africans that started migrating about
100,000 years ago.<p>

The faults in the design of the human eye, especially, show its evolutionary origins.&nbsp; <i>[Show eye
diagram.]</i>&nbsp; When we study the retina at the back of the eye, we can see that the cell layers are
backwards.&nbsp; Light has to travel through seven layers of cells before reaching the light sensing cells.&nbsp;
Then the signals go back through these layers to the nerves on the inside surface.&nbsp; A truly intelligent designer
could have done better than the human eye.&nbsp; In fact, evolution did a better job with the eyes of the octopus and
squid, which have the light sensing cells on the surface, where they should be.<p>

Let me address a common example that creationists use.&nbsp; <i>[Go to eye diagram again.]</i>&nbsp;
“Look at the wonderful design of the human eye,” they say.&nbsp; “Surely this design could not have happened by
chance.&nbsp; It must be that <b>God did it</b>.”&nbsp; Actually, it did happen by
chance — countless little chance events of changes in the gene pool over millions of generations, all controlled by
the harsh reality of natural selection and survival of the fittest.&nbsp; While the initial changes in the gene pool
were chance events, survival of the fittest is obviously not random.&nbsp; This is the heart of the basic theory of
evolution; individuals can pass their genes and characteristics on to their offspring.&nbsp; If a gene makes an
individual more likely to have offspring that survive, its offspring that carry that gene will be more likely to have
offspring that survive.&nbsp; In effect, species <b>are</b> designed to fit their environment.&nbsp; The designer is
the blind process of evolution, however, not some god.<p>

You’ve probably heard people say that evolution is “only a theory.”&nbsp; It’s important to remember that the term
“theory” in science is not the same as it is in general usage.&nbsp; Basically, a scientific theory is a unifying
<b>concept that explains</b> a large body of data.&nbsp; The theories of evolution have as much validity as the
theory of gravity, atomic theory, or the germ theory of disease.<p>

Even more basic than evolution is the field of science called abiogenesis, which deals with the origins of life
from non-life.&nbsp; Simple experiments have shown that amino acids, the molecular units that make up proteins,
can be made in lab conditions simulating Earth's early atmosphere.&nbsp; Amino acids are even found in
outer space.&nbsp; Amino acids are not living, but abiogenesis scientists are learning many ways that life
could have originated from amino acids.<p>

There is an underlying problem with the design argument, and most creationists probably aren’t aware of it.&nbsp; By
assuming that living things have some sort of metaphysical purpose, they are intrinsically assuming what they want to
prove.&nbsp; Purpose is a human concept.&nbsp; In the Universe, I maintain, things have no intrinsic purpose; they just
exist.&nbsp; Does an atom have any purpose?&nbsp; Does a rock?&nbsp; Does a star?&nbsp; Does an amoeba, plant or any
living thing have a real external purpose?&nbsp; We could say that living things have the purpose of procreating, of
creating more life.&nbsp; However, we must realize that this is just our viewpoint, our interpretation.&nbsp; Rocks,
trees, people, and the Universe have no intrinsic purpose.&nbsp; We can create purpose for ourselves, and that is good;
but it’s important to understand that purpose is a human construct.&nbsp; Remember, when creationists begin their
arguments by noting the design and purpose of nature, they are assuming what they want to prove.&nbsp; Don't be
fooled by this logic slight of hand.<p>

A basis for the creationism idea is the concept that humans are at the center of the Universe.&nbsp; The idea of
God used to make sense, when people thought that the Earth was the unmoving center of creation, and humans were
the reason that there was an Earth and everything else.&nbsp; The biblical Universe was much simpler then.&nbsp;
The Earth was at the base, and above was the vast solid dome called the firmament.&nbsp; It contained the stars
and held back the celestial waters.&nbsp; Above that were heaven and God.<p>

We now know that the Universe is almost unimaginably immense, complex, and ancient.&nbsp; It is the height
of conceit for humans to believe that this whole Universe was made just for us.&nbsp; Our perspective has
changed.&nbsp; We are no longer at the center of the Universe — not our planet, not our star, and not even our
galaxy.&nbsp; As people grow and mature, one of the big realizations is that they aren’t at the center.&nbsp; It
is the same for our species; it is time for us to realize that we are not at the center either.<p>

It is also necessary to note that in order for creationism to be true, these areas of science would be largely
false: evolutionary biology, paleobiology, cosmology, physics, paleontology, archeology, historical geology,
zoology, botany, and biogeography, plus much of early human history.&nbsp; These fields of science make predictions
and get results.&nbsp; Creationism makes no verifiable predictions and gets no useful results, and thus cannot
in any way be called a science.&nbsp; A simple example of this is the field of oil exploration, where you won't
find any creationist geologists — because they don't get results.&nbsp; And, with large amounts of money at stake,
the companies want results.<p>

Studies have shown that most people say that they base their belief in God on the design argument.&nbsp; I think that
this is why creationists are putting so much energy into promoting their view.&nbsp; They realize that if the design
argument were to fall, people might have to rethink their belief in God.<p>

<br><h3>Argument from Morality</h3>

How about morality?&nbsp; Some people say that we need an absolute morality, and that we all have a sense of
morality.&nbsp; They say that the only possible source for this morality is God.<p>

Many people have claimed that humans could not have created morality, that there is nothing in evolution or
history that mandates it.&nbsp; This is wrong.&nbsp; In order for any social species to function, implicit or
explicit rules of interaction are necessary.&nbsp; This is the basic function of morality — rules of interaction
that allow us to function cooperatively.&nbsp; Groups of our distant ancestors that had individuals who were
cooperative and altruistic would be more likely to succeed.&nbsp; Groups that didn't cooperate would be less
likely to succeed.&nbsp; True morality is a human construct; it comes from basic human kindness and our need to
work cooperatively.&nbsp; Morality exists only because we create it.<p>

It's also been claimed that humans could not have had the concept of morality.&nbsp;
I don't see why not.&nbsp; We're fairly intelligent.&nbsp; Human minds have created many ideas that are far more
complex than morality.&nbsp; Why should morality be different?<p>

Let's look at what happens when people claim to get absolute morality from a god.&nbsp; I say that such religious
absolutists don't have morality; what they have is a code of obedience, which is not the same.&nbsp; God sets
what is supposedly moral, and they obey.&nbsp; If God were to say that murder and theft were moral, people would
have to kill and steal to act morally.&nbsp; Actually, this is exactly what is happening with the suicide bombers
in the Middle East.&nbsp; This is also what was behind the Crusades, the Inquisitions and 9/11.&nbsp; The fact that
we find this so abhorrent shows that morality does not come from a god.&nbsp; God fails the morality test.<p>

A large problem that religious absolutists face is where to get the word of their god or gods.&nbsp; They can get
it from divine revelation or from supposedly “holy” books.&nbsp; Each of these sources faces a problem; how do we
know that this is the true word of the god?&nbsp; I've already discussed revelation, so let's look at the idea of
a holy book.&nbsp; I am most familiar with the Christian Bible, so that's what I'll address.<p>

The Bible is touted by many as a source of ultimate knowledge and morality.&nbsp; It is said to be God’s words
to humankind.&nbsp; Have you ever read it?&nbsp; It contradicts itself in many places, is often difficult or
impossible to interpret, and is largely simply boring.&nbsp; Some of it looks to me like it was written under
the influence of hallucinogens.&nbsp; It contains two very different sets of Ten Commandments and three sets of
paternal ancestors for Jesus (with one lineage just being the Holy Ghost).&nbsp; The better-known set of Ten
Commandments even says that children can be punished for the sins of their great-grandfathers!&nbsp; The
lesser-known set reminds us that we must not cook a young goat in its mother's milk.&nbsp; The story of Jesus'
lineage is also confusing.&nbsp; If Joseph didn't impregnate Mary, then why did the Bible's authors try twice
to list Joseph's ancestors? (Matthew 1:1-16, Luke 3:23-38)<p>

The Christian Bible has the purported histories of many rapes, slaughters, and other mass killings, most of
them apparently condoned by God.&nbsp; They even note how the pregnant women were sliced open (Hosea 13:16)
— so much for God being against abortion.&nbsp; In one story that you all know, God drowned almost everyone
and everything on the planet merely because he didn’t like the activities of some of the people in his
creation.&nbsp; In another story, 42 children were killed in the name of God, just for calling a man
bald.&nbsp; In addition, the bible prescribes the death penalty for many supposed “sins” that most of us
don't even consider to be very wrong, such as working on Sunday.&nbsp; Do these tales and penalties show the
actions of a loving god?&nbsp; God seems to be more of a capricious, vindictive, schizophrenic mass murderer
than a paragon of moral virtue, and Satan comes off as the good guy.&nbsp; After all, how many people did
<b>Satan</b> kill?&nbsp; For those of you who still think that morality should come from the Christian Bible,
I ask, what do you think about slavery and child abuse?&nbsp; Not once in the entire Bible is slavery or
child abuse condemned, not even in the writings about
Jesus.&nbsp; In fact both are condoned in many places.&nbsp; Even Jesus had recommendations about beating and
killing slaves (Luke 12:42-48).&nbsp; I would bet that any one of you could do a better job of defining morals
than what is in the Bible.&nbsp; The Christian Bible, its god, and its savior all fail the morality test.<p>

What about the historical veracity of the Christian Bible?&nbsp; People say that archeological evidence shows
that some places and people mentioned in the Bible really existed; therefore the Bible is true.&nbsp; This is
like saying that <i>Gone With the Wind</i> is true because the Civil War actually occurred.&nbsp; Let's look
at one biblical personage — King Herod the Great, who ruled from 39 - 4 BCE.&nbsp; His supposed slaughter of
the innocents is not mentioned by any historian of the time, and is thus a complete fabrication.<p>

<i>Jesus died for our sins.</i>&nbsp; This is one of the primary moral points of Christianity, and it is formally
known as substitutive sacrifice.&nbsp; It was practiced by many religions, when they killed sacrificial animals or
humans on altars.&nbsp; What kind of morality is this, where one person has to die because of what others have
done?&nbsp; When we look at cultures that sacrificed animals or humans, we call them barbaric and primitive.&nbsp;
It makes no difference if the person being sacrificed agrees; it is still blatantly, repugnantly immoral.<p>

Using religion as a source for morality completely collapses when we look at religious positions now and in
history.&nbsp; There are religious people with different positions on such moral issues as the death penalty,
abortion, and women’s rights.&nbsp; How can this be, if they all get the same divine words from the same
god?&nbsp; Racism, misogyny, and slavery were once considered perfectly moral by large portions of humankind,
and were seen as having a religious basis.&nbsp; Also, the killings done in the name of God, by most religions,
are legendary.&nbsp; Thus religion cannot give us the answers to these moral issues.&nbsp; Our culture has
changed, along with our laws, and these evils are no longer acceptable in modern society.&nbsp; Morality
is a social and legal construct, not a religious one.&nbsp; Religion fails the morality test.<p>

<br><h3>Argument from Authority</h3>

I think that most people begin their belief in God because something or someone said that God exists.&nbsp; This is
called the “argument from authority.”&nbsp; We just discussed the Bible as one of these sources.&nbsp; There are
other sources for other religions, such as the Koran for the Muslims.<p>

What does it mean, when we believe something based on an authority?&nbsp; It means that we are taking something or
someone else’s words as truth.&nbsp; We all do this for most subjects, because we can’t be experts on everything.&nbsp;
Our first authorities are the people who raise us.&nbsp; This is because we are born with no innate knowledge of the
world, and have to learn it from scratch.&nbsp; We soon start learning from other sources, such as friends, teachers,
books and other written material.&nbsp; As we learn, we develop a map in our minds of what the world is like.&nbsp;
This map becomes a truth filter.&nbsp; When we look at a new idea, we typically compare it to the mental map that we
have.&nbsp; If the idea fits well in the map, we can add it.&nbsp; If the idea doesn’t fit, we have a problem.&nbsp;
We must either throw out the idea, or make a change to the map.&nbsp; Change is difficult and often painful, so most
people tend to throw out ideas that don’t fit their mental map.<p>

When we use someone or something as an authority, we often bypass the comparison process, and plug the new ideas
directly into the map.&nbsp; This can save us a lot of mental work.&nbsp; However, it also opens us to believing in
things and ideas that aren’t true.&nbsp; Since we can’t be experts on everything, we thus have a problem — what
and whom can we implicitly believe?&nbsp; For me, since I want my mental map to be as accurate as possible, I have
chosen the methods of science and reason as my ultimate authority.&nbsp; Science and reason have been shown to be
the best predictors of how the world functions.&nbsp; Science and reason aren’t perfect, but they are
self-correcting.&nbsp; Other sources of authority are too prone to misinformation.<p>

One large difference between science and religion is this:&nbsp; In science, if the facts don't fit the theory,
the theory is tossed out.&nbsp; In religion, if the facts don't fit the theory, the facts are tossed out.<p>

<br><h3>Argument from Prophesy and Miracles</h3>

Now, let’s discuss prophesy and miracles.&nbsp; I am continually astounded at just how little evidence people
are willing to accept for proof of these.&nbsp; Prophesies that did come true are often easy to explain, once
you understand that it’s easy to predict something if it has already occurred, or that actions were done merely
to fulfill prophesy, or that events or prophesies were fabricated.&nbsp; There are also many prophesies that haven’t
come true.&nbsp; As for religious miracles, the evidence is so slim that they should be relegated to hearsay.&nbsp;
As Carl Sagan said, “Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.”&nbsp; With this in mind, which is more
likely, that true prophesies and miracles have actually occurred, or that they are just tall tales?<p>

Even if truly inexplicable 'prophesies' or 'miracles' have occurred, that does not mean that there's a god.&nbsp;
It could just mean that a person has peculiar skills or technological help that we don't understand.&nbsp; We all
can imagine how easy it would be to go to a primitive tribe of humans and impress them with 'god-like' skills
that are the result of our technology, medicine, or knowledge.&nbsp; It's reasonable to consider that we could
be fooled by technology that is far in advance of our own.&nbsp; As famous science fiction author Sir Arthur C.
Clarke wrote, “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”<p>

Let’s consider one well-known miracle, the resurrection of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; First, there is absolutely
<b>no</b> verifiable evidence that Jesus ever even lived.&nbsp; Second, even if he did exist, there is <b>no</b>
verifiable evidence that he actually <b>died</b> on the cross.&nbsp; This makes Jesus’ supposed ‘resurrection’
much more possible in a purely natural sense.<p>

<br><h3>Argument from Religious Faith</h3>

Next, let’s look at religious faith.&nbsp; What is faith?&nbsp; It is the firm belief in something for which no
proof exists.&nbsp; As Mark Twain once said, “Faith is believing what you know ain't so.”&nbsp; Religious faith proves
nothing, except the bullheadedness of the believer.&nbsp; If you have faith, you don’t need proof.&nbsp; If you have
proof, you don’t need faith.&nbsp; Therefore, any attempt to use faith as a basis for proof is intrinsically doomed
to failure.&nbsp; A recent example of absolute faith and its possible consequences can illustrate the objective
failures of religious faith.&nbsp; I ask you, on September 11, 2001, whose faith was the most effective?&nbsp; I say
that it was the suicidal pilots of those three planes that crashed into the buildings.&nbsp; If you believe in the
primacy of religious faith, there is no way to differentiate between yours and theirs, for it is all
purely subjective.&nbsp; Religious faith fails as a proof for God.<p>

<br><h3>Logical Arguments for God(s)</h3>

How about logical arguments for the existence of God?&nbsp; Let’s look at a proof for God that relies on reason
alone.&nbsp; It is called the <b>ontological argument</b>, and it basically says that God exists because we can
conceive of God.&nbsp; One of the characteristics of God is existence; therefore, God exists.&nbsp; This argument
is so obtuse that it’s ridiculous.&nbsp; It is just confusion between the existence of ideas and the existence of
real things.&nbsp; Simply saying that something (like Satan, Jesus or God) exists does not make it exist.&nbsp; All
that exist are the ideas (in our minds) of Satan, Jesus or God.<p>

There are some people who claim that God is the source of logic, therefore we can't even use logic without
presupposing the existence of God.&nbsp; They say that logic can't be created from unformed matter; therefore God
formed the matter and created logic.&nbsp; This argument is known as <b>presuppositionalist</b>, or the
<b>Transcendental Argument for the Existence of God</b>.&nbsp; The names are fancy, and my response is simple.&nbsp;
Logic is a pattern of thinking, and patterns can emerge from simple rules.&nbsp; There are many examples of complex
patterns coming out of simple rules, such as snowflakes and waves forming.&nbsp; There is nothing in our everyday
experience that indicates that some higher power is necessary for these patterns, and there is nothing that proves that
a god is necessary for the patterns we call logic.&nbsp; Additionally, the presuppositionalist argument gives little
indication as to the qualities of the god it presupposes — much like the first cause argument.&nbsp; The argument
is just another way of answering a supposedly difficult question with the simple response, <b>“God did it.”</b><p>

If anything is not logical, it is most religions.&nbsp; I am most familiar with Christianity, so let's look at its
basic claims:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<li>A supernatural god exists that created everything and intervenes in the natural world.
<li>This god had a son whose mother was a virgin.
<li>This son did many miracles, including making a dead person alive again.
<li>This son was killed, and came back to life one and a half (not three) days later.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

There is not any empirical, verifiable evidence for any of this.&nbsp; There is also much experience from everyday
life that virgins can't get pregnant (without modern medicine) and that people who have been dead for a while can't
come back to life.&nbsp; Thus, belief in the above claims is illogical.<p>

There is an argument for belief in God that is called <b>Pascal’s Wager</b>, named for Blaise Pascal who conceived
it.&nbsp; The argument goes like this:&nbsp; Either there is a god or there isn’t.&nbsp; If you believe in God, and
God exists, then you win big time and go to heaven.&nbsp; If you don’t believe in God, and God exists, you lose big
time and go to hell.&nbsp; If there is no god, then you haven’t lost much by believing.&nbsp; So the obvious choice
is to believe in God, because it’s simply the best bet.<p>

Pascal’s Wager has several faults.&nbsp; The biggest problem is that it’s not a proof of any god’s existence;
it’s just an argument for believing, a method of extorting the gullible thru fear.&nbsp; Like many other such
arguments we have discussed, it also fails to denote exactly which god it refers to.&nbsp; Pascal’s Wager could
be applied to any god that offers rewards and punishments.&nbsp; Taken to extreme, following the wager would
necessitate betting on the god with the worst hell, so it could be avoided.<p>

Another problem with Pascal’s Wager is that it completely ignores intellectual integrity and honesty.&nbsp;
As an example, let’s talk about belief in Santa Claus.&nbsp; Don’t we have more respect for a child who figures
out that Santa doesn’t exist, and says so, rather than continuing to lie so he can get more presents?&nbsp; It's a
sign of growing integrity and maturity for children to stop believing in Santa.&nbsp; Similarly, adults
can give up belief in a god when they realize that there's no real evidence for their god.<p>

<br><h3>Comfort and Emotion</h3>

I think that many people continue to believe in a god because it gives them comfort; it’s an <b>emotional</b>
response.&nbsp; It allows them to pray to their god, and think that they’re actually accomplishing something.&nbsp;
It gives them feelings of structure and meaning in their lives, and makes them feel connected.&nbsp; It helps
remove the fear of death and nonexistence that most of us experience.&nbsp; Belief in the Christian god helps
remove people's fear of Christian hell that has been pounded into their minds.&nbsp; Belief in a god also makes
the world more black and white, less confusing, and easier to deal with.&nbsp; But, is this any actual proof
for the existence of a god?&nbsp; Is <b>comfort</b> a good indicator of the truth of external reality?&nbsp; I don’t
think that it is.&nbsp; George Bernard Shaw said it best.&nbsp; “The fact that a believer is happier than
a skeptic is no more to the point than the fact that a drunken man is happier than a sober one.&nbsp; The
happiness of credulity is a cheap and dangerous quality.”<p>

<br><h3>Belief in God, and How it Affects Our World</h3>

This question about the existence of a god is not merely a philosophical exercise; it has pertinent applications to
the world in which we live.&nbsp; I will talk about four areas — education, politics, medicine, and everyday life.<p>

<br><h3>God and Education</h3>

In education, at the same time that we have a rise of fundamentalist religions in the U.S., the youth of America are
scoring lower on scholastic tests.&nbsp; How can many of them learn to think rationally when they are taught, by
their parents or religious schools, such irrational concepts as creationism and invisible, immaterial beings?&nbsp;
Here are some disturbing statistics:<br>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<li>68% of Americans think that we should teach both creationism and evolution in schools.
<li>47% believe that the world is less than 10,000 years old.
<li>40% think that we should teach just creationism in schools.
<li>36% believe in telepathy.
<li>25% believe in astrology.
<li>13% think that Joan of Arc was Noah’s wife.
<li>Only 11% of Americans accept the standard scientific account of evolution.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Belief in an omnipotent deity allows people to use sloppy logic.&nbsp; If they are faced with a difficult question
about why an event occurred, all they have to say is, <b>“God did it.”</b>&nbsp; Then the reason behind the event is a
mystery.&nbsp; This is the old “god of the gaps” answer, and it’s an intellectual cop-out.&nbsp; It answers nothing;
it predicts nothing; and it teaches nothing.&nbsp; To counter this we must ensure that scientific naturalism is taught
in our schools.&nbsp; As students understand better how the world works, their personal gods of the gaps will
diminish.&nbsp; If we want to have a strong democracy, our students and future voters must understand the simple
facts of the world around us, in order to make informed decisions.<p>

<br><h3>God and Politics</h3>

<i>God bless America.</i>&nbsp; We’ve all heard it countless times, especially from politicians.&nbsp;
It is a very dangerous concept, for it can give us the arrogance and invulnerability of
supposedly divine leadership where we can do no wrong.&nbsp; It can also give us the idea that we
have the responsibility to impose our beliefs on other countries — whether they want us to or not.<p>

The Roman leaders used to require that every Roman citizen pray to the Roman gods, to ensure victory for their
armies.&nbsp; There’s an old saying that goes like this:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To the Romans, all religions were equally <b>true.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To the philosophers, all religions were equally <b>false.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To the politicians, all religions were equally <b>useful.</b><p>

Does this sound familiar?&nbsp; Our politicians keep pulling God and religion into politics.&nbsp; President
George W. Bush's mangling of the wall separating state and church is well documented.&nbsp; In 1954, when President
Eisenhower signed the bill adding “under God” to the Pledge of Allegiance, his words explicitly showed that
the idea was to link religiosity and patriotism.&nbsp; In 1988
President Reagan established the National Day of Prayer.&nbsp; On March 27, 2003, House Resolution 153 passed
by an overwhelming vote.&nbsp; It urges the President to issue a proclamation “designating a day for humility,
prayer, and fasting for all people of the United States.”&nbsp; We are “to seek guidance from God to achieve a
greater understanding of our own failings,” and “to gain resolve in meeting the challenges that confront
our nation.”&nbsp; The Senate <b>unanimously</b> passed a similar bill.&nbsp; These government actions violate
the spirit, if not the letter, of the First Amendment.&nbsp; I say that we are becoming a de facto
<b>theocracy</b>.&nbsp; Do you agree?&nbsp; <i>[Pause.]</i><p>

A basic source of incompatibility between religion and democracy lies in how each deals with points of view
that disagree.&nbsp; Religion is usually based on divisive absolutes like right and wrong, good and evil,
God and Satan, us and them.&nbsp; Democracy needs to be based on compromise.&nbsp; This is why democracy
functions best when religion and its divisiveness are kept out of government.<p>

Many religious and political leaders say that our freedoms and liberties come from God.&nbsp; I say that
freedoms do not exist without the ability to enforce them.&nbsp; In the U.S., this power originates in our
Constitution and is implemented by our officials enforcing the Constitution.&nbsp; In many ways, we can say
that our government created our freedoms.&nbsp; If God is the source of freedom, why was there so little of
it before our nation was formed?&nbsp; And, why does it take a government to enforce that freedom?<p>

It’s important to remember that our nation was founded as the first country that derived its power from a purely
secular, nonreligious basis.&nbsp; All nations before then had kings and queens who used their supposed
“God-given divine right” to rule.&nbsp; Instead of this top-down power structure, our founders wisely
created a government that derived its powers from the consent of the governed.&nbsp; They also realized the inherent
divisiveness of religion, and kept it specifically out of our Constitution and government; God is not even mentioned
in our Constitution.&nbsp; Religion is only mentioned twice — both times to keep religion and government
separate.&nbsp; The Treaty of Tripoli, written during the administration of President George Washington,
signed by President John Adams, and <b>unanimously</b> approved by the Senate, stated, “The Government of the
United States is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion.”&nbsp; How could we as a nation have
forgotten such an important fact?&nbsp; <i>[Pause.]</i><p>

<br><h3>God and Medicine</h3>

Let’s look at religion and medicine.&nbsp; Religious leaders have consistently come out against medical advances.
&nbsp;Hundreds of years ago, they were against autopsies and medical use of cadavers for research.&nbsp;
In the 1800’s Christians fought the use of anesthetics on the ground that suffering is God's will and therefore must
be endured.&nbsp; This was particularly true for a woman’s pain during childbirth, because they could quote the Bible
to support their position.&nbsp; Currently, some religious groups prohibit life-saving blood transfusions.
&nbsp; Children die every year because their parents withhold medical treatment, trusting in God instead.&nbsp; Many
religious leaders are preventing access to birth control,
disease prevention, and information about sexuality.&nbsp; They act as though they would prefer to see people dying of
disease and starvation, rather than allow the population to have forbidden products and information.&nbsp; Recently
they have come out against very promising areas of medicine, such as fetal cell research, stem cell research, and
therapeutic cloning.&nbsp; They have also convinced our government that these areas of research should be prohibited
or severely limited.&nbsp; This has real implications for reducing the possible medical treatments available for each
of us.&nbsp; Not all religions want this research limited; but many do, and they fail the medical test.<p>

<br><h3>God and Everyday Life</h3>

Let’s look at God and everyday life.&nbsp; If there really were a personal god, the existence of this god would be an
obvious fact in the Universe.&nbsp; God would be reaching into events in the world, and bypassing the laws of physics
to influence the outcomes.&nbsp; People who lost limbs might have them re-appear.&nbsp; Babies killed in fires might
come back to life.&nbsp; Other true miracles would happen.&nbsp; I've seen none of this, and I'd bet that no one else
here has either.&nbsp; In fact, there is <b>no</b> reliable evidence of any divine intervention, ever!&nbsp; God
fails the reality test of everyday life.<p>

We've looked at religion and education, politics, medicine, and everyday life.&nbsp; “What's the harm in religion?”
some people say.&nbsp; I think that I've shown the harm.&nbsp; Madalyn Murray O'Hair summarized it well when she
said, “Religion has ever been anti-human, anti-woman, anti-life, anti-peace, anti-reason and anti-science.&nbsp;
The god idea has been detrimental not only to humankind but to the earth.&nbsp; It is time now for reason,
education and science to take over.”<p>

<br><h3>God is just an Idea</h3>

What could an invisible, immaterial god be like?&nbsp; This immaterial god would have an immaterial mind, and the
only minds that we have <b>any</b> examples of result from physical brains.&nbsp; The only invisible, immaterial
things that I know of are ideas, like mathematic, scientific and social concepts.&nbsp; Although ideas can be
powerful in moving people to action, they are human creations and have no separate reality.&nbsp; If humankind
were to disappear tomorrow, so would ideas — including the idea of God.<p>

The English language even has a term for this — “reify,” which means “to regard something abstract as real or
concrete.”&nbsp; The god idea is about as abstract as possible, with no real evidence for existence.&nbsp;
However, people have been regarding some god or gods as real for thousands of years.<p>

<br><h3>Proofs, and Qualities of God(s)</h3>

Ultimately though, it’s not necessary to prove that a god doesn’t exist.&nbsp; It is up to the god-believers to
prove that their god or gods exist, for they are making the assertion of the existence of something that is not
immediately visible.&nbsp; For example, if I were to claim that there is an invisible ten-foot tall pink unicorn
in this room, and demand that you feed her, you could justifiably expect some sort of hard proof.&nbsp; The same
concept of proof lies with those who claim that an invisible, immaterial god exists.&nbsp; Thus, even if all proofs
of the nonexistence of gods were to fail, it would still be necessary for theists to prove the actual existence
of their god, if they expect us to take them seriously.<p>

<a name="nogod"></a>
Some people say that we can’t prove that the Christian god doesn’t exist, that to do so we would have to have
absolute knowledge.&nbsp; This is wrong.&nbsp; Depending on how we define a god, it is possible to prove that
it doesn’t exist, just like it is possible to prove that square circles don’t exist.&nbsp; The god of Abraham
is typically defined as having free will, and being all-knowing, all-powerful, all-good and eternal.<p>

It's important to note that these qualities of God were concocted by humans, and have no examples in the real
world — much like the capabilities of Superman.<p>

God's qualities sound pretty good.&nbsp; Unfortunately these attributes are mutually exclusive and can’t all
exist in one being, no matter how supernatural it is.&nbsp; God can’t have free will and be all-knowing and
all-powerful.&nbsp; If God knows the future, God would be unable to change it, and thus could not be
all-powerful.&nbsp;As a simple example, let’s say that God declares what tomorrow’s winning lottery numbers will
be, and writes them down.&nbsp; However, now God can’t change those numbers.&nbsp; God can’t both know the future
and change it.<p>

God also can’t be both all-good and all-powerful, because terrible events really do occur, and this all-loving
god hasn’t prevented them.&nbsp; This is known as the problem of evil, and I think that it is one of the biggest
problems for those attempting to prove the existence of the Christian god.&nbsp; How can anybody explain the
existence of a loving, all-powerful god, while also knowing the bad things that happen to all of us and the
terrible things that happen to far too many?<p>

The ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus summed it up well when he wrote these ideas:<br>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<li>Either God wants to abolish evil, and cannot; or he can and does not want to.
<li>If he wants to, but cannot, he is impotent.
<li>If he can, but does not want to, he is wicked.
<li>If, as they say, God can abolish evil, and God really wants to do it, why is there evil in the world?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

And yet the idea of an all-knowing, all-powerful, and all-good god with free will won’t go away.&nbsp; So, here
we are discussing this subject again.&nbsp; It’s good to remember that there have been over 2500 gods created by
humankind.&nbsp; Monotheists don’t believe in all but one of them.&nbsp; Atheists don’t believe in just one more.<p>

In fact, the existence of honest and kind Atheists is another proof that the Christian god doesn't exist.&nbsp;
If this all-good god existed, it would want everybody to be saved — even Atheists.&nbsp; If this all-knowing god
existed, it would know that Atheists just want real proof of its existence.&nbsp; If this god were all-powerful it
would be able to give unambiguous proof of its existence.&nbsp; It hasn't.&nbsp; Therefore this god doesn't exist.<p>

<br><h3>Atheism, Agnosticism and Humanism</h3>

The Atheist position is that the Universe is understandable and explainable in the naturalistic terms of science
and mathematics.&nbsp; There is no need or reliable evidence to show that any god or gods exist.<p>

Why Atheism and not Agnosticism?&nbsp; Many people say that there still could be a god, that we can’t totally
disprove the existence of all types of gods.&nbsp; That is true, but common Agnosticism ends up splitting hairs and
being intellectually lazy.&nbsp; We’ve seen that there is no reliable evidence that any god exists, especially a
personal god of the Christian/Jewish/Muslim type.&nbsp; This typical personal god would show up in its interactions
with the real, physical world.&nbsp; As I said, there is <b>no</b> empirical evidence of this.&nbsp; Thus, in this
case, absence of evidence <b>is</b> evidence of absence.&nbsp; This leaves only marginal gods that have little or no
interaction with humans and the world.&nbsp; Do we think that the ancient Greek gods still exist?&nbsp; How about the
Roman, Norse or Mayan gods?&nbsp; How about Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny?&nbsp; Of course not.&nbsp; There is no
verifiable evidence for any supernatural guy in a red suit, magic rabbit, or gods.&nbsp; Just like it’s theoretically
possible for a ’57 Chevy to be orbiting Mars, some gods are also theoretically possible, but ridiculously
improbable.&nbsp; So, let’s be honest with ourselves and look at the world with open eyes, as it actually is.<p>

The truth is that we are, each of us, all alone in our minds.&nbsp; Many people have imaginary friends called gods
to make them feel less alone.&nbsp; Some learn to give up their imaginary friends.&nbsp; It's sometimes not easy not
believing, and it is intellectually honest.&nbsp; We Atheists can derive strength from that.&nbsp; People
have been struggling with mortality for thousands of years.&nbsp; Here are three more quotes that I like:<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<li>The first is again from the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus.&nbsp; “Why should I fear death?&nbsp; If I am,
death is not.&nbsp; If death is, I am not.&nbsp; Why should I fear that which can only exist when I do not?”<p>
<li>The scientist/philosopher Carl Sagan wrote, “For me, it is far better to grasp the Universe as it really is
than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring.”<p>
<li>Mark Twain wrote, “I was dead for millions of years before I was born and it never inconvenienced me a bit.”
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Many religious people ask how Atheists can be happy without God.&nbsp; For me and for many Atheists I know, the
realization of our Atheism has been extremely freeing and has opened us to our own happiness.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<li>Atheism gives us the ability to see the Universe as it actually is, without the mental filters of
superstition preventing us from directly experiencing it.
<li>Atheism allows us to experience our selves, without the debasing idea that we are innately sinful.
<li>Atheism gives us the freedom to think for ourselves, to construct our own meanings.&nbsp; We each can choose
what we think has value.
<li>Atheism allows us to experience true interpersonal love, without any supernatural intervention.
<li>Atheism lets us see that we have to make choices about our future.&nbsp; No big daddy god is going to protect
us from bad decisions.
<li>Atheism teaches us to treasure this moment, this life, and this world — because we realize that it’s all we have.<p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Most Atheists are also Secular Humanists.&nbsp; The philosophy of Secular Humanism takes the Atheist position and adds
another layer.&nbsp; It declares that humans are most important, not any imaginary gods.&nbsp; We have the power, thru
love, reason, science, courage, and vision, to solve our problems.&nbsp; We shape our destiny.&nbsp; We are each
capable of personal development and satisfaction.&nbsp; Humanism holds as its highest goal the happiness, fulfillment,
and freedom of all humankind.<p>

This has been a long and involved talk, so I would like to conclude with letting you know the bad news ... and the
good news.&nbsp; The bad news is that there is no god to watch over and care for us.&nbsp; The good news is that
there is no hell, and we can all love and care for each other — if we so choose.</span><p><br>
