<h1>Fossil Find Strengthens Sequence of Human Evolution</h1>
<h2>Location of the discovery explains an early separation
of hominid species</h2>

<p>WASHINGTON - Fossils have
long provided snapshots of the human family tree,
but a new find in Africa gives scientists a kind of
mini home movie showing man's primal development.
<p>Because the
4.2-million-year-old fossil is from the same human
ancestral hot spot in Ethiopia as remains from seven
other human-like species, scientists can now fill in
the gaps for the most complete evolutionary chain so
far.
<p>"We just found the chain of
evolution, the continuity through time," said
Ethiopian anthropologist Berhane Asfaw, co-author of
the study being reported today in the journal
Nature. "One form evolved to another. This is
evidence of evolution in one place through time."
<>The species, <em>Australopithecus anamensis</em>,
is not new, but its location is what helps explain
the giant leap from one early phase of human-like
development to the next, scientists say. All eight
species were found in a region called the Middle
Awash.
<p>"It's like 12 frames of a
home movie, but a home movie covering 6 million
years," said study lead author Tim White,
co-director of Human Evolution Research Center at
University of California at Berkeley. Fossils in the
region cover three major phases of human
development.
<p>"The key here is the
sequences," White said. "It's about a mile thickness
of rocks in the Middle Awash, and in it we can see
all three phases of human evolution."
<p>Modern man belongs to the
genus <em>Homo</em>, a subgroup
in the family of hominids. What evolved into Homo
was likely the genus <em>Australopithecus</em>, which includes the famed 3.2
million-year-old "Lucy" fossil found three decades ago.
<p>A key candidate for the genus
that evolved into Australopithecus is called
<em>Ardipithecus</em>. The
finding is important in bridging — but not
completely — the gap between Australopithecus and
Ardipithecus.
<p>In 1994, a 4.4
million-year-old partial skeleton of the species
<em>Ardipithecus ramidus</em> —
the most recent Ardipithecus species — was found
about six miles from the latest discovery.
<p>"This appears to be the link
between Australopithecus and Ardipithecus as two
different species," White said.
<p>The major noticeable
difference between the phases of man can be seen in
Australopithecus' bigger chewing teeth to eat harder
food, he said.<p><hr><h3 align=center>
