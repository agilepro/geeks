<H2 align=center>Words of Wisdom from George Carlin</H2>
"I would never want to be a member of a group whose symbol was a guy nailed
to two pieces of wood."<br>
- George Carlin (attributed: source unknown)<p>

"I credit that eight years of grammar school with nourishing me in a
direction where I could trust myself and trust my instincts.&nbsp; They gave me
the tools to reject my faith.&nbsp; They taught me to question and think for
myself and to believe in my instincts to such an extent that I just said,
This is a wonderful fairy tale they have going here, but it's not for me."<br>
- George Carlin, in the "New York Times", 8/20/95<p>

"If churches want to play the game of politics, let them pay admission like
everyone else."<br>
- George Carlin (attributed: source unknown)<p>

"Religion: If this [word] offends you, welcome to the world of sane and realistic critical thought.&nbsp;
More harm has been done to the collective human psyche by religion than by all
the fucking and cocksucking since the dawn of time.&nbsp; By the way, many religious
people (including the ordained) fuck and suck each other's cocks all the time."<br>
- George Carlin, from the language warning sequence introducing his
 <a href=http://www.georgecarlin.com>website</a>, that existed in late 2001 and early 2002<p>

"Instead of school busing and prayer in schools, which are both controversial
why not a joint solution?&nbsp; Prayer in buses.&nbsp; Just drive these kids around all
day and let them pray their fuckn' empty little heads off."<br>
- George Carlin, <i>Brain Droppings</i><p>

"I'm completely in favor of the separation of Church and State.&nbsp; My idea is that these two
institutions screw us up enough on their own, so both of them together is certain death."<br>
- George Carlin (attributed: source unknown)<p>

"We created god in our own image and likeness!"<br>
- George Carlin (attributed: source unknown)<p>

"I finally accepted Jesus - not as my personal savior, but as a man I intend to borrow money from."<br>
- George Carlin, <i>Brain Droppings</i><p>

"I've begun worshipping the Sun for a number of reasons.&nbsp; First of all, unlike
some other gods I could mention, I can see the Sun.&nbsp; It's there for me every
day.&nbsp; And the things it brings me are quite apparent all the time: heat,
light, food, a lovely day.&nbsp; There's no mystery, no one asks for money, I don't
have to dress up, and there's no boring pageantry.&nbsp; And interestingly
enough, I have found that the prayers I offer to the sun and the prayers I
formerly offered to God are all answered at about the same 50-percent rate."<br>
- George Carlin, <i>Brain Droppings</i><p>

"Here's another question I've been pondering - what is all this shit about
angels?&nbsp; Have you heard this?&nbsp; Three out of four people belive in angels.&nbsp; Are
you fucking stupid?&nbsp; Has everybody lost their mind?&nbsp; You know what I think it
is?&nbsp; I think it's a massive, collective, psychotic chemical flashback for all the drugs
smoked, swallowed, shot, and obsorbed rectally by all Americans from 1960 to 1990.&nbsp;
Thirty years of street drugs will get you some fucking angels, my friend!"<br>
- George Carlin (attributed: source unknown)<p>

"What about Goblins, huh?&nbsp; Doesn't anybody belive in Goblins?&nbsp; You never hear
about this.&nbsp; Except on Halloween and then it's all negative shit.&nbsp; And what
about Zombies?&nbsp; You never hear from Zombies!&nbsp; That's the trouble with Zombies,
they're unreliable!&nbsp; I say if you're going to go for the Angel bullshit you
might as well go for the Zombie package as well."<br>
- George Carlin<p>

"You are all diseased.&nbsp; I don't have any beliefs or allegiances.&nbsp; I don't believe
in this country.&nbsp; I don't believe in religion, or a god, and I don't believe
in all these man-made institutional ideas."<br>
- George Carlin, quoted from Reuters / Variety "Notable Quotes" for 4/25/01<p>

"I have as much authority as the Pope, I just don't have as many people who believe it."<br>
- George Carlin, <i>Brain Droppings</i><p>

"This is a little prayer dedicated to the separation of church and state.&nbsp; I
guess if they are going to force those kids to pray in schools they might as
well have a nice prayer like this: Our Father who art in heaven, and to the
republic for which it stands, thy kingdom come, one nation indivisible as in
heaven, give us this day as we forgive those who so proudly we hail.&nbsp; Crown
thy good into temptation but deliver us from the twilight's last gleaming.&nbsp;
Amen and Awomen."<br>
- George Carlin, Saturday Night Live<p>

"The two big mistakes were the belief in a sky god- that there's a man in
the sky with 10 things he doesn't want you to do and you'll burn for a long
time if you do them- and private property, which I think is at the core of
our failure as a species.&nbsp; That's the source of my indignations, my
dissatisfactions, however it comes out on the stage.&nbsp; I feel betrayed by the
people I'm part of, these creatures, these magnificent creatures."<br>
- George Carlin, Orange County Register, March 1997<p>

"When it comes to God's existence, I'm not an atheist and I'm not an agnostic.&nbsp;
I'm an acrostic.&nbsp; The whole thing puzzles me."<br>
- George Carlin, <i>When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops?</i><p>

"We use up words like "spiritual" so fast in this culture.&nbsp; Twenty years ago
spiritual" had a distinct meaning.&nbsp; But now there's a lot of jack-off
thinkers who just love to talk about the spiritual.&nbsp; And there is a lot of
bogus- is "bogosity" a word?&nbsp; It should be - a lot of bogosity in these
spiritual seekers.&nbsp; So you have to find another way to express it.&nbsp; I just
call it "how I fit."<br>
- George Carlin, "Orange County Register" March 1997<p>
