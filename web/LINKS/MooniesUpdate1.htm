April 10, 2001 (David Cloud, Fundamental Baptist Information
Service, P.O. Box 610368, Port Huron, MI 48061-0368, fbns@wayoflife.org) -
Cult leader<p>

"Rev." Sun Myung Moon has launched a new ecumenical venture called "We Will
Stand!" It is being promoted by a 50 state tour which
began Feb. 25 in New York City. The tour came to Oklahoma City on April 5, and
Mr. and Mrs. Bruce Smith and I attended the press conference to gather
information about this movement.

<p>Michael Jenkins, President of the Family Federation for
World Peace (the new name for Moon's Unification Church) and the American Clergy
Leadership Conference (another Moon-associated organization), conducted the press
conference. He noted that they are "on a mission to rebuild the family and
to bring the body of Christ together." They intend to
build a coalition of all denominations and races. He said, "There was a time
when the different denominations had a purpose, but now God is raising up
prophets to call upon the 12 tribes of the New Israel to be one body. Jesus is
calling upon all denominations to come together, to break down denominational
walls. There is a new dispensation. New things are being opened up." He
said that Moon is revealing new things, and that Jesus' words are being
understood in new ways today. Another speaker at the press conference, a
"Rev." Medina, said, "It was during a Billy Graham crusade years ago that I lost my
denominational hang-ups."

<p>Participants in "We Will Stand" include Southern
Baptists, Missionary Baptists, Lutherans, Methodists, Catholics, Church of God,
Christ of Christ, Apostolic, United Pentecostal, Anglican, and others.

<p>The unity that is desired by Moon's "We Will
Stand" venture goes far beyond a unity of professing Christians, though. Jenkins said that
the love of Jesus is so infinite that all should be embraced as children
of God. He cited Jesus' prayer in John 17 and applied it to
inter-denominational, inter-religious, and inter-racial unity. North American
Indians, who worship nature, Jews, Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam, and members
of other religions are involved in the Moon coalition.

<p>Like all ecumenical ventures, "We Will Stand"
encourages people to ignore error. Pastor Humphrey, who also spoke at the press
conference, said, "Love does not pay attention to things that are wrong." This
flies in the face of hundreds of biblical commands to judge all things by the
Word of God. Jude tells us to earnestly contend for the faith once delivered
to the saints (Jude 3). 2 Timothy tells preachers to reprove sin and error
(2 Tim. 4:2). The Psalmist, a man after God's own heart, said that he not
only loved the truth but hated every false way (Psalm 119:128).

<p>The 81-year-old Sun Myung Moon has been building broad
ecumenical coalitions for decades, and it is amazing to see men who profess to
believe the Bible joining hands with him. Moon was featured at an
"American Come Together" meeting in Washington, D.C., January 19, 2001. It was
advertised as "the inaugural prayer luncheon for unity and renewal" and
the chairpersons included four members of the U.S. House of Representatives
as well as Douglas Joo, President of the Washington Times Foundation,
which is owned by Moon. The "invitational committee and speakers"
included the following evangelical and charismatic leaders:

<p>Don Argue, President, Northwest College Pat Boone, CCM
singer Phil Driscole, CCM entertainer Kenneth Copeland, Word-Faith leader John
Corts, President, Billy Graham Evangelistic Association Paul Crouch,
President, Trinity Broadcasting Network Wiley Drake, Pastor, First Southern
Baptist Church, Buena Park, CA Tony Evans, Promise Keepers speaker Jerry
Falwell, President, Liberty University Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham Max
Lucado, popular author, Promise Keepers speaker James Merritt, President,
Southern Baptist Convention Thomas Trask, General Superintendent, Assemblies
of God.

<p>By joining this endeavor, these men were yoked together with
a wide variety of heresy, including cult leader Sun Myung Moon; Roman
Catholic John Michael Talbot, who prays to Mary; self-esteem guru Robert Schuller;
and Jewish Rabbi Daniel Lapin.

<p>Sun Myung Moon claims that Jesus Christ appeared to him in
1935 and commissioned him to establish the kingdom of God on earth.
He started the Unification Church in Korea in 1954, and in 1971 he came to
the United States. According to the strange Unification doctrine (the
"Divine Principle"), Moon and his wife, who are called
"the Heavenly Parents," were chosen to produce the kingdom of God on earth. Moon claims
that God said to him, "You are the son I have been seeking, the one who
can begin my eternal history." Supposedly, Adam and Eve failed to produce
the kingdom because of their sin, and Jesus likewise failed to produce the kingdom
of God because he was crucified before he could marry the perfect bride.
Thus Moon was chosen to carry on the work of Jesus Christ. Moon claims
that Jesus was born of an immoral relationship between Mary and the father of
John the Baptist. Moon conducts mass weddings of interracial couples. He says
that only when man and woman come together to procreate do they make a
whole human being. In Oakland, California, last month, he said to the women:
"If you don't give birth, you are disqualified as a woman" ("Rev.
Moon Stirs Up Fans," Oakland Tribune, March 13, 2001). In Oklahoma City, Moon proclaimed:
"I have been to the spirit world. I have met God." In Minneapolis, Moon
interrupted his message from time to time and asked, "Do you feel
grateful for Rev. Moon?" ("Rev. Moon still has much to say," Minneapolis
Star Tribune, March 11, 2001).
