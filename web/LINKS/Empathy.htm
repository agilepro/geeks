<b>People with a certain type of brain damage<br>showed less aversion to hurting others
<p>By Denise Gellene,<br>Times Staff Writer</b>
<p>Damage to the part of the brain that controls social emotions
changes the way people respond to thorny moral problems,
demonstrating the role of empathy and other feelings in
life-or-death decisions.
<p>Asked to resolve hypothetical dilemmas — such as tossing a person
from a bridge into the path of a trolley to save five others —
people with damage to their ventromedial prefrontal cortex tended to
sacrifice one life to save many, according to a study published
Wednesday by the journal <i>Nature</i>.
<p>People with intact brains were far less likely to kill or harm
someone when confronted with the same scenarios.
<p>The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, the
National Science Foundation and private sources, suggests that an
aversion to hurting others is hard-wired into the brain.
<p>"Part of our moral behavior is grounded … in a specific part of
our brains," said Dr. Antonio Damasio, one of the study's lead
authors and director of the Brain and Creativity Institute at USC.
<p>The findings could not be used to predict actual behavior,
Damasio said, because the scenarios presented in the study were
unrealistic. More research is needed to determine if people with and
without brain damage would react differently when faced with
real-world dilemmas.
<p>A finding linking a specific type of brain damage to day-to-day
moral behavior could have legal implications in criminal cases. But
researchers said the study was meant to explore the psychological
underpinnings of moral actions, not to characterize decisions as
right or wrong.
<p>The ventromedial prefrontal cortex processes feelings of empathy,
shame, compassion and guilt. Damage to this part of the brain, which
occupies a small region in the forehead, causes a diminished
capacity for social emotions but leaves logical reasoning intact.
<p>Researchers from USC, the University of Iowa, Harvard University
and Caltech posed 50 hypothetical scenarios to six people whose
ventromedial prefrontal cortices were damaged by strokes or tumors.
Their responses were compared to those given by 12 people without
brain damage and 12 others with damage in brain areas that regulate
other emotions, such as fear.
<p>Researchers found no difference among groups in their responses
to scenarios with no moral content, such as turning a tractor left
to harvest turnips.
<p>Scenarios that did not require participants to directly kill or
harm someone elicited very similar responses among the groups. For
example, people said they would classify personal expenses as
business expenses to lower their taxes.
<p>Additionally, members of all groups rejected decisions that would
harm someone for the personal benefit of another, such as killing a
newborn because a parent couldn't care for the infant.
<p>But people with damage to their ventromedial prefrontal cortex
were about three times as likely to sacrifice one person for the
greater good compared to people without brain damage or those with
damage in a different part of their brains.
<p>Joshua D. Greene, a Harvard psychologist not involved in the
research, said the study showed that moral judgment was shaped by
two brain systems — one focused on intuitive emotional responses and
another that controlled cognition.
<p>"When one of those systems is compromised, decisions are skewed,"
he said.
<p>Mirella Dapretto, associate professor of psychiatry at the UCLA
Ahmanson-Lovelace Brain Mapping Center, said the brain might not
work so simply.
<p>"One reason these people may have the guts to push someone off a
bridge is that they don't comprehend how their actions would be
evaluated by others," she said.<p><hr><h3 align=center>
