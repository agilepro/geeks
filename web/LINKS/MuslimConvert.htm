<p><h1>Top Muslim clerics: Convert must die</h1>
<h3>Religious leaders urge courts to ignore West, hang Christian</h3>
Friday, March 24, 2006<p>
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- Senior Muslim clerics are demanding that an Afghan
man on trial for converting from Islam to Christianity be executed, warning that
<strong>if the government caves in to Western pressure and frees him, they will
incite people to "pull him into pieces."</strong><p>
In an unusual move, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice telephoned
President Hamid Karzai on Thursday seeking a "favorable resolution" of the case
of Abdul Rahman. The 41-year-old former medical aid worker faces the death
penalty under Afghanistan's Islamic laws for becoming a Christian.<p>
His trial has fired passions in this conservative Muslim nation and highlighted
a conflict of values between Afghanistan and its Western backers.<p>
<strong>"Rejecting Islam is insulting God. We will not allow God to be
humiliated. This man must die," </strong>said cleric Abdul Raoulf, who is
considered a <em>moderate</em> and was jailed three times for opposing the
Taliban before the hard-line regime was ousted in 2001.<p>
"He is not crazy. He went in front of the media and confessed to being a
Christian," said Hamidullah, chief cleric at Haji Yacob Mosque. "The government
is scared of the international community. But the people will kill him if he is
freed."<p>
Raoulf, who is a member of the country's main Islamic organization, the Afghan
Ulama Council, concurred. "The government is playing games. The people will not
be fooled."<p>
<strong>"Cut off his head!"</strong> he exclaimed, sitting in a courtyard
outside Herati Mosque. "We will call on the people to pull him into pieces so
there's nothing left."<p>
He said the only way for Rahman to survive would be for him to go into exile.<p>
But Said Mirhossain Nasri, the top cleric at Hossainia Mosque, one of the
largest Shiite places of worship in Kabul, said Rahman must not be allowed to
leave the country.<p>
"If he is allowed to live in the West, then others will claim to be Christian so
they can, too," he said. "<strong>We must set an example. ... He must be
hanged."</strong><p>
The clerics said they were angry with the United States and other countries for
pushing for Rahman's freedom.<p>
"We are a small country and we welcome the help the outside world is giving us.
But please don't interfere in this issue," Nasri said. "<strong>We are Muslims
and these are our beliefs.</strong> This is much more important to us than all
the aid the world has given us."<p>
Afghanistan's constitution is based on Sharia law, which is interpreted by many
Muslims to require that any Muslim who rejects Islam be sentenced to death.
