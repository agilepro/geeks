You don't have to be a biologist or an anthropologist to see how closely
the great apes—gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos and orangutans—resemble
us. Even a child can see that their bodies are pretty much the same as
ours, apart from some exaggerated proportions and extra body hair. Apes
have dexterous hands much like ours but unlike those of any other
creature. And, most striking of all, their faces are uncannily
expressive, showing a range of emotions that are eerily familiar. That's
why we delight in seeing chimps wearing tuxedos, playing the drums or
riding bicycles. It's why a potbellied gorilla scratching itself in the
zoo reminds us of Uncle Ralph or Cousin Vinnie—and why, in a more
unsettled reaction, Queen Victoria, on seeing an orangutan named Jenny
at the London Zoo in 1842, declared the beast "frightful and painfully
and disagreeably human."
<p>It isn't just a superficial resemblance. Chimps, especially, not only
look like us, they also share with us some human-like behaviors. They
make and use tools and teach those skills to their offspring. They prey
on other animals and occasionally murder each other. They have complex
social hierarchies and some aspects of what anthropologists consider
culture. They can't form words, but they can learn to communicate via
sign language and symbols and to perform complex cognitive tasks.
Scientists figured out decades ago that chimps are our nearest
evolutionary cousins, roughly 98% to 99% identical to humans at the
genetic level. When it comes to DNA, a human is closer to a chimp than a
mouse is to a rat.
<p>Yet tiny differences, sprinkled throughout the genome, have made all
the difference. Agriculture, language, art, music, technology and
philosophy—all the achievements that make us profoundly different from
chimpanzees and make a chimp in a business suit seem so deeply
ridiculous—are somehow encoded within minute fractions of our genetic
code. Nobody yet knows precisely where they are or how they work, but
somewhere in the nuclei of our cells are handfuls of amino acids,
arranged in a specific order, that endow us with the brainpower to
outthink and outdo our closest relatives on the tree of life. They give
us the ability to speak and write and read, to compose symphonies, paint
masterpieces and delve into the molecular biology that makes us what we
are. <p>Until recently, there was no way to unravel these crucial
differences. Exactly what gives us advantages like complex brains and
the ability to walk upright—and certain disadvantages, including
susceptibility to a particular type of malaria, aids and Alzheimer's,
that don't seem to afflict chimps—remained a mystery.
<p>But that's rapidly changing. Just a year ago, geneticists announced
that they had sequenced a rough draft of the chimpanzee genome, allowing
the first side-by-side comparisons of human and chimpanzee DNA. Already,
that research has led to important discoveries about the development of
the human brain over the past few million years and possibly about our
ancestors' mating behavior as well.
<p>And sometime in the next few weeks, a team led by molecular
geneticist Svante Paabo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary
Anthropology, in Leipzig, Germany, will announce an even more stunning
achievement: the sequencing of a significant fraction of the genome of
Neanderthals—the human-like species we picture when we hear the word
caveman—who are far closer to us genetically than chimps are. And though
Neanderthals became extinct tens of thousands of years ago, Paabo is
convinced he's on the way to reconstructing the entire genome of that
long-lost relative, using DNA extracted, against all odds, from a
38,000-year-old bone.
<p>Laid side by side, these three sets of genetic blueprints—plus the
genomes of gorillas and other primates, which are already well on the
way to being completely sequenced—will not only begin to explain
precisely what makes us human but could lead to a better understanding
of human diseases and how to treat them.
<p><b>FIRST GLIMMERINGS</b>
<p>Scientists didn't need to wait for the chimp genome to begin
speculating about the essential differences between humans and apes, of
course. They didn't even need to know about DNA. Much of the vitriol
directed at Charles Darwin a century and a half ago came not from his
ideas about evolution in general but from his insulting but logical
implication that humans and the African apes are descended from a common
ancestor.
<p>As paleontologists have accumulated more and more fossils, they have
compiled data on a long list of anatomical features, including body
shape, bipedalism, brain size, the shape of the skull and face, the size
of canine teeth, and opposable thumbs. Using comparative analyses of
these attributes, along with dating that shows when various features
appeared or vanished, they have constructed increasingly elaborate
family trees that show the relationships between apes, ancient hominids
and us. Along the way they learned, among other things, that Darwin,
even with next to no actual data, was close to being right in his
intuition that apes and humans are descended from a single common
ancestor—and, surprisingly, that the ability to walk upright emerged
millions of years before the evolution of our big brains.
<p>But it wasn't until the 1960s that details of our physical
relationship to the apes started to be understood at the level of basic
biochemistry. Wayne State University scientist Morris Goodman showed,
for example, that injecting a chicken with a particular blood protein
from a human, a gorilla or a chimp provoked a specific immune response,
whereas proteins from orangutans and gibbons produced no response at
all. And by 1975, the then new science of molecular genetics had led to
a landmark paper by two University of California, Berkeley, scientists,
Mary-Claire King and Allan Wilson, estimating that chimps and humans
share between 98% and 99% of their genetic material.<p>
<b>ZEROING IN ON THE GENES</b>
<p>Even before the chimp genome was published, researchers had
begun teasing out our genetic differences. As long ago as 1998,
for example, glycobiologist Ajit Varki and colleagues at the
University of California, San Diego, reported that humans have
an altered form of a molecule called sialic acid on the surface
of their cells. This variant is coded for by a single gene,
which is damaged in humans. Since sialic acids act in part as a
docking site for many pathogens, like malaria and influenza,
this may explain why people are more susceptible to these
diseases than, say, chimpanzees are.
<p>A few years later, a team led by Paabo announced that the
human version of a gene called FOXP2, which plays a role in our
ability to develop speech and language, evolved within the past
200,000 years—after anatomically modern humans first appeared.
By comparing the protein coded by the human FOXP2 gene with the
same protein in various great apes and in mice, they discovered
that the amino-acid sequence that makes up the human variant
differs from that of the chimp in just two locations out of a
total of 715—an extraordinarily small change that may
nevertheless explain the emergence of all aspects of human
speech, from a baby's first words to a Robin Williams monologue.
And indeed, humans with a defective FOXP2 gene have trouble
articulating words and understanding grammar.
<p>Then, in 2004, a team led by Hansell Stedman of the
University of Pennsylvania identified a tiny mutation in a gene
on chromosome 7 that affects the production of myosin, the
protein that enables muscle tissue to contract. The mutant gene
prevents the expression of a myosin variant, known as MYH16, in
the jaw muscles used in biting and chewing. Since the same
mutation occurs in all of the modern human populations the
researchers tested—but not in seven species of nonhuman
primates, including chimps—the researchers suggest that lack of
MYH16 made it possible for our ancestors to evolve smaller jaw
muscles some 2 million years ago. That loss in muscle strength,
they say, allowed the braincase and brain to grow larger. It's a
controversial claim, one disputed by anthropologist C. Owen
Lovejoy of Kent State University. "Brains don't expand because
they were permitted to do so," he says. "They expand because
they were selected"—because they conferred extra reproductive
success on their owners, perhaps by allowing them to hunt more
effectively than the competition.
<p><b>BEYOND THE GENES</b>
<p>Still, the principle of gene-by-gene comparison remains a
powerful one, and just a year ago geneticists got hold of a
long-awaited tool for making those comparisons in bulk. Although
the news was largely overshadowed by the impact of Hurricane
Katrina, which hit the same week, the publication of a rough
draft of the chimp genome in the journal Nature immediately told
scientists several important things. First, they learned that
overall, the sequences of base pairs that make up both species'
genomes differ by 1.23%—a ringing confirmation of the 1970s
estimates—and that the most striking divergence between them
occurs, intriguingly, in the Y chromosome, present only in
males. And when they compared the two species' proteins—the
large molecules that cells construct according to blueprints
embedded in the genes—they found that 29% of the proteins were
identical (most of the proteins that aren't the same differ, on
average, by only two amino-acid substitutions).
<p>The genetic differences between chimps and humans, therefore,
must be relatively subtle. And they can't all be due simply to a
slightly different mix of genes. Even before the human genome
was sequenced back in 2000, says biologist Sean Carroll of the
University of Wisconsin, Madison, "it was estimated that humans
had 100,000 genes. When we got the genome, the estimate dropped
to 25,000. Now we know the overall number is about 22,000, and
it might even come down to 19,000."
<p>This shockingly small number made it clear to scientists that
genes alone don't dictate the differences between species; the
changes, they now know, also depend on molecular switches that
tell genes when and where to turn on and off. "Take the genes
involved in creating the hand, the penis and the vertebrae,"
says Lovejoy. "These share some of the same structural genes.
The pelvis is another example. Humans have a radically different
pelvis from that of apes. It's like having the blueprints for
two different brick houses. The bricks are the same, but the
results are very different."
<p>Those molecular switches lie in the noncoding regions of the
genome—once known dismissively as junk DNA but lately
rechristened the dark matter of the genome. Much of the genome's
dark matter is, in fact, junk—the residue of evolutionary events
long forgotten and no longer relevant. But a subset of the dark
matter known as functional noncoding DNA, comprising some 3% to
4% of the genome and mostly embedded within and around the
genes, is crucial. "Coding regions are much easier for us to
study," says Carroll, whose new book, The Making of the Fittest:
DNA and the Ultimate Forensic Record of Evolution, delves deep
into the issue. "But it may be the dark matter that governs a
lot of what we actually see."
<p>What causes changes in both the dark matter
and the genes themselves as one species evolves into another is
random mutation, in which individual base pairs—the "letters" of
the genetic alphabet—are flipped around like a typographical
error. These changes stem from errors that occur during sexual
reproduction, as DNA is copied and recombined. Sometimes long
strings of letters are duplicated, creating multiple copies in
the offspring. Sometimes they're deleted altogether or even
picked up, turned around and reinserted backward. A group led by
geneticist Stephen Scherer of the Hospital for Sick Children in
Toronto has identified 1,576 apparent inversions between the
chimp and human genomes; more than half occurred sometime during
human evolution.
<p>When an inversion, deletion or duplication occurs in an
unused portion of the genome, nothing much changes—and indeed,
the human, chimp and other genomes are full of such inert
stretches of DNA. When it happens in a gene or in a functional
noncoding stretch, by contrast, an inversion or a duplication is
often harmful. But sometimes, purely by chance, the change gives
the new organism some sort of advantage that enables it to
produce more offspring, thus perpetuating the change in another
generation.
<p><b>WHAT THE APES CAN TEACH US</b>
<p>A striking example of how gene duplication may have helped
propel us away from our apelike origins appeared in Science last
month. A research team led by James Sikela of the University of
Colorado at Denver and Health Sciences Center, in Aurora, Colo.,
looked at a gene that is believed to code for a piece of
protein, called DUF1220, found in areas of the brain associated
with higher cognitive function. The gene comes in multiple
copies in a wide range of primates—but, the scientists found,
humans carry the most copies. African great apes have
substantially fewer copies, and the number found in more distant
kin—orangutans and Old World monkeys—drops off even more.
<p>Another discovery, first published online by Nature two
months ago, describes a gene that appears to play a role in
human brain development. A team led by biostatistician Katherine
Pollard, now at the University of California, Davis, and Sofie
Salama, of U.C. Santa Cruz, used a sophisticated computer
program to search the genomes of humans, chimps and other
vertebrates for segments that have undergone changes at
substantially accelerated rates. They eventually homed in on 49
discrete areas they dubbed human accelerated regions, or HARs.
<p>The region that changed most dramatically from chimps to
humans, known as HAR1, turns out to be part of a gene that is
active in fetal brain tissue only between the seventh and 19th
weeks of gestation. Although the gene's precise function is
unknown, that happens to be the period when a protein called
reelin helps the human cerebral cortex develop its
characteristic six-layer structure. What makes the team's
research especially intriguing is that all but two of the HARs
lie in those enigmatic functional noncoding regions of the
genome, supporting the idea that much of the difference between
species happens there.
<p><b>SEX WITH CHIMPS?</b>
<p>Comparisons of primate genomes have also led to an
astonishing, controversial and somewhat disquieting assertion
about the origin of humanity. Along with several colleagues,
David Reich of the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass., compared
DNA from chimpanzees and humans with genetic material from
gorillas, orangutans and macaques. Scientists have long used the
average difference between genomes as a sort of evolutionary
clock because more closely related species have had less time to
evolve in different directions. Reich's team measured how the
evolutionary clock varied across chromosomes in the different
species. To their surprise, they deduced that chimps and humans
split from a common ancestor no more than 6.3 million years ago
and probably less than 5.4 million years ago. If they're
correct, several hominid species now considered to be among our
earliest ancestors—Sahelanthropus tchadensis (7 million years
old), Orrorin tugenensis (about 6 million years old) and
Ardipithecus kadabba (5.2 to 5.7 million years old)—may have to
be re-evaluated.
<p>And that's not the most startling finding. Reich's team also
found that the entire human X chromosome diverged from the
chimp's X chromosome about 1.2 million years later than the
other chromosomes. One plausible explanation is that chimps and
humans first split but later interbred from time to time before
finally going their separate evolutionary ways. That could
explain why some of the most ancient fossils now considered
human ancestors have such striking mixtures of chimp and human
traits—some could actually have been hybrids. Or they might have
simply coexisted with, or even predated, the last common
ancestor of chimps and humans.
<p>All of that depends in part on the accuracy of fossil dating
and the reliability of using genetic variation as a clock. Both
methods currently carry big margins of error. But the more
primate genomes that geneticists can lay side by side, the more
questions they will be able to answer. "We have rough sequences
for humans, orangutans, chimps, macaques," says Eric Lander,
director of the Broad Institute and a leader of the research
team that decoded the chimpanzee genome. "But we don't have the
entire gorilla genome yet. Lemurs are coming along, and so are
gibbons." <p><b>DECODING NEANDERTHALS</b>
<p>Also coming along, thanks to two independent teams of
researchers, is the genome of the closest relative of all: the
Neanderthal. Ancestors of Neanderthals first appeared some
500,000 years ago, and for a long time it was a toss-up whether
that lineage would outlive our own species, at least in Europe
and western Asia—or whether, bizarre as it seems today, they
would both survive indefinitely. The Neanderthals held out for
hundreds of thousands of years. A discovery published online by
Nature last month suggests Neanderthals may have made their last
stand in Gibraltar, on the southern tip of the Iberian
Peninsula, surviving until about 28,000 years ago—and possibly
even longer.
<p>The Neanderthals weren't nearly as primitive as many assume,
observes Eddy Rubin, director of the Department of Energy's
Joint Genome Institute in Walnut Creek, Calif. "They had fire,
burial ceremonies, the rudiments of what we would call art. They
were advanced—but nothing like what humans have done in the last
10,000 to 15,000 years." We eventually outcompeted them, and the
key to how we did so may well lie in our genes. So two years
ago, Svante Paabo, the man who deconstructed the FOXP2 language
gene and has done considerable research on ancient DNA, launched
an effort to re-create the Neanderthal genome. Rubin, meanwhile,
is tackling the same task using a different technique.
<p>The job isn't an easy one. Like any complex organic molecule,
DNA degrades over time, and bones that lie in the ground for
thousands of years become badly contaminated with the DNA of
bacteria and fungi. Anyone who handles the fossils can also
leave human DNA behind. After probing the remains of about 60
different Neanderthals out of the 400 or so known, Paabo and his
team found only two with viable material. Moreover, he
estimates, only about 6% of the genetic material his team
extracts from the bones turns out to be Neanderthal DNA.
<p>As a result, progress is maddeningly slow.
And while he can't reveal details, Paabo says he'll soon be
announcing in a major scientific journal the sequencing of 1
million base pairs of the Neanderthal genome. And he says he has
4 million more in the bag. Rubin, meanwhile, is also poised to
publish his results, but refuses to divulge specifics. "Paabo's
team has significantly more of a sequence than we do," he says.
"Some of the dates will differ, but the conclusions are largely
similar."
<p>Although Paabo admits that he still hasn't learned much about
what distinguishes us from our closest cousins, simply showing
he can reconstruct significant DNA sequences from such long-dead
creatures is an important proof of concept. Both he and Rubin
agree that within a couple of years a reasonably complete
Neanderthal genome should be available. "It will tell us about
aspects of biology, like soft tissue, that we can't say anything
about right now," Rubin notes. "It could tell us about disease
susceptibility and immunity. And in places where the sequence
overlaps that of humans, it will enable us to compare a
prehistoric creature with chimps." Someday it may even be
possible to insert equivalent segments of human and Neanderthal
DNA into different laboratory mice in order to see what effects
they produce.
<p><b>WHAT IT ALL MEANS</b>
<p>Precisely how useful this information will be is hard to
assess. Indeed, a few experts are dismissive of the whole
project. "I'm not sure what Neanderthals will tell us," says
Kent State's Lovejoy. "They're real late [in terms of human
evolution]. And they represent, at best, a little environmental
isolate in Europe. I can't imagine we're going to learn much
about human evolution by studying them." Lovejoy is even more
dismissive about claims that ancestors of chimps and humans
interbred, arguing that using mutation rates in the genome to
time evolutionary changes is extraordinarily imprecise.
<p>In fact, even the most ardent proponents of genome-comparison
research acknowledge that pretty much everything we know so far
is preliminary. "We're interested in traits that really distance
us from other organisms," says Wisconsin's Carroll, "such as
susceptibility to diseases, big brains, speech, walking upright,
opposable thumbs. Based on the biology of other organisms, we
have to believe that those are very complex traits. The
development of form, the increase in brain size, took place over
a long period of time, maybe 50,000 generations. It's a pretty
complicated genetic recipe."
<p>But even the toughest critics acknowledge that these studies
have enormous potential. "We will eventually be able to pinpoint
every difference between every animal on the planet," says
Lovejoy. "And every time you throw another genome, like the
gorilla's, into the mix, you increase the chances even more."
<p>Some of the differences could have enormous practical
consequences. Since his discovery that human cells lack one
specific form of sialic acid, which was accomplished even before
the human genome was decoded, Varki and his collaborators have
determined that 10 of the 60 or so genes that govern sialic-acid
biology show major differences between chimps and humans. "And
in every case," says Varki, "it's humans who are the odd one
out." Such revelations could probably lead to a better
understanding of such devastating diseases as malaria, aids and
viral hepatitis—and likely do so faster than by studying the
human genome alone.
<p>For most of us, though, it's the grand question about what it
is that makes us human that renders comparative genome studies
so compelling. As scientists keep reminding us, evolution is a
random process in which haphazard genetic changes interact with
random environmental conditions to produce an organism somehow
fitter than its fellows. After 3.5 billion years of such
randomness, a creature emerged that could ponder its own
origins—and revel in a Mozart adagio. Within a few short years,
we may finally understand precisely when and how that happened.?</td>
