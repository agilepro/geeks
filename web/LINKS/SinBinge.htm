<h1>Papal Election Brings End to Worldwide<br>
Unsupervised-Catholic Sin Binge</h1>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 15px">VATICAN CITYâ€”In the interim between Pope John
Paul II's death and the election of his replacement, unsupervised Catholics
seized the opportunity to sin without fear of reprisal, sources confirmed
Tuesday.</p>

<p>"For two weeks, it was like Mardi Gras all over again," said Bryan
Cousivert, a Catholic from Arizona. "People were drinking, cursing, and
engaging in premarital or even extramarital sex. More importantly, everyone was
being totally open about it. No one was worried about doing any penance at all!"
<p>Continued Cousivert: "When the cat's away, the mice will play."
<p>Paulo Verrazetti, a resident of Rome, said he and other Italians respectfully
refrained from reveling until after Pope John Paul II's funeral.
<p>"We all mourned John Paul II's death," said Verrazetti, who was at
St. Peter's Square for the former pope's funeral. "But when Vatican
officials said that final 'Amen,' you could feel something change in the air.
Someone screamed '<i>festa!</i>' and pretty soon Catholic women were going wild,
running topless in the streets. Last month, seeing a woman with no clothes on
would have sent me straight to the confessional. But without a pope around,
well... Let's put it this way. For a couple weeks, Catholics the world over
adopted the motto, 'If it feels good, do it.'"
<p>Even those who only watched Pope John Paul II's funeral on television
reported experiencing "feelings of newfound freedom."
<p>"As they recited the Apostles' Creed, I remember thinking of all the
things I want to do, but don't because of my devotion to the Church," said
Antonio Valez, a Catholic from Mexico City. "As soon as I heard the pope
was laid to rest, I said a prayer for the Holy Father's departed soul and went
straight out and bought a box of condoms. Actually, I'm wearing one right now.
It's been on all day and I'm loving it."
<p>Carl Whitestone, an 82-year-old lifelong Catholic from Beaver Dam, WI said he
experienced a similar sense of freedom.
<p>"When I heard the pope was dead, the first thing I thought about,
besides how much the great man will be missed, was the big bloody steak I was
going to eat on Friday," said Whitestone. "When the pope was alive, I
never would've thought of flouting the 1917 Pio-Benedictine Code Of Canon Law.
But once he was out of the picture, I immediately bore false witness against my
neighbor. And then I coveted his wife."</p>

<p>Many Catholics said they started out cautiously, limiting their misconduct to
non-mortal sins: taking the Lord's name in vain, failing to contemplate the
mysteries of the rosary, or sleeping in on Sunday morning instead of going to
Mass. But when they saw no immediate consequences for their behavior, their sins
became progressively more severe.
<p>While church officials were reluctant to comment on how many recent murders
might be attributable to the papal lapse, several cardinals said they were
relieved when the papal conclave commenced.
<p>"It was really getting out of control," said Cardinal Joseph
Ratzinger, the prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.
"The pope is the gatekeeper between piety and anarchy. Without a papal
presence, Catholics were thinking impure thoughts, manipulating their own
genitals, and acting as if homosexuality was no big deal. Thank goodness we
gathered to choose the new pope, or God's Kingdom on Earth might look like Sodom
and Gomorrah by now."
<p>Papal scholars said the recent bacchanalia was the worst in more than a
quarter of a century.
<p>"I haven't seen anything like this since Pope Paul VI died in
1978," said Fr. Robert Mendiga, a Jesuit priest at St. Andrew's School of
Divinity in North Carolina. "This was the '70s, the era of pre-AIDS sexual
experimentation and widespread recreational-drug use. Catholics, especially
Americans, were quite willing to be led into temptation. It stopped when John
Paul I was chosen, but when he died one month later, Catholics went right back
to sinning."
<p>"Yup," the priest added, gazing into the distance. "1978 was a
very special year."
