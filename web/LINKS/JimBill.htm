Recently the wife of Hawaii's governor, Vicky Cayetano accepted a
"Distinguished Citizen of the Year" award from the Aloha Council of the Boy
Scouts.&nbsp; Later she wrote a letter to the Honolulu newspapers saying that she
wished that the Boy Scouts were inclusive.<p>
There was a letter to the editor of the Honolulu Advertiser saying that
Vicky Cayetano should have refused the award.&nbsp; Then there was a letter from
someone, defending Boy Scout discrimination against gays and atheists, and
saying that we should support the Boy Scout's "Freedom of Choice."<p>
Friday (8/9/02) the Honolulu Advertiser printed my letter to the editor, which follows:
<p><hr><p>
<b>Award should be taken when group is inclusive</b><p>
I would have preferred that Vicky Cayetano did not accept an award from
the Boy Scouts.<p>
There is no question that the Boy Scouts of America officially, openly
and explicitly discriminates against gays and atheists.<p>
It will not allow a man known to be gay or an atheist to be a
scoutmaster, and it does not permit gay or atheist boys to be members.<p>
The Boy Scouts discriminates against children, as well as adults. This
discrimination has been held by the highest court in the land to be legal.<p>
The Boy Scouts has been strongly criticized for its discrimination and
it will continue to be strongly criticized, as long as it continues to
discriminate, by those who support tolerance, inclusiveness and fair
treatment of all.<p>
The Boy Scouts wants to keep its tax-exempt status, which amounts to a
subsidy by all taxpayers, and it would like to continue using the facilities
of our governments and other groups, many of which have policies against
discrimination on the basis of religion and/or sexual orientation.<p>
It also wants to recruit in our schools, many of which have
nondiscrimination policies regarding sexual orientation and/or religion. I
see conflicts and problems.<p>
It should be noted that other groups that serve young people, such as
the Girl Scouts, Big Brothers/Big Sisters, Boys &amp; Girls Clubs and other
organizations, do not see the need to discriminate in the same way as the
Boy Scouts. It just shows that the Boy Scouts are backward and behind the
times.<p>
I really appreciate Cayetano's statement that she would like the Boy
Scouts to be inclusive. It would have been better if she had passed on her
award until the Boy Scouts are actually inclusive.<p>
