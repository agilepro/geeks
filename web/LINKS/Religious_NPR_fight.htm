  The Rev. Don Wildmon, founding chairman of a mushrooming network of
  Christian radio stations, does not like National Public Radio.<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>"He detests the news that the public gets through NPR and believes
  it is slanted from a distinctly liberal and secular perspective," said
  Patrick Vaughn, general counsel for Mr. Wildmon's American Family Radio.<o:p></o:p></p>
<!--Middle ad type : bigad -->
  <p>Here in Lake Charles, American Family Radio has silenced what its boss
  detests. <o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>It knocked two NPR affiliate stations off the local airwaves last year, transforming
  this southwest Louisiana community of 95,000 people into the most populous
  place in the country where "All Things Considered" cannot be
  heard.<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>In place of that program — and "Morning Edition," "Car
  Talk" and a local Cajun program called "Bonjour Louisiana" —
  listeners now find "Home School Heartbeat," "The Phyllis
  Schlafly Report" and the conservative evangelical musings of Mr.
  Wildmon, whose network broadcasts from Tupelo, Miss.<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>The Christian stations routed NPR in Lake Charles under a federal law
  that allows noncommercial broadcasters with licenses for full-power
  stations to push out those with weaker signals — the equivalent of the
  varsity team kicking the freshmen out of the gym.<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>This is happening all over the country. The losers are so-called
  translator stations, low-budget operations that retransmit the signals of
  bigger, distant stations. The Federal Communications Commission considers
  them squatters on the far left side of the FM dial, and anyone who is
  granted a full-power license can legally run them out of town. <o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>Religious broadcasters have done this to public radio stations in Oregon
  and Indiana, too, and many large-market public radio stations, like WBEZ in
  Chicago, complain that new noncommercial stations, most of them religious,
  are stepping on the signal at the edge of their transmission areas.<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>Stations are scrambling for these frequencies at a time of rapid growth
  in the national NPR audience and even faster growth in religious networks
  like American Family Radio. It owns 194 stations, has 18 affiliates and has
  applications for hundreds more pending with the F.C.C.<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>"The noncommercial band is getting very, very crowded, and there
  just is not a lot of room for new stations in desirable areas," said
  Robert Unmacht, a Nashville-based radio consultant. "The competition
  is fierce, and the Reverend Wildmon is especially hard-nosed. His people
  are very good at what they do."<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>Public radio is belatedly fighting back. Last year, a national nonprofit
  organization was set up to fend off the new hardball competition. Called
  Public Radio Capital, it raises money through tax-exempt bonds to help
  local public stations end their reliance on translators and buy full-power
  stations.<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>Public Radio Capital, created with seed money from the Corporation for Public
  Broadcasting, a federally financed agency, has since helped public radio
  stations in Chicago, Denver, Nashville and Tacoma, Wash., to outbid their
  competition.<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>In Tacoma, the organization bought a noncommercial FM station from a
  local technical college for $5 million. Money to operate the station will
  come from major public stations in the area.<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>"Until recently, public radio had been completely dependent on
  local initiative to protect its signal and acquire new stations," said
  Marc Hand, the managing director of Public Radio Capital, which is based in
  Denver. "A lot of times, local radio is not aware of how to compete.
  We are stepping in when we can to help."<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>For many of NPR's 273 member organizations, the legal and administrative
  costs of competing against religious broadcasters are sponging up millions
  of dollars that they might otherwise spend on news and other local
  programming. <o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>"It is, like, nuts," said Torey Malatia, general manager of
  WBEZ, which has the country's third-largest public-radio audience.
  "Starting about four years ago we realized that if we didn't learn how
  to fight back, our coverage area would effectively shrink by a million
  people."<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>As NPR itself acknowledges, religious broadcasters are often far better
  prepared for the radio wars. "They have employed a long-term strategy,
  where we have failed to do that," said Dana Davis Rehm, vice president
  for member and program services at NPR in Washington.<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>The two public radio stations heard in Lake Charles, for example, were
  caught napping as American Family Radio maneuvered over several years to
  bump them off the air. <o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>Those college-based public stations, one in nearby Lafayette, La., and
  the other just across the Louisiana border in Beaumont, Tex., could have
  applied for F.C.C. licenses granting them the right to build and operate
  full-power stations in Lake Charles. Instead, like many public radio
  stations, they chose to operate on the cheap, using translators.<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>Translator-based stations have given American Family Radio the opening
  it needs to grab space on the noncommercial FM dial between 88.1 and 91.9
  megahertz.<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>As early as 1997, the network filed applications with the F.C.C.,
  declaring its intention to build two full-powered stations that would step
  on the two translator-based public radio signals in Lake Charles. But KRVS
  in Lafayette and KVLU in Beaumont did not react and apply for full-power
  stations of their own.<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>"NPR people should really be embarrassed," said Mr. Vaughn,
  the lawyer for American Family Radio. "They knew for years that we had
  applied, and they didn't do anything about it. NPR people were drawing
  money out of the community in the form of pledge support, but they didn't
  bother to apply for a full-power station. It is not our fault."<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>Religious broadcasters are snapping up most noncommercial stations when
  they come on the market. In the first two quarters of 2002, there were 14
  sales of noncommercial stations. Of those, public radio groups bought only
  two.<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>Competition between religious and public radio stations is not always
  acrimonious. Competitors have amicably divided a contested frequency in
  some cases by agreeing to use directional antennas that limit interference.
  Here in Lake Charles, local rage at the loss of all access to NPR has
  fueled a yearlong effort to bring back public radio.<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>"What Wildmon has done to the public broadcasting band is try to
  eat it all," said Robert W. McGill, 74, an NPR devotee and a retired
  chemist. <o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>Mr. Wildmon, who became well known in the 1970's when he led national
  campaigns against sex and violence on television, declined to be
  interviewed. <o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>Mr. Vaughn, the general counsel for American Family Radio, acknowledged
  that the network was aware that its two new stations would be
  "blocking out" public radio in Lake Charles. But, he added,
  "We were in no way targeting it."<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>Like many religious networks, American Family Radio has little local
  content; its stations rely instead on satellite feeds from the home office
  in Tupelo. Radio industry analysts agree that public stations usually carry
  more local news and offer programs more closely tied to the communities
  they serve. <o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>More than a year after American Family Radio went on the air here, its
  two stations (one carries what it calls Christian contemporary programming,
  the other what it calls traditional gospel) have just one local employee.
  Elizabeth Arrington, 21, the station manager, works in a remodeled house on
  the edge of town. Its broadcast studio is an empty room, although Mrs.
  Arrington said radio equipment would arrive soon. <o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>In all likelihood, before American Family Radio gets around to local
  broadcasts in Lake Charles, public radio will be back on the air here.<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>A $309,000 antenna, nearing completion about 30 miles west of town, will
  let people here pick up KRVS, the NPR affiliate in Lafayette. <o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>Sixty percent of the money for the antenna came from a Commerce
  Department grant. The rest came from the city and parish governments, as
  well as from private local contributions. The primary local mover in
  raising money was Carolyn Woosley, a financial planner and playwright. <o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>"We lost access to a treasure that we all pay for with our tax
  dollars, and we got mad," Ms. Woosley said. "We decided you don't
  have to like NPR in this town, but you are going to have to make room for
  it."<o:p></o:p></p>
