<h2>"Frog-amander" Fossil May Be Amphibian Missing Link</h2>

A new fossil find may be an evolutionary missing link in the
<a href="http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/amphibians.html">amphibian</a> family tree, scientists say.
<p>The 290-million-year-old fossil was first
collected in Texas by a paleontologist with
the Smithsonian Institution in the
mid-1990s. It was rediscovered in the
collections of the National Museum of
Natural History in Washington, D.C., in 2004.<p>

<p>"It had an overall amphibian gestalt. … You
know, kind of a froggy slamander-y sort of
look," said Jason Anderson, a comparative
biologist at the University of Calgary,
Canada, who led a new analysis of the fossil.
<p>"But also I recognized some of the
archaic features too, and I thought that
this would be a critical piece of evidence
in trying to work out the origins of modern
amphibians."
<p>Dubbed <i>Gerobatrachus hottoni,</i> the
animal looked somewhat like a salamander
with a stubby tail and froglike ears.
<p>"So it's kind of a frogamander, if you
will," said Anderson.
<p><h3>Filling in Fossil Gap</h3>
<i>Gerobatrachus</i> fits into a noted
gap in the fossil record of
amphibians—between one of the groups
hypothesized to be ancestors of modern
amphibians, called temnospondyls, and the
earliest frogs and salamanders.

<p>"It pretty convincingly settles the
question [that the] frog and salamander
shared origins from the same fossil group,"
Anderson said.
<p>John Bolt, curator for fossil amphibians
and reptiles at The Field Museum in Chicago
Illinois, who was not involved in the study,
said, "The most astonishing thing to me
about this study is that this animal is far
more froglike than I would ever have
expected from its age."
<p>"Nothing this nonprimitive has ever been
described from this age. It's just amazing."
<p>Until recently it was believed that frogs,
salamanders, and caecilians—long wormlike
amphibians—all shared a common ancestor.

<p>The rediscovered fossil suggests that
frogs and salamanders branched out from one
set of ancestors while caecilians descended
from another.
<p>The creature's combination of frog- and
salamander-like features further supports
earlier studies suggesting that frogs and
salamanders are more closely related to each
other than to caecilians.
<p>"This animal seems to show that frogs and
salamanders are more closely related to each
other than either are to these elongate
caecilians," said Robert Carroll, a
paleontologist at McGill University in
Montreal, Canada, who was not involved in
this study.
<p>Carroll noted that some of <i>
Gerobatrachus'</i>s features crop up in
older fossils, suggesting that the animal
may be descended from an ancestral group
that branched out into frogs and salamanders
at an earlier point.
<p>"I would say <i>Gerobatrachus</i> was a
relic at least in relationship to the
question of the ancestry and point of
division between frogs and salamanders,"
Carroll said.
<p>Bolt, the Field Museum expert, cautioned
that it is difficult to say for sure whether
this creature was itself a common ancestor
of the two modern groups, given that there
is only one known specimen of <i>Gerobatrachus</i>, and an incomplete one at
that.
<p>"At this point I would say it is by no
means certain that this is representative of
a common ancestor to frogs and salamanders,
although it might be," Bolt said.
<p>"The fact that something this remarkably
like the modern amphibians is present
[during this period] suggests that, really,
you could have had an even earlier example
of something that was ancestral to modern
frogs and salamanders."
