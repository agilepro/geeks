American Clergy Leadership Conference<br>
Regarding the "Cloud of Witnesses" Ad of the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification International</b>
<p>The American Clergy Leadership Conference is a broad-based interdenominational and interracial
coalition of ministers with a singular threefold purpose: to rebuild the
family, restore the community and renew the nation and the world. The Mission
Statement of the ACLC is very emphatic as to where it stands and the areas of
agreement necessary for inclusion and participation in its organization:</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal" style="COLOR: black; LINE-HEIGHT: 140%; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt:
auto; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">To
unify the body of Christ (the Christian churches).
<li>To foster denominational unity and to share the love of Christ.
<li>To dissolve racial barriers by practicing the principle of loving one's enemies.
<li>To provide moral direction for America and its leaders.
<li>To promote the blessing of marriage and the end of divorce as well as
strengthening family ties and cultivating a healthy environment for youth
in the family and the community.
<li>To bring salvation through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
<li>To actively participate in the renewal of the community by working together
with people of faith and other organizations to address the needs of the people.
<li>To acknowledge and invite the Holy Spirit to work and then inspire and direct
the people of the nation.
<li>To work for an environment of living for the sake of others.</span><p>
</ul>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 140%"><span style="COLOR: black">While the ACLC
welcomes the involvement and participation of spiritual leaders of a variety
of religious convictions in its work and activities, it neither embraces nor
supports their doctrine, polity or discipline. The ACLC firmly believes that
it can interact and interface with world religions without asking a minister
to compromise his/her denominational beliefs or stance with one's church,
mosque, temple or synagogue.
<p>The ACLC affirms the right of every religion to state and promote its teachings, convictions and
doctrine in the manner, form and forum it deems appropriate and necessary.
Therefore, the ACLC takes no position, makes no comment and renders no
judgment on the recent publication of an advertisement of the Family
Federation for World Peace and Unification/Unification Church entitled "Cloud of Witnesses."
<p>The ACLC believes that it can demonstrate a profound respect for the spiritual leader of the
Unification Church, the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, while being true to the ACLC
position that remains open and respectful of all faiths and peoples.
<p>Approved by the National Executive Committee, July 30, 2002<p>

<h3>I guess that once people believe in imaginary super-beings, they can
respect anything, including saying that all these people came back to make
statements: Jesus, Peter, Paul, John Calvin, Martin Luther, John Wesley, St.
Augustine, Confucius, Muhammad, Karl Marx, Lenin, Stalin, and Deng Xiao Ping.
Heck, even GOD had a letter to the Beloved True Parents! I would love to see
the actual letter in His handwriting.<p>
The ACLC is basically saying, "Rev. Moon has his realm and we have
ours, so let's not interfere with each other or confuse people by saying
anything negative."</h3>
