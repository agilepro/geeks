<p>SAN FRANCISCO–For as long as he can remember, 7-year-old Timmy Yu
has had one precious dream: From the bottom of his heart, he has
hoped against hope that God would someday hear his prayer to walk
again. Though many thought Timmy's heavenly plea would never be
answered, his dream finally came true Monday, when the Lord
personally responded to the wheelchair-bound boy's prayer with a
resounding no.<p>

<p>"I knew that if I just prayed hard enough, God would hear me,"
said the joyful Timmy, surrounded by stuffed animals sent by
well-wishing Christians from around the globe, as he sat in the
wheelchair to which he will be confined for the rest of his life.
"And now my prayer has been answered. I haven't been this happy
since before the accident, when I could walk and play with the other
children like a normal boy."
<p>God's response came at approximately 10 a.m. Monday, following a
particularly fervent Sunday prayer session by little Timmy.
Witnesses said God issued His miraculous answer in the form of a
towering column of clouds, from which poured forth great beams of
Divine light and the music of the Heavenly Hosts. The miraculous
event took place in the Children's Special Care Ward of St. Luke's
Hospital, where Timmy goes three times a week for an excruciating
two-hour procedure to drain excess fluid from his damaged spinal
column.
<p>Said Angela Schlosser, a day nurse who witnessed the Divine
Manifestation: "An incredible, booming voice said to Timmy, 'I am
the Lord thy God, who created the rivers and the mountains, the
heavens and the earth, the sun and the moon and the stars. Before Me
sits My beloved child, whose faith is that of the mustard seed from
which grows mighty and powerful things. My child, Timmy Yu, I say
unto you thus: I have heard your prayers, and now I shall answer
them. No, you cannot get out of your wheelchair. Not ever."
<p>Paralyzed in a 1996 auto accident that also claimed the lives of
both his parents, Timmy has served as a shining example to his
fellow churchgoers at Lord In Heaven On High Church, inspiring
others with his simple, heartfelt devotion. Now that Timmy has
received an answer, Christians the world over are celebrating his
story as a stirring testament to the power of faith.
<p>"The Lord has answered a little boy's plea to know if he would
ever walk again, and that answer was no," Rev. H. Newman Gunther of
the San Francisco School Of Divinity said. "For years, this boy had
been plagued by the question of whether or not he would ever walk,
and now Our Lord, in his wisdom and mercy, has forever laid to rest
any lingering doubt. Young Timmy can rest assured in the immutable
truth that the Lord has bestowed upon him. Now and for all time, he
finally knows that he will never escape the cruel prison of his
chair of iron, for God hath willed it so. Praise be to God!"

<p>Asked for comment, God said: "This kind-hearted child's simple
prayer hath moved Me. Never before have I seen such faith. His
trusting soul, so full of innocent devotion to Me, hath offered
seventy times seven prayers asking, 'God? Can I please walk again?'
It was indeed right and fitting that I, in My infinite wisdom,
should share with him the One True Answer to this long-repeated
question he put before Me."
<p>"My will be done," God added.
<p>Witnesses to the miracle said Timmy begged God for several
minutes to change His mind and heal his shattered vertebrae, but the
Lord stood firm.
<p>"God strongly suggested that Timmy consider praying to one of the
other intercessionary agents of Divine power, like Jesus, Mary or
maybe even a top saint," Timmy's personal physician, Dr. William
Luttrell, said. "The Lord stressed to Timmy that it was a long shot,
but He said he might have better luck with one of them."
<p>Despite all the attention he has received, Timmy remains humble
in the face of his newfound notoriety as the only human ever to have
a prayer directly answered by God Himself.
<p>"I know that God loves me, because it says so in the Bible,"
Timmy said. "So right now, I am just glad that God took the time to
answer my prayer. If only I could walk, this would be the greatest
day of my life."<p><hr><h3 align=center>&raquo; <a href=Humor.html>go to Atheists of Silicon Valley Humor Page</a> &laquo;<p>
