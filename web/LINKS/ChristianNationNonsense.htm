<h1 align=center>Christian Nation Nonsense on the 4th of July</h1>
by Jonathan Rowe, July 4th, 2008

<p>You can always count on WorldNetDaily to give us such. This year <a
href="http://wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=68674">one Tom Flannery
writes</a> an article ridiculed with factual errors and unsound historical
claims. Some highlights with my commentary:
<blockquote>
<p>On July 2, 1776, John Adams wrote
two letters to his wife, Abigail, about the historic events surrounding the
forthcoming Declaration of Independence. In one of those letters, he predicted
that future generations might celebrate the day – the Fourth of July…to mark
the birth of America. Adams pondered that possibility and determined this would
be appropriate only if it was observed as a day of deliverance with solemn acts
of devotion to God.

<p>Adams understood that, without the
God of the Bible intervening on her behalf, there would be no America. From the
founding of our nation, to our break with England, to the framing of our
Constitution and enacting of our laws, he and most of our other founders
recognized that Providence (the will and work of Almighty God) was supremely
evident throughout.
</blockquote>

<p>First, it’s not at all clear that
Adams believed in the Christian God/God of the Bible. Adams was <a
href="http://www.positiveliberty.com/2006/04/john-adams-quotation-of-the-week-2.html">a
fervent theological unitarian</a>
(denier of the Trinity) who believed the Bible to be <a
href="http://americancreation.blogspot.com/2008/06/jeffersons-syncretism-adams-belief-in.html">only
a partially inspired book</a>, and that <a
href="http://www.positiveliberty.com/2007/07/john-adams-vindicated.html">all
sorts of exotic religions, notably Hindus</a>, worshipped the same God he did. John Adams is not a good
spokesman for the “Christian America” claim.

<p>Next, Flannery’s article discusses
Christopher Columbus and then the Pilgrims as though they had anything to do
with what when down in America from 1776-1800; <a
href="http://www.positiveliberty.com/2008/03/distinguish-between-americas-founding-planting.html">they didn’t</a>. 

<p>Flannery’s article continues:
<blockquote>
<p>In 1776, Adams and our other
Founding Fathers fought the tyrannical King George with the rallying cry of “No
king but King Jesus!” The aforementioned Declaration of Independence they
signed to break from Britain contains four separate references to God and
acknowledges that our inalienable human rights come from Him. It also delineates
a litany of King George’s biblical violations, which they based that break upon.
</blockquote>

<p>My research shows that some American
Christians did rally to the cry of “No King but Jesus,” but not John Adams.
From what I’ve seen, this phrase is nowhere in Adams’ historical writings.
Adams did consider himself a follower of Jesus, but was also, as noted, a
fervent theological unitarian who utterly rejected Jesus’ Godhood or second place in the Trinity.

<p>Regarding King George’s supposed
“biblical violations,” notice that the Declaration of Independence doesn’t
define them as such. You can always go back, after the fact, and read
“biblical” content into any text, for instance, if you look hard enough you can
probably find the “biblical content” in a warranty for a microwave. And that’s
exactly what folks do when they claim America’s Declaration describes King
George’s “biblical violations.”

<p>Flannery’s article continues:

<blockquote>
<p>Then came the Revolutionary War. Time and again during the war, it looked like the
“Glorious Cause of America” was about to be extinguished. Yet in virtually
every instance, as detailed in David McCullough’s wonderful book “1776,” there
was some wholly unnatural occurrence (a fateful turn of the weather, an
inexplicable delay or miscalculation by the enemy at a crucial juncture, etc.)
that saved the day – and the revolution. In each case, George Washington and the
founders were quick to describe these truly extraordinary events as
“miraculous” and ascribe them to Providence, then give God the glory for them.
</blockquote>

<p>God may indeed have helped to
“found” America but it is not at all apparent according to tradition biblical
Christian theology why Christians should believe this. Don’t forget America
rebelled against another nation of Christians who arguably had a stronger, more
traditional biblical case on their behalf (see Romans 13). The very act of
revolting against government was arguably a far more “biblical violation” than
anything King George did!

<p>More from Flannery:
<blockquote>
<p>When God gave the ragtag
revolutionaries a stunning victory over the greatest army on earth, our
founders set about forging a new nation. Washington and Alexander Hamilton said
they based the idea for America’s separation of powers upon the Bible verse Jeremiah 17:9, which teaches that the
human heart is “deceitful above all things and desperately wicked.” The
founders also based our three branches of government on Isaiah 33:22; tax
exemption for churches on Ezra 7:24; Article 4 of our Constitution on Exodus
18:21-22; and so on.
</blockquote>

<p>This is an ought right lie. Though, as noted, you can try to connect, after the fact, the Bible
to ideas in any text, Washington and Hamilton never said they based any texts
of the Constitution on the Bible. I know this is a harsh accusation; but if I’m
shown wrong, I’ll gladly concede. I challenge Mr. Flannery or anyone else to
show me where Washington, Hamilton or anyone else at the Constitutional
Convention directly cited these verses and chapters of scripture for those
sections of the Constitution.

<p>Flannery’s article only gets worse:
<blockquote>
<p>Indeed, of the 15,000 political
writings of the men who crafted the Constitution, the source they quoted most
frequently in expressing their political beliefs was the Bible. A whopping 34
percent of their political quotes came straight out of the Book they hailed as
the inspired Word of God.
</blockquote>

<p>Another lie. This refers to a study done by
Donald S. Lutz, et al. which purported to find lots of quotations to the Bible
during the Founding era, particularly drawn from the pulpit. I’ve read the
study and it most certainly does not claim that the men who framed the
Constitution oft-cited the Bible for its propositions, because they didn’t. In
fact, the Lutz study admits this! <a
href="http://www.talk2action.org/story/2008/1/4/24725/53989">The following is
from the Lutz study</a>, discussing the Bible’s prominence when it came time to
framing the Constitution:

<p>“The Bible’s prominence disappears,
which is not surprising since the debate centered upon specific institutions
about which the Bible has little to say. The Anti-Federalists do drag it in
with respect to basic principles of government, but the Federalist’s
inclination to Enlightenment rationalism is most evident here in their failure
to consider the Bible relevant.”

<p>If that weren’t bad enough, Flannery’s article gets worse:
<blockquote>
<p>Prayer even played an integral role
at the Constitutional Convention. During a particularly contentious impasse,
Benjamin Franklin addressed the founders gathered there with this stinging
rebuke: “In the beginning of the contest with Great Britain, when we were
sensible of danger, we had daily prayer in this room for the Divine protection.
Our prayers, sir, were heard, and they were graciously answered. … And have we
now forgotten this powerful Friend? Or do we imagine we no longer need His
assistance? I have lived, sir, a long time, and the longer I live the more
convincing proofs I see of this truth, that God governs in the affairs of men.
And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, is it probable
that an empire can rise without His aid? We have been assured, sir, in the
Sacred Writings, that ‘except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that
build it.’ I firmly believe this; and I firmly believe that without His
concurring aid, we shall succeed in this political building no better than the
builders of Babel.”

<p>Upon concluding his remarks, a
motion for daily prayer was quickly adopted and the impasse was broken.
</blockquote>

<p>The quotation from Franklin is
accurate. What’s inaccurate is Flannery’s assertion that the motion for daily
prayer was “quickly adopted.” <a href="http://candst.tripod.com/franklin.htm">Actually
Madison’s notes from the Convention and other contemporaneous sources</a>
inform that Franklin’s call for prayer was not even voted on, that they didn’t
pray but moved on with their secular business.

<p>Alas, the article I’ve just
deconstructed is typical of the “Christian America” claim. This thesis relies
on utter untruths and it’s time honest, bible believing Christians close ranks
and move on.<p><hr><h3 align=center>
