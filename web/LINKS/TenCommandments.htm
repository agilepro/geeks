<h2>      The Ten Commandments - Both Sets</h2>
<h3>Exodus 20: 2-17, <i>The Ten Commandments. God punishes to the 3rd and 4th generation.</h3></i>
   2 I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
 1)  3 You shall have no other gods before me.
 2)  4 You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth
      beneath or in the waters below.
   5 You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God,
     punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who
     hate me,
   6 but showing love to a thousand {generations} of those who love me and keep my commandments.
 3)  7 You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless
     who misuses his name.
 4)  8 Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.
   9 Six days you shall labor and do all your work,
  10 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither
     you, nor your son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidservant, nor your animals, nor the alien
     within your gates.
  11 For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he
     rested on the seventh day.
     Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.
 5) 12 Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the LORD your God is
     giving you.
 6) 13 You shall not murder.
 7) 14 You shall not commit adultery.
 8) 15 You shall not steal.
 9) 16 You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.
10) 17 You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his
     manservant or maidservant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.

<i>NOTE: Deuteronomy 5:6-21 are almost the same as Exodus 20: 2-17.</i>

<h3>Exodus 34: 6-7, <i>God punishes to the 3rd and 4th generation.</i> (still)</h3>
The LORD, the LORD, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and
faithfulness, maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not
leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the fathers to
the third and fourth generation.

<h3>Exodus 34: 14-27, <i>The other Ten Commandments.</i> (approximate numbering)</h3>
 1) 14 Do not worship any other god, for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.
 2) 15 Be careful not to make a treaty with those who live in the land; for when they prostitute
     themselves to their gods and sacrifice to them, they will invite you and you will eat their
     sacrifices.
  16 And when you choose some of their daughters as wives for your sons and those daughters prostitute
     themselves to their gods, they will lead your sons to do the same.
 3) 17 Do not make cast idols.
 4) 18 Celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread. For seven days eat bread made without yeast, as I
     commanded you. Do this at the appointed time in the month of Abib, for in that month you came out
     of Egypt.
 5) 19 The first offspring of every womb belongs to me, including all the firstborn males of your
     livestock, whether from herd or flock.
  20 Redeem the firstborn donkey with a lamb, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. Redeem all
     your firstborn sons. No one is to appear before me empty-handed.
 6) 21 Six days you shall labor, but on the seventh day you shall rest; even during the plowing season
     the harvest you must rest.
 7) 22 Celebrate the Feast of Weeks with the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, and the Feast of
     Ingathering at the turn of the year.
  23 Three times a year all your men are to appear before the Sovereign LORD, the God of Israel.
  24 I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your territory, and no one will covet your land
     when you go up three times each year to appear before the LORD your God.
 8) 25 Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to me along with anything containing yeast, and do not let
     any of the sacrifice from the Passover Feast remain until morning.
 9) 26 Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the LORD your God.
10)    Do not cook a young goat in its mother's milk.
