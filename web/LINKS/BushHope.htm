that emphasize the importance of hoping for change.</p>

Bush presents his plan to fund organizations that hope for change.</tbody></table>
<p>"This bill acknowledges the immeasurable role of hope in
envisioning a better world for everyone," Bush said during a press
conference. "Starting today, I ask all Americans to hope together as
one nation that the difficult problems that grip our nation will go
away someday."
<p>The president's move will help direct federal funds to such
groups as the National Hope Foundation, which has been hoping for a
cure for cancer for nearly two decades.
<p>"There are many in our country who are without hope," Bush said.
"Yet there are many respected organizations in America that are
actively hoping things get better. This program will assist these
organizations in obtaining government grants, which will allow them
to continue the important hoping that must be done."
<p>Among the programs likely to receive funding is Project Hope You
Don't Get Sick, a non-profit organization hoping that over 45
million Americans receive the proper health care they need.
<p>Dream Job United, another likely recipient, is a widely acclaimed
program in which the ill-prepared and uneducated are trained to hope
for job interviews at top companies.
<p>Another project slated for assistance in is a Louisiana-based
teen-pregnancy reduction program, in which volunteers hope teens
abstain from intercourse.
<p>Under the bill, wish-based initiatives will also be eligible for
increased funding. Dozens of independent wishful-thinking
foundations, such as America Wishes Things Were Better, expect to
receive grants to fund distribution of pennies, wishbones, and
birthday candles.
<p>Those with wishes and hopes applauded the president's move,
saying that faith alone cannot rectify the nation's social ills.
<p>"Faith-based problem-solving is noble, but we should not discount
the power of hope," said veteran hoper Howard Thorndike, who heads
the Please Oh Please Institute, a Houston-based wish tank. "'Hail
Mary' strategies, for example, are a part of the fabric of our
nation, from the football field to the boardroom, and our government
ignores such traditions at its peril."
<p>Bush echoed Thorndike's sentiments. "As your president, I have
seen firsthand what hoping can do," he said. "I have heard stories
of decent people trapped under piles of rubble, and I have hoped
that they would be rescued. And eventually, many were. Recently,
powerful storms and destructive hurricanes ravaged some of our great
cities. I hope that you will join me in wishing that we do not get
hit by any more of those."
<p>Bush added: "Laura and I hope every night that good things will
happen for our great country. My fellow Americans, I call on you to
do the same."<p>
