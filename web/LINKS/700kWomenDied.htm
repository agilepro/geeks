<h2>700,000 women died due to reductions in family planning, a global study says</h2>
<h3>Maternal health survey faults cutbacks</h3>
By John Donnelly, Globe Staff, 9/26/2002<p>
WASHINGTON - The steep drop in worldwide family planning funds from the
United States and unmet pledges from other wealthy nations contributed
to more than 300 million unintended pregnancies and the deaths of an
estimated 700,000 pregnant women between 1995 and 2000, according to a
global study on maternal health released yesterday.<p>
The report, the first of its kind, found that more than one-third of the
deaths were from problems associated with pregnancy, labor, and
delivery. A majority of the deaths, an estimated 400,000, were from
complications resulting from abortions carried out in unsanitary and
often illegal conditions.<p>
The study, carried out by the Global Health Council, the largest
membership organization on global health issues, was launched to
assess progress made since the 1994 International Conference on
Population and Development in Cairo. At the conference, delegate
nations, including the United States, committed to spending $17
billion annually for reproductive health care for women.<p>
After the conference, the Clinton administration immediately
substantially increased funding to $580 million. But then two factors
caused funding to drop: a Republican-led budget-cutting revolution and
a push from antiabortion groups to enforce the so-called Mexico City
policy that bars US funds for any foreign organization that promotes
or performs abortions.<p>
The level of US funding for maternal health care - nearly $500 million
- still does not approach the 1994 levels.<p>
Timothy E. Wirth, who as undersecretary of state for global affairs
led the US delegation at Cairo, said the Clinton administration had
internally set a goal of $1 billion annually for family planning
within a few years. "The ideological war against the Cairo plan of
action has turned out to be massive war against women and against
protection from AIDS" due to the lack of availability of condoms, he
said.<p>
Two months ago, the Bush administration withheld $34 million in funds
from the United Nations family planning organization because it works
with Chinese authorities who are alleged to coerce women into
undergoing abortions and sterilizations.<p>
"Unfortunately, since 1994, the collateral victims were the women of
the developing world," said Nils Daulaire, president of the Global
Health Council, a nonprofit group based in Washington and White River
Junction, Vt. "This is a totally preventable tragedy.  We have the
technology, the means, and the cost is incredibly cheap.<p>
"For 35 years, the US led the world in supporting voluntary family
planning everywhere around the world. Both from our side and other
donors' side, it is clear this is one of the best investments one can
make in reducing the death toll around the world."<p>
Daulaire was a key player in the Clinton administration on health
issues, serving as the senior health adviser to the head of the US
Agency for International Development.<p>
The Bush administration has said it will cut off funding to any groups
associated with programs that force women to have abortions.
Population Research Institute of Fort Royal, Va., an antiabortion
group, has taken the lead in criticizing family planning
organizations, saying that some groups coerce women into having
abortions. In particular, the group sent undercover workers to Peru in
1998 and China this year. Scott Weinberg, director of governmental
affairs for the group, said that they found in China "forced
abortion, forced sterilization, destruction of homes for
noncompliance, and imprisonment for noncompliance." In Peru, they
said, the United States was funding a program in 1998 that promoted
massive sterilization.<p>
The World Health Organization, a United Nations body, annually
estimates numbers of maternal deaths, pegging the number at more than
549,000 deaths in 2000. The Global Health Council narrowed its focus
to unintended pregnancies, an extremely difficult task largely due to
poor reporting in many countries. They did it by taking statistics
from the US Census Bureau, UN agencies, country reports, and private
surveys; focusing on abortion rates and mothers dying from unwanted
births; and compiling a profile of all 227 countries in the world.<p>
Daulaire and other global health experts yesterday described the
estimates derived in the council's report as conservative. Their
reasoning is that since abortions are illegal in much of the world,
many cases are not reported.<p>
Allan Rosenfield, dean of Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia
University, reviewed the report prior to publication and said the data
is "very difficult to obtain, is not straightforward, and no one
collects these data adequately."<p>
But, he added, "Most of us feel the data are underreported."<p>
Global spending now is $11 billion for maternal health care, part of
which goes for HIV/AIDS programs, according to Population Action
International. Donors are contributing $2.6 billion, or 46 percent of
the Cairo target. Poor countries are spending 74 percent of their 1994
target. "This report provides an interesting way to answer the
question of what is the price of doing too little," said Sally
Ethelston, vice president for communication at Population Action
International, an independent group that advocates universal access
to reproductive health care.<p>
The report's country analyses highlights the lack of spending and
adequate programs in several countries. Most notable is India, which
by far led the world with an estimated 159,143 deaths from unintended
pregnancies. The United States had 349 deaths during the six-year
period, said the report.<p>John Donnelly can be reached at donnelly@globe.com.<p>
