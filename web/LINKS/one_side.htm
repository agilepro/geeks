<font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size=3>Accepting 'intelligent design' in science classrooms
would have disastrous consequences,<br>warn Richard Dawkins and Jerry Coyne
<p><b><a href=http://www.guardian.co.uk>The Guardian</a></b>, September 1, 2005
<p>It sounds so reasonable, doesn't
it? Such a modest proposal. Why not teach "both sides" and let the
children decide for themselves? As President Bush said, "You're asking me
whether or not people ought to be exposed to different ideas, the answer is
yes." At first hearing, everything about the phrase "both
sides" warms the hearts of educators like ourselves.
<p>One of us spent years as an Oxford tutor and it was his habit to choose
controversial topics for the students' weekly essays. They were required to go
to the library, read about both sides of an argument, give a fair account of
both, and then come to a balanced judgment in their essay. The call for
balance, by the way, was always tempered by the maxim, "When two opposite
points of view are expressed with equal intensity, the truth does not
necessarily lie exactly half way between. It is possible for one side simply
to be wrong."
<p>As teachers, both of us have found that asking our students to analyse
controversies is of enormous value to their education. What is wrong, then,
with teaching both sides of the alleged controversy between evolution and
creationism or "intelligent design" (ID)? And, by the way, don't be
fooled by the disingenuous euphemism. There is nothing new about ID. It is
simply creationism camouflaged with a new name to slip (with some success,
thanks to loads of tax-free money and slick public-relations professionals)
under the radar of the US Constitution's mandate for separation between church
and state.
<p>Why, then, would two lifelong educators and passionate advocates of the
"both sides" style of teaching join with essentially all biologists
in making an exception of the alleged controversy between creation and
evolution? What is wrong with the apparently sweet reasonableness of "it
is only fair to teach both sides"? The answer is simple. This is not a
scientific controversy at all. And it is a time-wasting distraction because
evolutionary science, perhaps more than any other major science, is
bountifully endowed with genuine controversy.
<p>Among the controversies that students of evolution commonly face, these are
genuinely challenging and of great educational value: neutralism versus
selectionism in molecular evolution; adaptationism; group selection;
punctuated equilibrium; cladism; "evo-devo"; the "Cambrian
Explosion"; mass extinctions; interspecies competition; sympatric
speciation; sexual selection; the evolution of sex itself; evolutionary
psychology; Darwinian medicine and so on. The point is that all these
controversies, and many more, provide fodder for fascinating and lively
argument, not just in essays but for student discussions late at night.
<p>Intelligent design is not an argument of the same character as these
controversies. It is not a scientific argument at all, but a religious one. It
might be worth discussing in a class on the history of ideas, in a philosophy
class on popular logical fallacies, or in a comparative religion class on
origin myths from around the world. But it no more belongs in a biology class
than alchemy belongs in a chemistry class, phlogiston in a physics class or
the stork theory in a sex education class. In those cases, the demand for
equal time for "both theories" would be ludicrous. Similarly, in a
class on 20th-century European history, who would demand equal time for the
theory that the Holocaust never happened?
<p>So, why are we so sure that intelligent design is not a real scientific
theory, worthy of "both sides" treatment? Isn't that just our
personal opinion? It is an opinion shared by the vast majority of professional
biologists, but of course science does not proceed by majority vote among
scientists. Why isn't creationism (or its incarnation as intelligent design)
just another scientific controversy, as worthy of scientific debate as the
dozen essay topics we listed above? Here's why.
<p>If ID really were a scientific theory, positive evidence for it, gathered
through research, would fill peer-reviewed scientific journals. This doesn't
happen. It isn't that editors refuse to publish ID research. There simply
isn't any ID research to publish. Its advocates bypass normal scientific due
process by appealing directly to the non-scientific public and - with great
shrewdness - to the government officials they elect.
<p>The argument the ID advocates put, such as it is, is always of the same
character. Never do they offer positive evidence in favour of intelligent
design. All we ever get is a list of alleged deficiencies in evolution. We are
told of "gaps" in the fossil record. Or organs are stated, by fiat
and without supporting evidence, to be "irreducibly complex": too
complex to have evolved by natural selection.
<p>In all cases there is a hidden (actually they scarcely even bother to hide
it) "default" assumption that if Theory A has some difficulty in
explaining Phenomenon X, we must automatically prefer Theory B without even
asking whether Theory B (creationism in this case) is any better at explaining
it. Note how unbalanced this is, and how it gives the lie to the apparent
reasonableness of "let's teach both sides". One side is required to
produce evidence, every step of the way. The other side is never required to
produce one iota of evidence, but is deemed to have won automatically, the
moment the first side encounters a difficulty - the sort of difficulty that
all sciences encounter every day, and go to work to solve, with relish.
<p>What, after all, is a gap in the fossil record? It is simply the absence of
a fossil which would otherwise have documented a particular evolutionary
transition. The gap means that we lack a complete cinematic record of every
step in the evolutionary process. But how incredibly presumptuous to demand a
complete record, given that only a minuscule proportion of deaths result in a
fossil anyway.
<p>The equivalent evidential demand of creationism would be a complete
cinematic record of God's behaviour on the day that he went to work on, say,
the mammalian ear bones or the bacterial flagellum - the small, hair-like
organ that propels mobile bacteria. Not even the most ardent advocate of
intelligent design claims that any such divine videotape will ever become
available.
<p>Biologists, on the other hand, can confidently claim the equivalent
"cinematic" sequence of fossils for a very large number of
evolutionary transitions. Not all, but very many, including our own descent
from the bipedal ape Australopithecus. And - far more telling - not a single
authentic fossil has ever been found in the "wrong" place in the
evolutionary sequence. Such an anachronistic fossil, if one were ever
unearthed, would blow evolution out of the water.
<p>As the great biologist J B S Haldane growled, when asked what might
disprove evolution: "Fossil rabbits in the pre-Cambrian." Evolution,
like all good theories, makes itself vulnerable to disproof. Needless to say,
it has always come through with flying colours.
<p>Similarly, the claim that something - say the bacterial flagellum - is too
complex to have evolved by natural selection is alleged, by a lamentably
common but false syllogism, to support the "rival" intelligent
design theory by default. This kind of default reasoning leaves completely
open the possibility that, if the bacterial flagellum is too complex to have
evolved, it might also be too complex to have been created. And indeed, a
moment's thought shows that any God capable of creating a bacterial flagellum
(to say nothing of a universe) would have to be a far more complex, and
therefore statistically improbable, entity than the bacterial flagellum (or
universe) itself - even more in need of an explanation than the object he is
alleged to have created.
<p>If complex organisms demand an explanation, so does a complex designer. And
it's no solution to raise the theologian's plea that God (or the Intelligent
Designer) is simply immune to the normal demands of scientific explanation. To
do so would be to shoot yourself in the foot. You cannot have it both ways.
Either ID belongs in the science classroom, in which case it must submit to
the discipline required of a scientific hypothesis. Or it does not, in which
case get it out of the science classroom and send it back into the church,
where it belongs.
<p>In fact, the bacterial flagellum is certainly not too complex to have
evolved, nor is any other living structure that has ever been carefully
studied. Biologists have located plausible series of intermediates, using
ingredients to be found elsewhere in living systems. But even if some
particular case were found for which biologists could offer no ready
explanation, the important point is that the "default" logic of the
creationists remains thoroughly rotten.
<p>There is no evidence in favour of intelligent design: only alleged gaps in
the completeness of the evolutionary account, coupled with the
"default" fallacy we have identified. And, while it is inevitably
true that there are incompletenesses in evolutionary science, the positive
evidence for the fact of evolution is truly massive, made up of hundreds of
thousands of mutually corroborating observations. These come from areas such
as geology, paleontology, comparative anatomy, physiology, biochemistry,
ethology, biogeography, embryology and - increasingly nowadays - molecular
genetics.
<p>The weight of the evidence has become so heavy that opposition to the fact
of evolution is laughable to all who are acquainted with even a fraction of
the published data. Evolution is a fact: as much a fact as plate tectonics or
the heliocentric solar system.
<p>Why, finally, does it matter whether these issues are discussed in science
classes? There is a case for saying that it doesn't - that biologists
shouldn't get so hot under the collar. Perhaps we should just accept the
popular demand that we teach ID as well as evolution in science classes. It
would, after all, take only about 10 minutes to exhaust the case for ID, then
we could get back to teaching real science and genuine controversy.
<p>Tempting as this is, a serious worry remains. The seductive "let's
teach the controversy" language still conveys the false, and highly
pernicious, idea that there really are two sides. This would distract students
from the genuinely important and interesting controversies that enliven
evolutionary discourse. Worse, it would hand creationism the only victory it
realistically aspires to. Without needing to make a single good point in any
argument, it would have won the right for a form of supernaturalism to be
recognised as an authentic part of science. And that would be the end of
science education in America.
<p><font size=3><b>Arguments worth having ...</font></b>
<p><b>The "Cambrian Explosion"</b>
<p>Although the fossil record shows that the first multicellular animals lived
about 640m years ago, the diversity of species was low until about 530m years
ago. At that time there was a sudden explosion of many diverse marine species,
including the first appearance of molluscs, arthropods, echinoderms and
vertebrates. "Sudden" here is used in the geological sense; the
"explosion" occurred over a period of 10m to 30m years, which is,
after all, comparable to the time taken to evolve most of the great radiations
of mammals. This rapid diversification raises fascinating questions;
explanations include the evolution of organisms with hard parts (which aid
fossilisation), the evolutionary "discovery" of eyes, and the
development of new genes that allowed parts of organisms to evolve
independently.
<p><b>The evolutionary basis of human behaviour</b>
<p>The field of evolutionary psychology (once called "sociobiology")
maintains that many universal traits of human behaviour (especially sexual
behaviour), as well as differences between individuals and between ethnic
groups, have a genetic basis. These traits and differences are said to have
evolved in our ancestors via natural selection. There is much controversy
about these claims, largely because it is hard to reconstruct the evolutionary
forces that acted on our ancestors, and it is unethical to do genetic
experiments on modern humans.
<p><b>Sexual versus natural selection</b>
<p>Although evolutionists agree that adaptations invariably result from
natural selection, there are many traits, such as the elaborate plumage of
male birds and size differences between the sexes in many species, that are
better explained by "sexual selection": selection based on members
of one sex (usually females) preferring to mate with members of the other sex
that show certain desirable traits. Evolutionists debate how many features of
animals have resulted from sexual as opposed to natural selection; some, like
Darwin himself, feel that many physical features differentiating human
"races" resulted from sexual selection.
<p><b>The target of natural selection</b>
<p>Evolutionists agree that natural selection usually acts on genes in
organisms - individuals carrying genes that give them a reproductive or
survival advantage over others will leave more descendants, gradually changing
the genetic composition of a species. This is called "individual
selection". But some evolutionists have proposed that selection can act
at higher levels as well: on populations (group selection), or even on species
themselves (species selection). The relative importance of individual versus
these higher order forms of selection is a topic of lively debate.
<p><b>Natural selection versus genetic drift</b>
<p>Natural selection is a process that leads to the replacement of one gene by
another in a predictable way. But there is also a "random"
evolutionary process called genetic drift, which is the genetic equivalent of
coin-tossing. Genetic drift leads to unpredictable changes in the frequencies
of genes that don't make much difference to the adaptation of their carriers,
and can cause evolution by changing the genetic composition of populations.
Many features of DNA are said to have evolved by genetic drift. Evolutionary
geneticists disagree about the importance of selection versus drift in
explaining features of organisms and their DNA. All evolutionists agree that
genetic drift can't explain adaptive evolution. But not all evolution is
adaptive.
