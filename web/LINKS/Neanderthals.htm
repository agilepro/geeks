<p>The past comes to us in tantalizing fragments — a bone here, a footprint
there. But of all the fragments yet discovered, perhaps none is so tantalizing
as the one published in the journal Science last week: the Neanderthal genome.
<p>Neanderthals have perplexed and intrigued us ever since the first bones were
discovered in a cave in what is now Germany, in 1856. Who were they? Why did
they vanish?</p>

<p>Over the past century and a half, our picture of them has become less blurry,
more distinct. From their bones we know that Neanderthals were bigger and
stronger than us "anatomically modern humans," and they had larger skulls that
boasted prominent eyebrow ridges. They appear to be the descendants of a lineage
that separated from ours around 400,000 years ago, wandered out of Africa, and
lived across Europe and central Asia. The last of the Neanderthals lived on the
Iberian peninsula, dying out sometime between 37,000 and 28,000 years ago.
<p>(Anatomically modern humans, in contrast, evolved in Africa, arriving at
recognizably modern skeletons between 130,000 and 200,000 years ago. Some time
later — 65,000 years ago or so — a group of them left Africa, wending their way
through the Middle East and across Eurasia, the Pacific and the Americas. These
were the ancestors of today's non-African populations; and in Europe and central
Asia, they coexisted with Neanderthals until the Neanderthals disappeared.)
<p>What else do we know about Neanderthals? They may have decorated their bodies
with ornaments; they certainly used tools like axes and spears. They hunted.
Indeed, they mostly seem to have eaten meat — they are sometimes described as
"top carnivores" — and because of their bigness, probably needed more calories
per day than we do.
<p>As our ability to retrieve and sequence ancient DNA has developed and
improved, we've been able to paint in further details. Some Neanderthals may
have had pale skin and red hair. Some of them could taste bitter flavors. They
may have had a capacity for speech, though we can't tell if they had much in the
way of language.
<p>And now, with the full genome sequence, we can start to answer many more
questions, both about Neanderthals and about ourselves. The idea is that if you
line up the sequences of humans, Neanderthals and chimpanzees, you can start to
trace which genetic changes occurred when. Unsurprisingly, the data suggest that
by far the bulk of our genetic evolution happened in the millions of years
before humans and Neanderthals separated; the handful of known differences
between us and Neanderthals occur in a motley ragbag of genes. (There's no
obvious stamp of rapid brain evolution, for example.)
<p>The sequence is an amazing accomplishment. Yes, it's preliminary and contains
plenty of errors. But think of this: the DNA was extracted from bones that are
tens of thousands of years old. Whereas the DNA in your cells is present in nice
long strings, in ancient specimens it's broken into tiny fragments, if it's
preserved at all. Then there's the problem of DNA swamping. Which is to say that
more than 95 percent of the DNA extracted from the bones belongs to microbes
that lived on the bones in the subsequent millennia; this had to be stripped
out. Ditto, the DNA from any humans who have handled those bones. As one of my
colleagues remarked, the "methods" section of the paper reads like a molecular
obstacle course. To have any useable DNA at all, let alone a full genome, is
astonishing. Hats off.
<p>And the results stoke the imagination, for they provide more evidence for
something that has long been suspected: Neanderthals are not just a quirky
sideshow in human evolution, but an intimate part of our own story. Many of us
have Neanderthals in our family tree, just as some of us have Hottentots, or
Aztecs, or Genghis Khan.
<p>Which isn't surprising. To be sure, Neanderthals were more genetically
distinct from us than any living humans are from one another. But they are still
our close relatives — kissing cousins, if you will — and when closely related
beings meet, they often take a shine to each other. Coyotes, for example,
sometimes cavort with dogs or wolves. Geoffroy's cat, a south American pussy,
sometimes gallivants with another local wildcat, the oncilla, even though their
lineages separated a million years ago — much longer ago than ours split from
Neanderthals. And ducks of many kinds seem to like mating with one another. Our
ancestors, it seems, were no different.
<p>All the same, the idea of Neanderthal ancestry brings a vividness to the
distant past. Were the men exotic and sexy? What were half-Neanderthal,
half-human children like? Were they extra-beautiful, as people with mixed
ancestries often are? Did they have an unusual hungering for red meat? Did we
learn Neanderthal customs, or languages?
<p>And it brings a greater poignancy to that other mystery — why did the
Neanderthals vanish?
<p>Here, lots of ideas have been put forward — a sure sign that no one knows.
Perhaps they died of mad Neanderthal disease, owing to a habit of feasting on
one another's brains. (This has been put forward as a serious hypothesis.)
Perhaps they were victims of a changing climate. Perhaps they were "inferior"
beings, unable to match our capacity for innovation in the face of adversity.
Perhaps their populations became too small, and too sparse, for them to find
mates. Or — and this is the most haunting possibility — perhaps they were
eventually murdered by their puny cousins. That is, us.</p>

<p>For the Neanderthal genome (and a complex lesson in how to extract
Neanderthal DNA), see Green, R. E. et al. 2010. "A draft sequence of the
Neandertal genome." Science 328: 710-722. This paper also provides evidence for
human-Neanderthal interbreeding. For a more detailed look at human-Neanderthal
differences, see Burbano, H. A. et al. 2010. "Targeted investigation of the
Neandertal genome by array-based sequence capture." Science 328: 723-725.

J. and Maley, B. 2005. "Neanderthal reconstructed." Anatomical Record 283B:
23-31.
<p>Working out what happened when in human history is a complex and
approximate business. I took the date of 400,000 years since the separation of
humans and Neanderthals from the Burbano paper mentioned above. Exactly when
Neanderthals disappeared from Europe is disputed. For the 28,000 years ago
claim, see Finlayson, C. et al. 2006. "Late survival of Neanderthals at the
southernmost extreme of Europe." Nature 443: 850-853. For the claim that the
real date is 37,000 years ago, see ZilhÃ£o, J. et al. 2010. "Pego do Diabo (Loures,
Portugal): dating the emergence of anatomical modernity in westernmost Eurasia."
PLoS One 5: e8880. The dates I give for anatomically modern humans are
approximate, but within the range that is generally accepted; see, for example,
Fagundes, N. J. R. et al. 2007. "Statistical evaluation of alternative models of
human evolution." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 104:
17614-17619; see also the references listed therein.
<p>Whether or not Neanderthals wore jewelry is vigorously contested; for
evidence that they did, and a discussion of why some people think they didn't,
see, for example, ZilhÃ£o, J. et al. 2010. "Symbolic use of marine shells and
mineral pigments by Iberian Neandertals." Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences USA 107: 1023-1028. For evidence that Neanderthals mostly ate meat and
count as "top carnivores," see Richards, M. P. and Trinkaus, E. 2009. "Isotopic
evidence for the diets of European Neanderthals and early modern humans."
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 106: 16034-16039. (These
authors also suggest that an inability to switch diets might somehow have led to
the Neanderthal extinction.) For Neanderthals and tools, see for example

Neanderthal group from El SidrÃ³n Cave (Asturias, Spain)." Oxford Journal of
Archaeology 29: 119-148.

Neanderthals." Science 318: 1453-1455. For their ability to taste bitterness,
see Lalueza-Fox, C. et al. 2009. "Bitter taste perception in Neanderthals
through the analysis of the TAS2R38 gene." Biology Letters 5: 809-811. For a
possible linguistic capacity, see Krause, J. et al. 2007. "The derived FOXP2

example, Trinkaus, E. 2007. "European early modern humans and the fate of the
Neandertals." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 104:

modern humans interact?" Biological Reviews 84: 245-257.
<p>For coyotes cavorting with wolves, see Kays, R., Curtis, A. and Kirchman,
J. J. 2010. "Rapid adaptive evolution of northeastern coyotes via hybridization
with wolves." Biological Letters 6: 89-93. For coyotes and dogs, see Adams, J.
R., Leonard, J. A., and Waits, L. P. 2003. "Widespread occurrence of a domestic
dog mitochondrial DNA haplotype in southeastern US coyotes." Molecular Ecology

similar goings-on in ducks can be found in MuÃ±oz-Fuentes, V. et al. 2007.

Molecular Ecology 16: 629-638.
<p>The suggestion that mad Neanderthal disease caused their demise has been
put forward several times; see, for example, Cooper, J. H. 2000. "Did
cannibalism and spongiform encephalopathy contribute to the demise of the
Neanderthals?" Mankind Quarterly 41: 175-180 and Underdown, S. 2008. "A
potential role for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in Neanderthal
extinction." Medical Hypotheses 71: 4-7. The notion that Neanderthals were
culturally inferior to us — and that this caused their extinction — is
pervasive; see, for example, Klein, R. G. 2003. "Whither the Neanderthals?"
Science 299: 1525-1527. For the possibility that small, sparse populations was
the eventual problem, see Hublin, J.-J. and Roebroeks, W. 2009. "Ebb and flow or
regional extinctions? On the character of Neandertal occupation of northern
environments." Comptes Rendus Palevol 8: 503-509. (This paper is also my source
for the claim that Neanderthals needed to eat more calories than we do.) For
other hypotheses, see Herrera, K. J. et al. 2009. "To what extent did
Neanderthals and modern humans interact?" Biological Reviews 84: 245-257.
