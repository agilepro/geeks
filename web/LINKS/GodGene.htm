<p>It’s not hard to see the divinity behind the water temples that dot
the rice terraces of Bali. It’s there in the white-clad high priest
presiding in the temple at the summit of a dormant volcano. It’s there
in the 23 priests serving along with him, selected for their jobs when
they were still children by a bevy of virgin priestesses. It’s there in
the rituals the priests perform to protect the island’s water, which in
turn is needed to nurture the island’s rice.
<p>If the divine is easy to spot, what’s harder to make out is the
banal. But it’s there too—in the meetings the priests convene to
schedule their planting dates and combat the problem of crop pests; in the
plans they draw up to maintain aqueducts and police conduits; in the
irrigation proposals they consider and approve, the dam proposals they
reject or amend. “The religion has a temple at every node in the
irrigation system,” says David Sloan Wilson, professor of biology and
anthropology at Binghamton University in Binghamton, New York. “The
priests make decisions and enforce the code of both religion and
irrigation.”
<p>Ask true believers of any faith to describe the most important thing
that drives their devotion, and they’ll tell you it’s not a thing at
all but a sense—a feeling of a higher power far beyond us. Western
religions can get a bit more doctrinaire: God has handed us laws and lore,
and it’s for us to learn and practice what they teach. For a
hell-raising species like ours, however—with too much intelligence for
our own good and too little discipline to know what to do with it—there
have always been other, more utilitarian reasons to get religion. Chief
among them is survival. Across the eons, the structure that religion
provides our lives helps preserve both mind and body. But that, in turn,
has raised a provocative question, one that’s increasingly debated in
the worlds of science and religion: Which came first, God or the need for
God? In other words, did humans create religion from cues sent from above,
or did evolution instill in us a sense of the divine so that we would
gather into the communities essential to keeping the species going?
<p>Just as a hurricane spins off tornadoes, this debate creates its own
whirlwind of questions: If some people are more spiritual than others, is
it nature or nurture that has made them so? If science has nothing to do
with spirituality and it all flows from God, why do some people hear the
divine word easily while others remain spiritually tone-deaf? Do such
ivied-hall debates about environment, heredity and anthropology have any
place at all in more exalted conversations about the nature of God?
<p>Even among people who regard spiritual life as wishful hocus-pocus,
there is a growing sense that humans may not be able to survive without
it. It’s hard enough getting by in a fang-and-claw world in which
killing, thieving and cheating pay such rich dividends. It’s harder
still when there’s no moral cop walking the beat to blow the whistle
when things get out of control. Best to have a deity on hand to rein in
our worst impulses, bring out our best and, not incidentally, give us a
sense that there’s someone awake in the cosmic house when the lights go
out at night and we find ourselves wondering just why we’re here in the
first place. If a God or even several gods can do all that, fine. And if
we sometimes misuse the idea of our gods—and millenniums of holy wars
prove that we do—the benefits of being a spiritual species will surely
outweigh the bloodshed.
<p>Far from being an evolutionary luxury then, the need for God may be a
crucial trait stamped deeper and deeper into our genome with every passing
generation. Humans who developed a spiritual sense thrived and bequeathed
that trait to their offspring. Those who didn’t risked dying out in
chaos and killing. The evolutionary equation is a simple but powerful one.
<p>Nowhere has that idea received a more intriguing going-over than in the
recently published book The God Gene: How Faith Is Hardwired into Our
Genes by molecular biologist Dean Hamer. Chief of gene structure at the
U.S. National Cancer Institute, Hamer not only claims that human
spirituality is an adaptive trait, but he also says he has located one of
the genes responsible, a gene that just happens to also code for
production of the neurotransmitters that regulate our moods. Our most
profound feelings of spirituality, according to a literal reading of
Hamer’s work, may be due to little more than an occasional shot of
intoxicating brain chemicals governed by our dna. “I’m a believer that
every thought we think and every feeling we feel is the result of activity
in the brain,” Hamer says. “I think we follow the basic law of nature,
which is that we’re a bunch of chemical reactions running around in a
bag.”
<p>Even for the casually religious, such seeming reductionism can rankle.
The very meaning of faith, after all, is to hold fast to something without
all the tidy cause and effect that science finds so necessary. Try parsing
things the way geneticists do, and you risk parsing them into dust. “God
is not something that can be demonstrated logically or rigorously,” says
Neil Gillman, a professor of Jewish philosophy at the Jewish Theological
Seminary in New York City. “[The idea of a God gene] goes against all my
personal theological convictions.” John Polkinghorne, a physicist who is
also Canon Theologian at England’s Liverpool Cathedral, agrees: “You
can’t cut [faith] down to the lowest common denominator of genetic
survival. It shows the poverty of reductionist thinking.”
<p>Is Hamer really guilty of such simplification? Could claims for a
so-called God gene be merely the thin end of a secular wedge, one that
risks prying spirituality away from God altogether? Or, assuming the gene
exists at all, could it somehow be embraced by both science and religion,
in the same way some evolutionists and creationists—at least the less
radicalized ones—accept the idea of a divinely created universe in which
evolving life is simply part of the larger plan? Hamer, for one, hopes so.
“My findings are agnostic on the existence of God,” he says. “If
there’s a God, there’s a God. Just knowing what brain chemicals are
involved in acknowledging that is not going to change the fact.”
<p>Whatever the merits of Hamer’s work, he is clearly the heir of a
millenniums-long search for the wellsprings of spirituality. People have
been wrestling with the roots of faith since faith itself was first
codified into Scripture. “[God has] set eternity in the hearts of
men,” says the Book of Ecclesiastes, “yet they cannot fathom what God
has done from beginning to end.”
<p>To theologians in the 3rd century B.C., when Ecclesiastes is thought to
have been written, that passage spoke to the idea that while all of us are
divinely inspired to look for God, none of us are remotely capable of
fully comprehending what we are seeking. Scientists in the 21st century
may not disagree, provided that “hearts of men” is replaced with
“genes of men.” The key for those researchers is finding those genes.
<p>Hamer began looking in 1998, when he was conducting a survey on smoking
and addiction for the National Cancer Institute. As part of his study, he
recruited more than 1,000 men and women, who agreed to take a
standardized, 240-question personality test called the Temperament and
Character Inventory (tci). Among the traits the tci measures is one known
as self-transcendence, which consists of three other traits:
self-forgetfulness, or the ability to get entirely lost in an experience;
transpersonal identification, or a feeling of connectedness to a larger
universe; and mysticism, or an openness to things not literally provable.
Put them all together, and you come as close as science can to measuring
what it feels like to be spiritual. “This allows us to have the kind of
experience described as religious ecstasy,” says Robert Cloninger, a
psychiatrist at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, and the
designer of the self-transcendence portion of the tci.
<p>Hamer decided to use the data he gathered in the smoking survey to
conduct a little spirituality study on the side. First he ranked the
participants along Cloninger’s self-transcendence scale, placing them on
a continuum from least to most spiritually inclined. Then he went poking
around in their genes to see if he could find the dna responsible for the
differences. Spelunking in the human genome is not easy, what with 35,000
genes consisting of 3.2 billion chemical bases. To narrow the field, Hamer
confined his work to nine specific genes known to play major roles in the
production of monoamines—brain chemicals, including serotonin,
norepinephrine and dopamine, that regulate such fundamental functions as
mood and motor control. It’s monoamines that are carefully manipulated
by Prozac and other antidepressants. It’s also monoamines that are not
so carefully scrambled by ecstasy, lsd, peyote and other mind-altering
drugs—some of which have long been used in religious rituals.
<p>Studying the nine candidate genes in dna samples provided by his
subjects, Hamer quickly hit the genetic jackpot. A variation in a gene
known as vmat2—for vesicular monoamine transporter—seemed to be
directly related to how the volunteers scored on the self-transcendence
test. Those with the nucleic acid cytosine in one particular spot on the
gene ranked high. Those with the nucleic acid adenine in the same spot
ranked lower. “A single change in a single base in the middle of the
gene seemed directly related to the ability to feel self-transcendence,”
Hamer says. Merely having that feeling did not mean those people would
take the next step and translate their transcendence into a belief in—or
even a quest for—God. But they seemed likelier to do so than those who
never got the feeling at all.
<p>Hamer is careful to point out that the gene he found is by no means the
only one that affects spirituality. Even minor human traits can be
governed by the interplay of many genes; something as complex as belief in
God could involve hundreds or even thousands. “If someone comes to you
and says, ‘We’ve found the gene for X,’” says John Burn, medical
director of the Institute of Human Genetics at the University of Newcastle
in England, “you can stop them before they get to the end of the
sentence.”
<p>Hamer also stresses that while he may have located a genetic root for
spirituality, that is not the same as a genetic root for religion.
Spirituality is a feeling or a state of mind; religion is the way that
state gets codified into law. Our genes don’t get directly involved in
writing legislation. As Hamer puts it, perhaps understating a bit the
emotional connection many have to their religions, “Spirituality is
intensely personal; religion is institutional.”
<p>At least one faith, according to one of its best-known scholars,
formalizes the idea of gene-based spirituality and even puts a pretty spin
on it. Buddhists, says Robert Thurman, professor of Buddhist studies at
Columbia University, have long entertained the idea that we inherit a
spirituality gene from the person we were in a previous life. Smaller than
an ordinary gene, it combines with two larger physical genes we inherit
from our parents, and together they shape our physical and spiritual
profile. Says Thurman: “The spiritual gene helps establish a general
trust in the universe, a sense of openness and generosity.” Buddhists,
he adds, would find Hamer’s possible discovery “amusing and fun.”
<p>The Buddhist theory has never been put to the scientific test, but
other investigations into the biological roots of belief in God were being
conducted long before Hamer’s efforts—often with intriguing results.
In 1979, investigators at the University of Minnesota began their now
famous twins study, tracking down 53 pairs of identical twins and 31 pairs
of fraternal twins that had been separated at birth and raised apart. The
scientists were looking for traits the members of each pair had in common,
guessing that the characteristics shared more frequently by identical
twins than by fraternal twins would be genetically based, since identical
twins carry matching dna, and those traits for which there was no
disparity between the identicals and fraternals would be more
environmentally influenced.
<p>As it turned out, the identical twins had plenty of remarkable things
in common. In some cases, both suffered from migraine headaches, both had
a fear of heights, both were nail biters. Some shared little
eccentricities, like flushing the toilet both before and after using it.
When quizzed on their religious values and spiritual feelings, the
identical twins showed a similar overlap. In general, they were about
twice as likely as fraternal twins to believe as much—or as
little—about spirituality as their sibling did. Significantly, these
numbers did not hold up when the twins were questioned about how
faithfully they practiced any organized religion. Clearly, it seemed, the
degree to which we observe rituals such as attending services is mostly
the stuff of environment and culture. Whether we’re drawn to God in the
first place is hardwired into our genes. “It completely contradicted my
expectations,” says University of Minnesota psychologist Thomas
Bouchard, one of the researchers involved in the work. Similar results
were later found in larger twin studies in Virginia and Australia.
<p>Other researchers have taken the science in a different direction,
looking not for the genes that code for spirituality but for how that
spirituality plays out in the brain. Neuroscientist Andrew Newberg of the
University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine has used several types of
imaging systems to watch the brains of subjects as they meditate or pray.
By measuring blood flow, he determines which regions are responsible for
the feelings the volunteers experience. The deeper that people descend
into meditation or prayer, Newberg found, the more active the frontal lobe
and the limbic system become. The frontal lobe is the seat of
concentration and attention; the limbic system is where powerful feelings,
including rapture, are processed. More revealing is the fact that at the
same time these regions flash to life, another important region—the
parietal lobe at the back of the brain—goes dim. It’s this lobe that
orients the individual in time and space. Take it off-line, and the
boundaries of the self fall away, creating the feeling of being at one
with the universe. Combine that with what’s going on in the other two
lobes, and you can put together a profound religious experience.
<p>Even to some within the religious community, this does not come as
news. “In India in Buddha’s time, there were philosophers who said
there was no soul; the mind was just chemistry,” says Thurman. “The
Buddha disagreed with their extreme materialism but also rejected the
‘absolute soul’ theologians.” Michael Persinger, professor of
behavioral neuroscience at Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ont., puts
the chemistry argument more bluntly. “God,” he says, “is an artifact
of the brain.”
<p>Even if such spiritual deconstructionism is true, some scientists—to
say nothing of most theologians—think it takes you only so far,
particularly when it comes to trying to determine the very existence of
God. Simply understanding the optics and wiring of the eyes, after all,
doesn’t mean there’s no inherent magnificence in the Rembrandts they
allow us to see. If human beings were indeed divinely assembled, why
wouldn’t our list of parts include a genetic chip that would enable us
to contemplate our maker?
<p>“Of course, concepts of God reside in the brain. They certainly
don’t reside in the toe,” says Lindon Eaves, director of the Virginia
Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics at Virginia Commonwealth
University in Richmond. “The question is, To what is this wiring
responsive? Why is it there?”
<p>Says Paul Davies, professor of natural philosophy at Macquarie
University in Sydney, Australia: “I think a lot of people make the
mistake of thinking that if you explain something, you explain it away. I
don’t see that at all with religious experience.”
<p>Those religious believers who are comfortable with the idea that God
genes are the work of God should have little trouble making the next leap:
that not only are the genes there but they are central to our survival,
one of the hinges upon which the very evolution of the human species
turned. It’s an argument that’s not terribly hard to make.
<p>For one thing, God is a concept that appears in human cultures all over
the globe, regardless of how geographically isolated they are. When tribes
living in remote areas come up with a concept of God as readily as nations
living shoulder to shoulder, it’s a fairly strong indication that the
idea is preloaded in the genome rather than picked up on the fly. If
that’s the case, it’s an equally strong indication that there are very
good reasons it’s there.
<p>One of those reasons might be that, as the sole species—as far as we
know—capable of contemplating its own death, we needed something larger
than ourselves to make that knowledge tolerable. “Anticipation of our
own demise is the price we pay for a highly developed frontal lobe,”
says Persinger. “In many ways, [a God experience is] a brilliant
adaptation. It’s a built-in pacifier.”
<p>But the most important survival role religion may serve is as the
mortar that holds a group together. Worshipping God doesn’t have to be a
collective thing; it can be done in isolation, disconnected from any
organized religion. The overwhelming majority of people, however,
congregate to pray, observing the same rituals and heeding the same
creeds. Once that congregation is in place, it’s only a small step to
using the common system of beliefs and practices as the basis for all the
secular laws that keep the group functioning.
<p>One of the best examples of religion as social organizer, according to
Binghamton University’s Wilson, is early Calvinism. John Calvin rose to
prominence in 1536 when, as a theologian and religious reformer, he was
recruited to help bring order to the fractious city of Geneva. Calvin,
perhaps one of the greatest theological minds ever produced by European
Christianity, was a lawyer by trade. Wilson speculates that it was
Calvin’s pragmatic genius to understand that while civil laws alone
might not be enough to bring the city’s deadbeats and other malefactors
into line, divine law might be.
<p>Calvin’s catechism included the familiar Ten Commandments—which,
with their injunctions against theft, murder, adultery and lying, are
themselves effective social organizers. Added to that were admonitions to
pay taxes, perform civic duties, behave in a civil manner and submit to
the authority of magistrates. “You must understand religions very
thoroughly in relation to their environments,” says Wilson. “And one
problem for Calvin was to make his city function.”
<p>The heirs to Calvinism today—Presbyterians, many Baptists and
believers in the Reformed tradition in general—see the roots of their
faith as something far more divine than merely good civic management. But
even some theologians seem to think that a deep belief in the laws of God
can coexist with the survival demands of an evolving society. “Calvin
had a reverence for the Scriptures, which then became
institutionalized,” says James Kay, professor of practical theology at
the Princeton Theological Seminary. “The Bible is concerned about
justice for the poor, equity and fairness, and all of those things were
seen to in Calvin’s Geneva.”
<p>Other struggling cultures have similarly translated godly law into
earthly order and in doing so helped ensure their survival. The earliest
Christians established a rough institutional structure that allowed them
to transmit their ideas within a generation of Christ’s death, and as a
result succeeded in living through the Roman persecution; the Jews of the
Diaspora moved as a cultural whole through the nations of Europe, finding
niches wherever they could but maintaining their identity and kinship by
observing the same rites. “All religions become a bit secular,” says
Wilson. “In order to survive, you have to organize yourselves into a
culture.”
<p>The downside to all this is that often religious groups gather not into
congregations but into camps—and sometimes they’re armed camps. In a
culture of Crusades, Holocausts and jihads, where in the world is the
survival advantage of religious wars or terrorism? One facile explanation
has always been herd culling—an adaptive way of keeping populations down
so that resources aren’t depleted. But there’s little evolutionary
upside to wiping out an entire population of breeding-age males, as
countries trying to recover from wars repeatedly learn. Why then do we so
often let the sweetness of religion curdle into combat?
<p>The simple answer might be that just because we’re given a gift, we
don’t necessarily always use it wisely. Fire can either light your
village or burn down the one next door, depending on your inclination.
“Religions represent an attempt to harness innate spirituality for
organizational purposes—not always good,” says Macquarie
University’s Davies. And while spiritual contemplation is intuitive,
says Washington University’s Cloninger, religion is dogmatic; dogma in
the wrong hands has always been a risky thing.
<p>Still, for every place in the world that’s suffering from religious
strife, there are many more where spirituality is doing its uplifting and
civilizing work. A God who would equip us with the genes and the smarts to
cooperate in such a clever way is a God who ought to be appealing even to
religious purists. Nonetheless, sticking points do remain that prevent
genetic theory from going down smoothly. One that’s particularly
troublesome is the question of why Hamer’s God gene—or any of the
others that may eventually be discovered—is distributed so unevenly
among us. Why are some of us spiritual virtuosos, while others can’t
play a note? Isn’t it one of the central tenets of religion that grace
is available to everybody? At least a few scientists shrug at the
question. “Some get religion, and some don’t,” says Virginia
Commonwealth University’s Eaves.
<p>But this seeming inequity may be an important part of the spiritual
journey.
