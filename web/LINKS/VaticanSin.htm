<h1>The Vatican's Sin of Omission</h1>By ARTHUR HERTZBERG<br>May 14, 2005
<p>LAST week, Pope Benedict XVI vowed to Rome's former chief rabbi that he
would renew the Vatican's commitment to Catholic-Jewish dialogue. The
statement, which came at the same time that Germany unveiled its new Holocaust
memorial in central Berlin, was but one of several gestures the new pope has
extended toward a receptive Jewish community. The Israeli government, the
Anti-Defamation League and the European Jewish Congress have welcomed these
overtures and urged Benedict to continue his predecessor's work.
<p>But from my own experience as the chairman, more than 30 years ago, of
the first international Jewish delegation to meet formally with a comparable
delegation from the Vatican, I am far from certain that a new age in the
Jewish-Catholic relationship has dawned. At that Paris meeting in 1971, we
asked the Vatican to acknowledge that it had remained silent while Europe's
Jews were murdered. The Catholic delegation responded that it was not
empowered to act.
<p>The delegates were following the instructions of the Vatican's commission
on theology, which held that the policies of Pope Pius XII and the church
under the Nazis could not be questioned, because the church and its leader
are, as the First Vatican Council declared in 1870, free of error on matters
of doctrine and morality. When Cardinal Ratzinger became the head of that
Vatican commission, he issued the same advice to Pope John Paul II, who
pronounced the murder of six million Jews by the Nazis an unspeakable crime,
but a crime by some Catholics, not by the church.
<p>This position obscures the fact that in 1930's and 1940's Europe, the
Roman Catholic Church was the only institution that possessed the moral
stature and strength to denounce and forbid the murder of the Jews. It did
not do so. And in all the years since, rather than acknowledging this
failure to provide moral leadership in the critical hour, the Vatican has
repeatedly claimed that while individual Catholics behaved sinfully or
misunderstood what the church taught, the sin of letting the Holocaust
happen at its doorstep need not haunt the church as an institution.
<p>This remained the Vatican's view throughout the 1990's, even though both
the German and the French bishops' national conferences issued ringing
confessions of their wartime sins. In 1995 the German bishops pointed out
that the "church community" had "looked too fixedly at the
threat to their own institutions" and "remained silent about the
crimes committed against Jews and Judaism."
<p>The French bishops, for their part, stirringly concluded their September
1997 statement with the following words: "In the face of so great and
utter a tragedy, too many of the church's pastors committed an offense, by
their silence, against the church itself and its mission," and added:
"This failing of the church of France and of her responsibility toward
the Jewish people are part of our history. We confess this sin. We beg God's
pardon, and we call upon the Jewish people to hear our words of
repentance."
<p>Not only did the Vatican fail to adopt a similar attitude of contrition,
but Pope John Paul II and Cardinal Edward Cassidy, who was then in charge of
Jewish-Catholic relations, devalued the French and German bishops'
statements.
<p>When he was elected, Benedict XVI knew that there were doubts about him
within the Jewish community, and he tried to allay them. His supporters
could point to some significant achievements from his quarter-century as
guardian of Catholic orthodoxy. Under John Paul II, the Vatican forbade the
teaching of anti-Semitism, for example, and Cardinal Ratzinger authorized
the publication of a 2002 report expressing regret that certain New
Testament passages condemning individual Jews had been used to justify
anti-Semitism. He added, "It cannot be denied that a certain
insufficient resistance by Christians to this atrocity is explained by the
anti-Judaism present in the soul of more than a few Christians."
<p>What Cardinal Ratzinger did not do, however, was to question the orthodox
Catholic position that though individual Catholics can err morally, the
church and the pope cannot. Until the Vatican reconsiders that outlook, one
of the Holocaust's greatest wounds will continue to fester - namely, that
the major European institution that stood for morality looked away from
genocide. No amount of personal outreach toward the Jews and Judaism from
the new pope will make the Jews forget that the institution of which he is
the monarch has not come to terms with that history.
