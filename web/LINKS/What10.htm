<hr><h1 align=center>WHAT Ten Commandments?!</h1><hr>
<p><b>If I hear the words "Ten Commandments" one more time I think
I'll throw up. I don't know whether I'm more pissed off or depressed. I'd say
it's too close to call. I am as stunned as anyone by the audacious,
sanctimonious and entirel<i>y unconstitutional</i> actions of the House of
Representatives. On June 17, 1999, they voted in favor of displaying the Ten
Commandments in public buildings, including of course schools. The House showed
yet again that they are determined to make the USA a theocracy. If ever a House
vote could be said to be not just wrong but <i>stupid</i>, this is it. The vote
was 248-180. And it is stupid as hell.
<p>Why? The unconstitutional nature of their outrageous proposal is
practically a given. How they could not know that is beyond me. The time that's
being wasted over this nonsense, at taxpayer expense, will only increase as the
inevitable court challenge comes about if this insanity is made law. The vote
itself was just a knee-jerk, backlash reaction to the country's anger about the
availability of guns, following the shooting massacre at Columbine High School.
But instead of focusing on our preposterous gun laws, the House played the
religious card and began singing the Moral Values Begin in Church Anthem. (<i>Which
kind</i> of church?!)
<p>(I still haven't figured out [1] when the amendment was passed that made
the NRA the fourth branch of government or [2] what the hell is the NRA's
problem with waiting periods?! They fight them tooth and nail, but why? The only
possible answer is that if someone flies into a blind rage, like O.J. on a bad
day; and goes into a gun shop to buy a gun to blow away his entire family or
faculty or student body; and then has to wait three days, he might lose some of
that rage and not be able to do it. Blow away all those people I mean. I guess
the NRA doesn't want us to have that right taken away from us---to blow away
lots of people I mean. So I guess we owe the NRA thanks after all for looking
out for our "rights." To blow away people I mean.)
<p>In addition, the mere suggestion that nailing a religious plaque on a
schoolroom wall would have the slightest effect whatsoever on crazed,
rage-filled murderous lunatics, is an insult to the slimmest intelligence. It is
just an attempt by the Religious Right to get a foot in the door so that they
can continue their never-ending, zealous, <i>unconstitutional </i>attempts to
proselytize in all public arenas.
<p>But there are some other not so obvious reasons why this whole thing is
foolish. For those of you who have read my first book, I'm afraid some of this
will be redundant. But if I don't shout it from the rooftops, <i>now</i>, I may
suffer severe internal injuries or something.
<p>There <i>are no</i> "Ten Commandments" anywhere in the Bible. I
will repeat this since so many people, including and especially Christians, have
no idea what's in the Bible. There <i>are no</i> Ten Commandments. Just as I am
always asking <i>which</i> God you are talking about, since there are so many to
choose from, I am now asking <i>which</i> Ten Commandments you are talking
about, since there are so many to choose from. While it is true that in Exodus
20 there is a list of things to do and not to do, it is <i>not</i> true that the
list has ten rules. The only way to wring the magic number ten out of it is if
you ignore some of the directives and lump several others together and call them
one. It is totally arbitrary, totally misleading and just plain wrong.
<p>For example, the so-called Ten Commandments begin in Exodus 20, verse 2 or
3, and end with verse 17. Yes, it takes fifteen or sixteen verses to name ten
directives---if you accept that there <i>are</i> ten directives. The Jewish
version of the first of these commandments is "I am the LORD thy God"
(Exod 20:2); but Christians consider that a preamble, and claim that "Thou
shalt have no other gods before me" (Exod 20:3) is the first commandment.
So who is correct? They can't both be right, can they?
<p>In addition, in Exod 20:24, just seven verses after the misnamed
Decalogue, there is <i>another</i> definite commandment. It is clearly an
imperative. Here it is: "An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and
shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep,
and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and
I will bless thee." So why is this commandment simply ignored?! How is it
any different from the others?
<p>Mr. Bob Barr should be sacrificing sheep and oxen in his backyard. He was
clearly told to do so. There is no ambiguity in that commandment. It should be
ox and sheep time everywhere in the Bible Belt.
<p>But even worse than the oxen and sheep thing is what happens in Exodus
chapters 13, 23, 34 and 35---in fact, the entire Old Testament. It is literally <i>packed</i>
with commandments just as forceful and just as clear (or unclear, depending on
your point of view) as those in Exodus 20 (however many there are). But somehow
they didn't make the Top Ten list.
<p>Confusing things further, in Exodus 34, the commandments given there are
actually described as "replacements." Why? Because Moses dropped and
broke the first set of tablets, the ones he got in Exodus 20. What a klutz!
"And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the
first: and <i>I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first
tables</i>, which thou brakest." (Exod 34:1) [Emphasis mine.] With these
words, along with slamming Moses for being such a putz, God is saying that the
words from the first tablets will be the same as those on the second set. Again,
no ambiguity.
<p>But the two lists aren't even close. Compare the two lists, supposedly
identical, keeping in mind that I, like everyone else, have to arbitrarily
number the commandments:

<p>1. Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the

<p>2. For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name

<p>How can those two lists be so utterly different? When old butter fingers
Moses dropped the first set of tablets, the second set was supposed to be a
duplicate, remember? So who decided which were to be <i>the</i> Ten
Commandments?! And how did they decide? Did someone take a vote? Toss a coin?
Arm wrestle for their favorites? To repeat, there <i>are no</i> Ten
Commandments.<br>
<p>(For the sake of space, from this point on I will summarize the
commandments; but I will always provide the exact chapter and verse so you can
see I haven't changed anything. It's all there.)<br>
<p>Likewise, why are the multitudinous <i>other</i> commandments not talked
about? Here's a random sampling: Sons that are gluttons and drunkards <i>shall</i>
be stoned to death. (Deut 21:21) Non-virginal brides <i>shall</i> be stoned to
death. (Deut 22:21) Homosexuals <i>shall surely</i> be put to death. (Lev 20:13)
Beat your children with rods. (Prov 23:14) Women must keep their mouths shut and
learn only from their husbands. (I Cor 14:34,35)<br>
<p>Surely no one would suggest that these laws represent the epitome of
morality! Yet the Religious Right Representatives in the House, such as Bob Barr
and Robert Aderholt, consider the Exodus 20 list (heavily edited to make the
nice round number ten) to be that very epitome. But look at what is <i>not</i>
mentioned. Nowhere are there any words forbidding: sexual or physical abuse of a
child; rape; slavery; torture; kidnapping; or spousal abuse. But almost as bad
is that there is no mention of <i>love</i> and <i>compassion</i> for others.
What the heck kind of Grand Moral Code would not mention those things?! A very
bad one. That's what kind.<br>
<p>The claim that the Ten Commandments are <i>not</i> promoting a certain
religion, but just encouraging morality, is so outrageously disingenuous as to
be difficult to respond to. The first <i>four</i> of the ten
"official" commandments address nothing but rules for worshipping the
Hebrew God. The remaining six are uninspired, insipid, incomplete, childish
nothings. Almost a<i>nyone</i> could come up with a better list.<br>
<p>However, if Mr. Bob Barr and the rest of his ilk really think the Bible, <i>all
of it</i>, is the inspired word of God, then they should be destroying altars,
breaking images, cutting down groves, keeping the feast of unleavened bread,
offering firstborn animals as sacrifices, and observing the feast of weeks. Oh,
and they should be taking great pains <i>not</i> to seethe a kid in its mother's
milk. (I never could make heads or tails out of that one.) But these are clear
cut commands, not suggestions. So, Mr. Barr, et al., you'd better head for the
nearest Muslim mosque with a battering ram, and fire up those barbecue pits.<br>
<p>Such selective editing and culling of the biblical commandments (actually
it's slash-and-burn editing and culling since it eliminates 99% of the Bible's
commandments) is the result of the embarrassingly <i>primitive</i> nature of the
excluded commandments. Sacrificing animals to gods is Stone Age stuff. But
Neanderthal mentality notwithstanding, if fundamentalists are going to insist on
their right to force <i>their</i> primitive commandments into public places,
then any of the rest of us should be able to post <i>our</i> primitive
suggestions for moral behavior, such as the Code of Hammurabi, or the biblical
parts about seething kids in milk. Or maybe even some of the commandments of my
own personal deity, Bob the Raingod:
<p>1. Thou shalt not hog the remote control.
<p>2. Remember Ground Hog Day and keep it holy.
<p>3. Honor thy Web Master that thy site may flourish.
<p>4. Thou shalt not pee in thy neighbor's pool.
<p>5. Thou shalt not stick a fork into a toaster.
<p>6. Thou shalt not break wind in mixed company; but if thou failest, and
doth indeed pass gas, thou shalt not suddenly stare at thy spouse with an
accusing look on thy face.
<p>7. Thou shalt not pick all the cashews out of the mixed nuts.
<p>8. Thou shalt not chew gum in class unless you bring enough for everyone.
<p>9. Husbands, thou shalt not complain if thy wives complaineth that thou
wilt not ask for directions.
<p>10. Thou shalt not balance thy checkbook while standing at an ATM.
