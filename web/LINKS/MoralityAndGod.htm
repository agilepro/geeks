<h2 align=center><b>DOES MORALITY REQUIRE GOD?</b> by John B. Hodges</h2>

<p>One argument often used by Christians trying to prove the existence
of their God is as follows: If God does not exist, then there are no
objective moral values.&nbsp; There are objective moral values.&nbsp; Therefore,
God exists.

<p>Those who use this argument also claim that Atheists cannot have any
basis for acting morally; they grudgingly admit that Atheists can act
morally, but insist that we have no rational, secular grounds for
doing so.

<p>For example, William Lane Craig is a Christian Apologist who has made
a career of debating Atheists in public forums.&nbsp; His manner and
delivery are smooth, authoritative, professional.&nbsp; Many people find
him persuasive.&nbsp; To prove the existence of his God, Craig uses the
moral argument, among others.

<p>For example, On Wednesday, Feb. 18, 1998, Craig debated Atheist
philosopher Antony Flew at the University of Wisconsin.&nbsp; Sue A.
Strandberg wrote, in her review of the debate:<BLOCKQUOTE>
Craig then made an emotional appeal to our sense that our ethics are also the
result of transcendent design: if there is no God, then there can be no Objective
Moral Values.&nbsp; He interprets this to mean that, without Objective Values,
there is no reason to have any values at all: the death of God means the
death of meaning.&nbsp; Craig here gave a sad and sorry picture of the kind of
universe this would be, and then proceeded to assert that, in this bleak
"Atheist view," there could be "nothing wrong with rape." Since we know
that "some things are really wrong," then Objective Values exist, which
means that God must exist.<br>
[Later in the debate:]<br>
Here Craig proceeded to take advantage of Flewís failure to address the Objective Morality argument by
creating the Atheist position himself, and attacking that: Atheists say
that human beings are just animals, and animals donít have morality.&nbsp; Thus
Atheists do not believe in morality.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Peter La Casse wrote another review of the same debate:<BLOCKQUOTE>
Dr. Craig stated that without God, there is no reason why objective
moral laws must exist.&nbsp; That is not to say that people who do not
believe in God cannot live moral lives; the question is, are there
objective moral standards without God?&nbsp; The answer is no: without God,
there is no reason to believe in objective moral standards.&nbsp; Yet we
all (or most of us) recognize that there are objective moral
standards: rape, murder, etc. are morally wrong.<br>
Summary:<br>
1. Without God, there are no moral absolutes<br>
2. There are moral absolutes.<br>
3. Thus, God exists.<br>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>This argument is very important.&nbsp; The contemporary writer Kay Nolte
Smith (1932-1993) wrote:<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Our world, even at its most rational, has never fully rejected the...
supernatural, which has been kept alive by the church.&nbsp; And the church is
kept alive because it has a stranglehold on the idea of Good and Evil.&nbsp; Human
beings need a code of good and evil to live by, and whatever else the church
has had to abandon over the centuries, it has convinced most of the world
that morality belongs to religion.&nbsp; Witness the historical split between
science and ethics, recognized by most thinkers...&nbsp; As long as religion
maintains its virtual monopoly on morality, it will be a significant
force...&nbsp; and as long as we have religion, two things will keep taking place
in the name of God: fraud and destruction."<br>
(Reprinted in <i>Women Without Superstition</i>, page 562.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>What can we say about this argument?&nbsp; The claim that morality can only
come from God, that there are no rational secular grounds for
morality, is a large claim.&nbsp; God might say, for example, that we
should eat fish on Fridays.&nbsp; He could just as well have told us to eat
fish on Wednesdays, or eat turnips on Fridays.&nbsp; Such orders are
completely arbitrary; there is no reason behind them and no sense in
them.&nbsp; We have no reason for following them other than that God
commanded them.&nbsp; The moral argument for the existence of God says that
morality is like this also; there is no reason not to kill, steal,
lie, rape, or whatever, other than that God said not to.&nbsp; Indeed, if
God had commanded the opposite, we would be morally required to kill,
steal, lie, rape, or whatever God commanded.

<p>My thesis is: Religious morality is subjective.&nbsp; Secular morality CAN be objective.

<p>Some definitions, from <i>Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 10th edition.</i>

<p>OBJECTIVE: ... in the realm of sensible experience, independent of
individual thought and perceptible by all observers; having reality
independent of the mind.... perceptible to persons other than the
affected individual... OBJECTIVISM: an ethical theory that moral good
is objectively real or that moral precepts are objectively valid.

<p>SUBJECTIVE: ... belonging to reality as perceived rather than as
independent of mind;... conditioned by personal mental characteristics
or states... arising out of or identified by means of one's perception
of one's own states and processes.. SUBJECTIVISM: a doctrine that the
supreme good is the realization of a subjective experience or
feeling... a doctrine that individual feeling is the ultimate criterion
of the good and the right.

<p>ABSOLUTE: characteristic of a ruler or authority completely free of
constitutional or other restraints... having no restriction, exception,
or qualification... being self-sufficient and free of external
references or relationships...

<p>RELATIVE: a thing having a relation or connection with or necessary
dependence on another thing... not absolute or independent...
RELATIVISM: (a) a theory that knowledge is relative to the limited
nature of the mind and the conditions of knowing... (b) a view that
ethical truths depend on the individuals and groups holding them.

<p>Notice that the two meanings of "relativism" differ in important ways.
The scientific method of seeking knowledge admits that its conclusions
are relative to, dependent on, the (objective) evidence gathered so
far, and may be changed by new evidence.&nbsp; In ethics, "relativism"
commonly refers to a particular view, "cultural relativism", that
ethics are a matter of (subjective) individual or majority opinion.
These are two different uses of the word, which must be kept distinct.

<p>"Objective" and "absolute" are not the same, "subjective" and
"relative" are not the same.&nbsp; Objective things can be relative,
subjective opinions can be held absolutely.&nbsp; Religious morality, for
some religions, may be "absolute" in the sense defined above- there is
really only one commandment, "Obey the will of God, as reported by the
priesthood." When a believer says that his morality is "absolute", it
means he is resolutely determined not to apply any of his own
intelligence to moral questions.&nbsp; When he says it is universal and
unchanging, it means his morality is indifferent to the consequences of
trying to follow it in the real world.&nbsp; He may also mean that he is
willing to apply whatever force may be necessary to make everyone else
bow down to his own chosen Lord.

<p>Is religious morality "objective"?&nbsp; In Protestant Christianity alone
there are thousands of denominations, with teachings that differ on
every moral issue.&nbsp; There are (regarding violence) pacifists and
imperialists; (regarding money) capitalists and communists,
millionaires and ascetics; (regarding sex) celibates, polygamists,
anti-birth-control activists, and gay churches.&nbsp; If the Bible is
supposed to give us "objective" moral standards, it seems to be very
easy to misinterpret.

<p>Religious morality is not "objective" because it depends crucially on
faith.&nbsp; It is not "perceptible to all observers".&nbsp; It requires a
revelation, or at least an alleged revelation.&nbsp; The messenger
proclaims the message, and the ordinary working stiffs who hear him
have to decide if this is a real prophet, or some con artist or
demagaogue who has plans to use them.&nbsp; After all, there is a different
alleged revelation down the block.&nbsp; Those of us who live many
centuries later have to hope the words of the prophets are reported
and translated accurately, for, as Jeremiah said, "actually the lying
pen of the scribes has handled it falsely".&nbsp; (Jer. 8:8)

<p>If someone calls you on the telephone and says they are working for a
good cause, what reason do you have to believe them?&nbsp; Last year
Americans were taken for $40 Billion dollars by fraudulent telephone
callers.&nbsp; If you know someone face to face in some OTHER way, and you
then recognize their voice over the phone, then you have reason to
trust what they say; but a stranger calling could be anyone.&nbsp; So, let
us assume that the Biblical prophets are honorable men; all, all
honorable men.&nbsp; A prophet hears a voice coming out of the air, out of
a burning bush, or whatever, and the voice says: "I am Yahveh, King
of the Universe.&nbsp; I am the Creator of all things." How do they know,
how CAN they know, whether this Yahveh character is telling the
truth?&nbsp; We don't even know if this is the real Yahveh, much less the
real Creator of the Universe.&nbsp; We don't know if it was the same voice
speaking to different prophets.&nbsp; The voice could be some imp or sprite
about three inches tall, playing a practical joke.&nbsp; It could be a
demon with darker plans.&nbsp; Is this Yahveh really the Creator of the
Universe, as he claims, or is he perhaps some local ghost?&nbsp; Perhaps
Yahveh is lying, as he has sometimes done.&nbsp; (1 Kings 22, 2 Chronicles
18, Ezekiel 14:9, 2 Thessolonians 2:11-12.) Perhaps Yahveh is giving
bad laws deliberately, as he boasted in Ezekiel 20:25.&nbsp; All this has
to be decided subjectively.

<p>Can secular philosophers offer an "objective" morality?&nbsp; I will outline
a case that (1) The basics of right and wrong are not relative to
culture, but are necessarily common to all human cultures; (2) Moral
precepts can be objectively valid, testable by scientific methods,
capable of confirmation (or disproof) by independent observers; (3)
While it is true that values are subjective- things have value because
people value them- and therefore the basics of good and evil are
relative to goals adopted voluntarily by individuals- everything good
is good TO somebody FOR something- nevertheless (4) There is a "default
goal" that would be "natural" to human beings, would be expected to be
attractive to the vast majority of the population, and provides our
intuitive feelings that certain things are "obviously" good or evil.

<p>Craig reportedly says that "Atheists say that human beings are just
animals, and animals don't have morality.&nbsp; Thus Atheists don't believe
in morality." Craig is misinformed; some animals are social animals,
who survive by cooperating in groups.&nbsp; Social animals have morality.&nbsp; See
THE BIOLOGY OF MORAL SYSTEMS by Richard Alexander and GOOD NATURED by
Frans De Waal.&nbsp; Morality serves the function of maintaining peaceful and
cooperative relations among group members.&nbsp; So, there will be some
basics that are universal to all groups.

<p>In THE ELEMENTS OF MORAL PHILOSOPHY, (an introductory textbook), James
Rachels writes (p. 129): "The key idea [of the social contract approach
to ethics] is that morally binding rules are the ones that are
necessary for social living.&nbsp; It is obvious... that we could not live
together very well if we did not accept rules prohibiting murder,
assault, theft, lying, breaking promises, and the like.&nbsp; These rules are
justified simply by showing that they are necessary if we are to
cooperate for our mutual benefit."

<p>Human beings are social animals; we have been living in groups for
longer than we have been human.&nbsp; We are more social than any other
species; the largest insect societies have a few million individuals,
humans cooperate in societies of hundreds of millions, even billions.
Humans are predisposed to learn morality in early childhood, in the
same way we are predisposed to learn language.&nbsp; See THE BRIGHTER SIDE OF
HUMAN NATURE by Alfie Kohn, and THE MORAL SENSE by James Q. Wilson.

<p>How is this social-contract type of morality "objective"?&nbsp; It is made
entirely of hypothetical oughts, of the form "If you want X, then you
ought to do Y".&nbsp; Hypothetical oughts describe a causal relation between
means and ends that is objectively true or false.&nbsp; An ethic made of
hypothetical oughts is called a "consequentialist" morality.&nbsp; There is
some desired goal specified; whether an action is right or wrong, good
or bad, is determined by the objective consequences of the act FOR the
ultimate goal of the ethic.&nbsp; In the case of social-contract morality,
"If you want to maintain peaceful and cooperative relations with your
neighbors, don't kill, steal, lie, or break agreements." As Shakespeare
wrote, "It needs no ghost, Milord, come from the grave, to tell us
this."

<p>Social-contract morality is the ethics of Peace.&nbsp; It can set the minimum
standards of right and wrong.&nbsp; But there are many different possible
ways a peaceful and cooperative society might function.&nbsp; Beyond the
ABC's of right and wrong described above, necessary to the cohesion and
cooperative functioning of any group, cultural relativism would seem to
be a serious contender.&nbsp; Is there any universal standard of
"desirability", that gives the ABC's of good and evil?&nbsp; Can we say that
some groups, some societies, are "better" than others?

<p>There is one standard that is favored by natural selection, and thus
would be expected to be used by the vast majority of people,
consciously or unconsciously.&nbsp; That is the ethics of Health.

<p>There is a built-in goal of biological life, genetic reproductive
success, also called "inclusive fitness" by biologists.&nbsp; For nonhuman
life, this goal could be described as "promote the health of your
family", where "health" is defined as "survival ability" and "family"
is "all who share your genes, to the degree that they share your
genes".&nbsp; Human beings are a special case in at least two ways.&nbsp; First,
our self-awareness and free will give us the ability to choose our
goals; inclusive fitness is only the "default option", toward which our
nature will incline us unless we consciously choose to pursue something
else.&nbsp; Second, humans are more than carriers of genes; we have original
thoughts, we create, receive, modify, and transmit culture.&nbsp; Therefore,
for human beings, "inclusive fitness" would as legitimately include our
cultural kin as our genetic kin.

<p>What is the purpose of nonhuman life?&nbsp; Reproductive success is the goal
that almost all living organisms pursue, because they follow their
internal urges uncritically.&nbsp; Their internal urges are shaped by natural
selection, and inclusive fitness is what natural selection selects for.
In short, the default goal of biological life is to raise kids; failing
that, help your kinfolk raise kids.

<p>What is the goal of human life?&nbsp; We have our choice on that.&nbsp; We can, and
do, override our internal urges by our will.&nbsp; Under the influence of
religion, we can talk ourselves into lifelong celibacy, even mass
suicide.&nbsp; We live and die for "causes" that care not whether we live or
die.&nbsp; Being intelligent and verbal, we can become distant from our
underlying biological nature.&nbsp; But most of us feel the pull of our
nature nonverbally.&nbsp; The goal that many people pursue unconsciously, and
which I advocate adopting consciously, is "promote the health of your
circle".&nbsp; The boundaries of your circle are your choice, but it would be
entirely natural to include yourself, your genetic kin and descendants,
your cultural kin and descendants.&nbsp; (There are no sharp natural
boundaries to kinship, either genetic or cultural, but near kin
commonly receive more concern than distant kin.) If you have no
personal interest in raising kids, or in helping your kinfolk raise
kids, then contribute something to the culture.

<p>Adopting this as your ultimate goal gives an ethic that is
consequentialist, objective, and Aristotelian.&nbsp; "Health", defined as
"survival ability", implies other derivative values.&nbsp; The more knowledge
you have, the more friends you have, the more freedom, the more wealth,
the more wisdom, other things being equal, the greater your ability to
survive, and promote the survival of your circle.

<p>By this standard, societies can be judged better or worse according to
whether they are a "healthy" place for your kin "unto all generations"
to live in.&nbsp; The ultimate goal of the ethics of Health is Sustainable
Civilization.&nbsp; Reading the history of life on Earth has impressed me
with the rarity and value of "the way we live now".&nbsp; For three billion
years the highest form of life was blue-green algae.&nbsp; For a million
years the human species made fire and stone tools, and lived by hunting
and gathering in small tribes.&nbsp; For ten thousand years most of us lived
by peasant agriculture, which is no fun.&nbsp; It would be a great tragedy if
our civilization crashed and burned a few hundred years after
discovering the scientific method.&nbsp; I would like to see a civilization
based on reason and freedom last for geological ages.

<p>If our civilization is to be long-lived, we must face the challenge
of sustainability- stabilizing our population, establishing a long-
lived peace, developing forms of industry that do not poison our water
and air, forms of agriculture that do not create deserts, energy
sources that will supply us for millennia.&nbsp; For our long-term health, we
will also want to develop the ability to alter the orbits of the apollo
asteroids, whose orbits cross the orbit of Earth.&nbsp; Colonizing the solar
system would not be a bad idea, either.

<p>Fairy-tales about the supernatural are not necessary to give meaning or
purpose to life.&nbsp; Instead of seeking a ticket to Heaven by being an
obedient slave on Earth, we can gain meaning by taking a positive role
in history, seeking to make this Earth a better place.
