<h3 align=center>Benedict issues statement asserting that Jesus established "only one church"</h3>
<p>LORENZAGO DI CADORE, Italy - Pope Benedict XVI has reasserted the universal
primacy of the Roman Catholic Church, approving a document released Tuesday that says Orthodox
churches were defective and that other Christian denominations were not true churches. 
<p>Benedict approved a document from his old offices at the Congregation for the Doctrine of
the Faith that restates church teaching on relations with other Christians. It was the
second time in a week the pope has corrected what he says are erroneous interpretations of
the Second Vatican Council, the 1962-65 meetings that modernized the church.
<p>On Saturday, Benedict revisited another key aspect of Vatican II by reviving the old Latin Mass.
Traditional Catholics cheered the move, but more liberal ones called it a step back from Vatican II.
<p>Benedict, who attended Vatican II as a young theologian, has long complained about what he
considers the erroneous interpretation of the council by liberals, saying it was not a break
from the past but rather a renewal of church tradition.
<p>In the latest document ”formulated as five questions and answers” the Vatican seeks to set
the record straight on Vatican II™s ecumenical intent, saying some contemporary theological
interpretation had been "erroneous or ambiguous" and had prompted confusion and doubt.
<p>It restates key sections of a 2000 document the pope wrote when he was prefect of the
congregation, "Dominus Iesus," which set off a firestorm of criticism among Protestant and
other Christian denominations because it said they were not true churches but merely ecclesial
communities and therefore did not have the "means of salvation."
<p>In the new document and an accompanying commentary, which were released as the pope
vacations here in Italy's Dolomite mountains, the Vatican repeated that position.
<p>"Christ "established here on earth" only one church," the document said. The other
communities "cannot be called "churches" in the proper sense" because they do not have apostolic
succession "” the ability to trace their bishops back to Christ's original apostles.
<p><b>"Identity of the Catholic faith"</b><br>
The Rev. Sara MacVane of the Anglican Centre in Rome, said there was nothing new in the document.
<p>"I don't know what motivated it at this time," she said. "But it's important always to
point out that there's the official position and there's the huge amount of friendship and
fellowship and worshipping together that goes on at all levels, certainly between Anglican and
Catholics and all the other groups and Catholics."
<p>The document said Orthodox churches were indeed "churches" because they have apostolic
succession and that they enjoyed "many elements of sanctification and of truth." But it said
they lack something because they do not recognize the primacy of the pope a defect, or a "wound" that harmed them, it said.
<p>"This is obviously not compatible with the doctrine of primacy which, according to the
Catholic faith, is an "internal constitutive principle" of the very existence of a particular
church," the commentary said.
<p>Despite the harsh tone of the document, it
stresses that Benedict remains committed to
ecumenical dialogue.
<p>"However, if such dialogue is to be truly
constructive, it must involve not just the
mutual openness of the participants but also
fidelity to the identity of the Catholic faith,"
the commentary said.
<p><b>"Not backtracking on ecumenical commitment"</b><br>
The document, signed by the
congregation prefect, U.S. Cardinal William
Levada, was approved by Benedict on June 29, the
feast of Sts. Peter and Paul, a major
ecumenical feast day. 
<p>There was no indication about why the pope
felt it necessary to release the document,
particularly since his 2000 document summed up
the same principles. Some analysts suggested it
could be a question of internal church politics,
or that it could simply be an indication of
Benedict using his office as pope to again
stress key doctrinal issues from his time at the
congregation.
<p>Father Augustine Di Noia, undersecretary for
the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith,
said the document did not alter the commitment
for ecumenical dialogue, but aimed to assert
Catholic identity in those talks. 
<p>"The Church is not backtracking on ecumenical
commitment," Di Noia told Vatican radio. 
<p>"But, as you know, it is fundamental to any
kind of dialogue that the participants are clear
about their own identity. That is, dialogue
cannot be an occasion to accommodate or soften
what you actually understand yourself to be."
