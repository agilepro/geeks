<h2>Excerpt: Muslim Academic Questions Muhammad's Existence</h2>
<i>Below are translated excerpts from an article in
German entitled, "Islamic Theology Without the Historic
Muhammad -- Comments on the Challenges of the
Historical-Critical Method for Islamic Thinking," by
Germany's Prof. Muhammad Kalisch, a Muslim. (<a href="NoMuhammad.htm">See related article</a>.)</i><p>

<p>Up to some time ago I was convinced that Muhammad was
a historical figure. Although I always based my thinking
on the assumption that the Islamic historical narrative
regarding Muhammad was very unreliable, I had no doubts
that at least the basic lines of his biography were
historically correct.
<p>I have now moved away from this position and will
soon publish a book in which I will, among other things,
comment on this question and explain my arguments in
more detail. This essay is only a short summary of my
most important arguments. It also deals with the
question of what implications historical-critical
research has for the Islamic theory and how I deal with
my research results as a theologian.
<p>With regard to the historical existence of Muhammad
... I consider my position simply as a continuation of
the most recent research results. It appears so
spectacular only because it has been said by a Muslim
... Most Western scientists turn down such an hypotheses
out of respect for Islam or because they are afraid of
the reactions of their Muslim friends or because they
think it is speculative nonsense.
<p>The word "respect" sounds wonderful but it is
completely inappropriate here because one really refers
to the opposite. Whoever thinks that Muslims can't deal
with facts puts Muslims on the same level as small
children who can't think and decide for themselves and
whose illusions of Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny one
doesn't want to destroy.
<p>Whoever really bases his thoughts on the equality of
all human beings must expect the same intellectual
performance. Really treating Muslims with respect would
imply that they are strong enough to deal with their
religion on the basis of our modern level of knowledge.
"Islamophobes" think we Muslims are barbarians, the
"kind-hearted" take us for "noble savages"... The result
is the same: Muslims are seen as different from the rest
of the world -- they either belong in a "petting zoo" or
in cages for wild animals, but by all means they belong
in a zoo.
<p>The final argument is even more awful because it can
only be described as cowardly. Religious fundamentalists
are spreading out (not only Islamic fundamentalist) and
freedom of thought must be defended no matter what.
There must not be any compromise on this otherwise we
set the track for a retreat into the Middle Ages and
this can happen much faster than many people think.
<p>My position with regard to the historical existence
of Muhammad is that I believe neither his existence nor
his non-existence can be proven. I, however, lean
towards the non-existence but I don't think it can be
proven. It is my impression that, unless there are some
sensational archeological discoveries -- an Islamic
"Qumran" or "Nag Hammadi" -- the question of Muhammad's
existence will probably never be finally clarified.<p>* * *<p>Click<a class target="_blank"
