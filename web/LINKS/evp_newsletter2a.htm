<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>The
purpose of these newsletters is to report on the debate on the EVP and related
topics, and invite comment. When an engineer points out that the philosophy of
ethics can have an elegant analytic solution attended by a rigorous proof, he
must expect opposition, even disdain. (See </font><a href="http://64.4.16.250/cgi-bin/linkrd?_lang=EN&amp;lah=bfb416a818a7f72185eaacf65fdc2838&amp;lat=1071708634&amp;hm___action=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2ewoodhillpublishing%2eco%2euk%2f" target="_blank"><font face="Times New Roman" size=3 target="_blank">www.woodhillpublishing.co.uk</font></a><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>
for a summary of the EVP.) In the event, I have enjoyed discussion with a number
of courteous and intelligent commentators, a majority of whom have felt opposed
to the EVP, but none of whom have been able to fault its proof. Yet, if the EVP
were correct, it would seem to be too useful to ignore. That is why I must (with
apologies) continue to trouble people with the subject until that refutation is
achieved!</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>I
am reminded of the words of Kent van Cleave: “I hope you'll do your best to
challenge my views and grind them into the dirt. <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Am
I <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">nuts</i>? No, I'm a philosopher.</b>
I'm not interested in convincing people to adopt views that are erroneous! If

The sooner I correct my errors, the sooner I can be <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">right</i></b>

I realize, after some pleasant but inconclusive correspondence, that most who
have offered views are not discussing my work. Instead they are challenging the
starting points on which it is built. Some of these fundamentals, which I have
long regarded as uncontroversial, are:</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Three
Fundamentals<O:P>
</O:P>
</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>1)
The non-living universe just exists. It shows correlations that we call natural
laws, but it gives no evidence of purpose. In the words of Richard Dawkins,
“the universe we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if
there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil and no good, nothing but
blind pitiless indifference”.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>2)
All of the astonishing complexity of living things is the result of natural
selection acting on replicating molecules, without supernatural help. Living
things show apparent purpose in a way that the non-living universe does not
(lungs are for oxygen absorption, legs are for locomotion etc.). It is easy to
understand why this is a consequence of natural selection.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>3)
All human and animal mental function is the product of electrochemical reactions
in the nerve cells of the brain. This applies without exception to human
consciousness, free will, memory, and moral sentiments; in fact, to every
product of the human emotions and intellect.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;<O:P>
</O:P>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>I
do not feel that I should spend too much time defending these three statements.
People abler than myself have already supplied overwhelming evidence and it is
there for anyone to see. Many people (indeed the majority) reject these ideas,
but they do so for reasons other than evidence. If you feel unwilling to accept
them, I respect your right to do so, but perhaps you may best choose to press
the delete button now!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;<O:P>
</O:P>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>For
those of us with a stomach for the truth, however, there are important rewards.
It is a consequence of 2) above that we can begin to understand our creator. We
have been created by a simple and mathematically definable mechanism, which,
despite the astonishing complexity of its products, offers opportunities for
discovery both by deduction and by observation. It is certainly easier to
understand than the mind of a god, whose only consistent policy, if he exists,
seems to be an obsessive desire for self-concealment.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;<O:P>
</O:P>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Despite
its obvious consequences for philosophy, it is astonishing that most
philosophers ignore evolution. John Harris is a contemporary philosopher with
whom I have corresponded recently. His work is impressive, yet, in his otherwise
excellent <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">The Value of Life,</i> he
dismisses natural selection with the words: “...one could hardly describe the
survival of the fittest and its corollary, the destruction of the weakest, as a
humane (albeit human) arrangement.”</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;<O:P>
</O:P>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Of
course he leaves unanswered the question “but why should I want to be
humane?” Some might say, if you need to ask that question, then you are just a
bad person – an answer good enough for everyday life perhaps, but not for
philosophy.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;<O:P>
</O:P>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>The
correct answer, at the level of fact, is that I want to be humane because that
is how I have been created by natural selection. Human beings are genetically
programmed to have a complex system of goals, both for self-interest and moral
sentiments towards others. They also have instincts to co-ordinate these goals
with others in their society and to negotiate reciprocation of morality. This
system constitutes a huge body of information, a complex mechanism that has not
arisen by chance out of thin air. Natural selection is its only possible source.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;<O:P>
</O:P>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>It
frustrates me that supposedly intelligent and well read people naively dismiss
evolution as being “red in tooth and claw” when in reality our evolution as
a social species is our most important behavioural characteristic. It is not our
physical strength, but our ability to co-operate that has made us the dominant
species on earth. It only takes a moment’s reflection to understand that, at
any time during the last million years, an individual with completely unethical
behaviour would suffer a reduction in inclusive fitness.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;<O:P>
</O:P>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>The
prisoners’ dilemma problem gives precision to what we already know. If we can
co-operate and find ways to prevent cheating, then we can all be better off. Any
animal that develops enough intelligence, memory and communication skill will
evolve a system of co-operation and morality to exploit this very valuable
resource. This is a function of information-processing ability only. Even if
that developed on another planet, an ethical system would inevitably evolve.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;<O:P>
</O:P>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>This
seems to be what many people find difficult to understand about the EVP. Our
values must have an information source and the only available source is natural
selection interacting with chance events; there is no other information input.
We have the conclusion that we must choose natural selection or randomness as
the basis of our values. A decision to reject randomness as a valid source can
only be made as a subjective decision of our brains (which are, of course, the
product of natural selection). The elegance of this realization is that we have
a defined basis of mathematical precision on which further work can build.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;<O:P>
</O:P>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Yet
many people, following their evolved instincts to raise the standard of morality
in their societies, say that we should rise above our base instincts installed
by nature. Yet where does the information come from to specify what we should do
differently? If we should rise, which way is up? There is no source for this
information.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;<O:P>
</O:P>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Of
course we have seen an improvement in morality over time and some have tried to
“explain” this by calling it an “emergent” property of society. But that
is unnecessary mysticism. Morality has always been a good strategy for its
participants and advances have been achieved by improvements in communications
and social structures. It is the quality of our co-operative mechanisms that has
changed, not the underlying values that they serve.</font></p>
