<h1>Pope Admits: 'God Ain't Said Shit To Me'</h1>
<p>VATICAN CITYâ€”Pope John Paul II, elected by his peers to serve as the
earthly vicar of Christ, told an interviewer Monday that in the 18 years since
his canonization God has not spoken a word to him.

<p>"You know what? God ain't said shit to me. Ever," the Pope told <i>Il
Figaro </i>reporter Giuseppe Mazzoli. "Not one lousy word. Seventy-six
years I'm bustin' my hump for this mysterious Divine One, and still it's like,
'John Paul who?' Christ."
<p>"Just last week," the Pope continued, "I underwent a difficult
appendectomy. You'd certainly think the Lord would call to wish me well, right?
He didn't so much as send a card. What a dick."
<p>In the interview, a discussion of the changing face of Catholicism on the eve
of the 21st century, the Pope said, "It appears that as God guides us
through this modern era, more difficult questions arise... questions requiring
more complex answers. But then again, why the hell should I even bother looking
for the answers when the guy hasn't said one word to me?"
<p>According to Mazzoli, when he asked the Pope if he believed the Lord is in us
all, he "opened his mouth as if about to answer, then furrowed his brow in
deep thought and suddenly blurted out, 'You know what, Mazzoli? Don't even talk
to me about God. I don't want to hear it.'"
<p>The Pope then threw a chair across the room and stormed off.<p>

<p>Despite his current frustrations with God, the Pope has no intention of
stepping down from his position as leader of the world's approximately one
billion Catholics.
<p>"No way," said the Pope, who lives in a cathedral and is doted on
by an army of servants who attend to his every need. "This is sweet
living."
<p>The Pope is served three gourmet meals a day, each served on priceless,
solid-silver dinnerware hand-made by Michelangelo in 1537. He enjoys a
nine-foot-wide, Turkish-style marble bath with solid gold fixtures that flow
with pure spring water imported from the Italian mountains.
<p>"God, I can live without, but I ain't giving up this gig for
nothing," the Pope said in an official Church decree. "I got it made
here."
<p>The Pope does almost no work throughout the day, but on a whim he can demand
private audiences with heads of state and religious leaders all over the world,
all of whom kiss his hand in a symbolic show of respect and listen carefully to
his every word.
<p>"I suppose I'm supposed to be reflecting and shit," the Pope said.
"And I guess I am reflecting. I'm reflecting on how fucking awesome my life is."
<p>The Pope has cancelled his upcoming three-week visit to Central and South
America in order to roll around naked in a giant pile of Spanish doubloons.
