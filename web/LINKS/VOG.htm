From <a href=http://www.theonion.com/index/4149>TheOnion Issue 41•49</a><h2>Voice Of God Revealed To Be Cheney On Intercom</h2>
December 7, 2005<p>WASHINGTON, DC — Telephone logs recorded by the National
Security Agency and obtained by Congress as part of an ongoing
investigation suggest that the vice president may have used the
Oval Office intercom system to address President Bush at crucial
moments, giving categorical directives in a voice the president
believed to be that of God.</p>

President Bush sits at his desk in the Oval Office, where he received messages from an intercom
voice identifying itself as "God" and thought to have been Vice President Cheney (below).</tbody></table>
<p>While journalists and presidential historians had long noted
Bush's deep faith and Cheney's powerful influence in the White
House, few had drawn a direct correlation between the two until
Tuesday, when transcripts of meetings that took place in March
and April of 2002 became available.
<p>In a transcript of an intercom exchange recorded in March
2002, a voice positively identified as the vice president's
identifies himself as "the Lord thy God" and promotes the
invasion of Iraq, as well as the use of torture in prisoner
interrogations.
<p>A close examination of Bush's public statements and Secret
Service time logs tracking the vice president reveals a
consistent pattern, one which links Bush's belief that he had
received word from God with Cheney's use of the White House's
telephone-based intercom system.
<p>Officials privately acknowledged that there is reason to
believe that the vice president, as God, urged Bush to sign
legislation benefiting oil companies in 2005.
<p>"There's a lot of religious zeal in the West Wing," said a
former White House staffer who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. "It's possible that the vice president has taken
advantage of that to fast-track certain administration
objectives."
<p>An ex-Treasury Department official and longtime friend of
Cheney was asked to comment on the vice president's possible
subterfuge. "I don't know. I certainly don't think it's
something [Cheney] planned," he said. "I do know that Mr. Bush
was unfamiliar with a phone-based intercom, and I suppose it is
possible that Dick took advantage of that."
<p>A highly placed NSA official who has reviewed the information
released Tuesday said Cheney masked his clipped monotone,
employing a deeper, booming voice.</p>

<p>Said the NSA source: "It sounded as though the speaker, who
identified himself as God, stood away from the intercom to
create an echo effect."
<p>On Capitol Hill, sources are expressing surprise that Cheney,
a vice president with more influence than any other in U.S.
history, would have resorted to such deception.
<p>"The vice president has a lot of sway in this
administration," said a former White House aide. "But perhaps
when President Bush was particularly resolute and resistant to
mortal persuasion, the vice president chose to quickly resolve
disputes in his favor with a half-decent God impression."
<p>For many, the revelation explains Bush's confusion in the
wake of Hurricane Katrina.
<p>"I was very surprised by the president's slow response in New
Orleans," political commentator Bill Kristol said. "The
president told me that he was praying every day in his office,
but had received no reply. I had no idea what he meant, but of
course, it all makes sense now."
<p>At the time of Katrina, Cheney was on a fly-fishing trip,
from which he returned on Sept. 1.
<p>According to highly placed White House sources, Bush's senior
advisers are trying to shield the president from the news. Aides
are concerned that too harsh an awakening might shake Bush's
faith, which has been a central part of his life for nearly 20 years.
<p>"It's hard to tell the leader of the free world that he has
been the butt of an elaborate and long-term ruse," a former
staffer said. "Maybe it would be easier to take if it came from
Cheney's God voice."<p><hr><h3 align=center>&raquo; <a href=Humor.html>go to Atheists of Silicon Valley Humor Page</a> &laquo;<p>
