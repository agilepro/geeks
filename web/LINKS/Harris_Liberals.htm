<h3>Western civilization really is at risk from Muslim extremists.</h3>By Sam Harris<p>
<a href=http://www.samharris.org>SAM HARRIS</a> is the author of &quot;The End of Faith:
Religion, Terror and the Future of Reason.&quot; His next book, &quot;Letter
to a Christian Nation,&quot; will be published this week by Knopf.<p>
September 18, 2006<p>
TWO YEARS AGO I published a book highly critical of religion, &quot;The
End of Faith.&quot; In it, I argued that the world's major religions are
genuinely incompatible, inevitably cause conflict and now prevent
the emergence of a viable, global civilization. In response, I have
received many thousands of letters and e-mails from priests,
journalists, scientists, politicians, soldiers, rabbis, actors, aid
workers, students — from people young and old who occupy every point
on the spectrum of belief and nonbelief.<p>
This has offered me a special opportunity to see how people of all
creeds and political persuasions react when religion is criticized.
I am here to report that liberals and conservatives respond very
differently to the notion that religion can be a direct cause of
human conflict.<p>
This difference does not bode well for the future of liberalism.<p>
Perhaps I should establish my liberal bone fides at the
outset. I'd like to see taxes raised on the wealthy,
drugs decriminalized and homosexuals free to marry. I
also think that the Bush administration deserves most of
the criticism it has received in the last six years —
especially with respect to its waging of the war in
Iraq, its scuttling of science and its fiscal
irresponsibility.<p>
But my correspondence with liberals has convinced me
that liberalism has grown dangerously out of touch with
the realities of our world — specifically with what
devout Muslims actually believe about the West, about
paradise and about the ultimate ascendance of their
faith.<p>
On questions of national security, I am now as wary of
my fellow liberals as I am of the religious demagogues
on the Christian right.<p>
This may seem like frank acquiescence to the charge that
&quot;liberals are soft on terrorism.&quot; It is, and they are.<p>
A cult of death is forming in the Muslim world — for
reasons that are perfectly explicable in terms of the
Islamic doctrines of martyrdom and jihad. The truth is
that we are not fighting a &quot;war on terror.&quot; We are
fighting a pestilential theology and a longing for
paradise.<p>
This is not to say that we are at war with all Muslims.
But we are absolutely at war with those who believe that
death in defense of the faith is the highest possible
good, that cartoonists should be killed for caricaturing
the prophet and that any Muslim who loses his faith
should be butchered for apostasy.<p>
Unfortunately, such religious extremism is not as fringe
a phenomenon as we might hope. Numerous studies have
found that the most radicalized Muslims tend to have
better-than-average educations and economic
opportunities.<p>
Given the degree to which religious ideas are still
sheltered from criticism in every society, it is
actually possible for a person to have the economic and
intellectual resources to build a nuclear bomb — and to
believe that he will get 72 virgins in paradise. And
yet, despite abundant evidence to the contrary, liberals
continue to imagine that Muslim terrorism springs from
economic despair, lack of education and American
militarism.<p>
At its most extreme, liberal denial has found expression
in a growing subculture of conspiracy theorists who
believe that the atrocities of 9/11 were orchestrated by
our own government. A nationwide poll conducted by the
Scripps Survey Research Center at Ohio University found
that more than a third of Americans suspect that the
federal government &quot;assisted in the 9/11 terrorist
attacks or took no action to stop them so the United
States could go to war in the Middle East;&quot; 16% believe
that the twin towers collapsed not because fully-fueled
passenger jets smashed into them but because agents of
the Bush administration had secretly rigged them to
explode.<p>
Such an astonishing eruption of masochistic unreason
could well mark the decline of liberalism, if not the
decline of Western civilization. There are books, films
and conferences organized around this phantasmagoria,
and they offer an unusually clear view of the
debilitating dogma that lurks at the heart of
liberalism: Western power is utterly malevolent, while
the powerless people of the Earth can be counted on to
embrace reason and tolerance, if only given sufficient
economic opportunities.<p>
I don't know how many more engineers and architects need
to blow themselves up, fly planes into buildings or saw
the heads off of journalists before this fantasy will
dissipate. The truth is that there is every reason to
believe that a terrifying number of the world's Muslims
now view all political and moral questions in terms of
their affiliation with Islam. This leads them to rally
to the cause of other Muslims no matter how sociopathic
their behavior. This benighted religious solidarity may
be the greatest problem facing civilization and yet it
is regularly misconstrued, ignored or obfuscated by
liberals.<p>
Given the mendacity and shocking incompetence of the
Bush administration — especially its mishandling of the
war in Iraq — liberals can find much to lament in the
conservative approach to fighting the war on terror.
Unfortunately, liberals hate the current administration
with such fury that they regularly fail to acknowledge
just how dangerous and depraved our enemies in the
Muslim world are.<p>
Recent condemnations of the Bush administration's use of
the phrase &quot;Islamic fascism&quot; are a case in point. There
is no question that the phrase is imprecise — Islamists
are not technically fascists, and the term ignores a
variety of schisms that exist even among Islamists — but
it is by no means an example of wartime propaganda, as
has been repeatedly alleged by liberals.<p>
In their analyses of U.S. and Israeli foreign policy,
liberals can be relied on to overlook the most basic
moral distinctions. For instance, they ignore the fact
that Muslims intentionally murder noncombatants, while
we and the Israelis (as a rule) seek to avoid doing so.
Muslims routinely use human shields, and this accounts
for much of the collateral damage we and the Israelis
cause; the political discourse throughout much of the
Muslim world, especially with respect to Jews, is
explicitly and unabashedly genocidal.<p>
Given these distinctions, there is no question that the
Israelis now hold the moral high ground in their
conflict with Hamas and Hezbollah. And yet liberals in
the United States and Europe often speak as though the
truth were otherwise.<p>
We are entering an age of unchecked nuclear
proliferation and, it seems likely, nuclear terrorism.
There is, therefore, no future in which aspiring martyrs
will make good neighbors for us. Unless liberals realize
that there are tens of millions of people in the Muslim
world who are far scarier than Dick Cheney, they will be
unable to protect civilization from its genuine enemies.<p>
Increasingly, Americans will come to believe that the
only people hard-headed enough to fight the religious
lunatics of the Muslim world are the religious lunatics
of the West. Indeed, it is telling that the people who
speak with the greatest moral clarity about the current
wars in the Middle East are members of the Christian
right, whose infatuation with biblical prophecy is
nearly as troubling as the ideology of our enemies.
Religious dogmatism is now playing both sides of the
board in a very dangerous game.<p>
While liberals should be the ones pointing the way
beyond this Iron Age madness, they are rendering
themselves increasingly irrelevant. Being generally
reasonable and tolerant of diversity, liberals should be
especially sensitive to the dangers of religious
literalism. But they aren't.<p>
The same failure of liberalism is evident in Western
Europe, where the dogma of multiculturalism has left a
secular Europe very slow to address the looming problem
of religious extremism among its immigrants. The people
who speak most sensibly about the threat that Islam
poses to Europe are actually fascists.<p>
To say that this does not bode well for liberalism is an understatement: It does not bode well for the future of civilization.
