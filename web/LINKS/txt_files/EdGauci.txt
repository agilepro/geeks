Hi Ed,

Thanks again for looking into this.  The problem seems simple; either we name directors in the articles of incorporation, or we have the person filing sign the document.  I agree that the articles should name the initial directors (e.g. the current board), then we just have each of us sign it.  This is the most egalitarian.  It seems to be just a title change from "officers" to "directors".  I expect that all 5 of the board will be at the next meeting on the 26th.

My only remaining concern is this line at the end of the ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION: "As stated in the Bylaws of this corporation."

What the heck are our bylaws?

godlessly,
Mark

>initial directors are not named in the articles, the articles shall
