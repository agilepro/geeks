Hi Reginald,

Welcome to California.

Several months ago I discovered a thread on the Internet Infidels that discussed many Atheists' experiences of theists' proofs of godâ€™s existence.  I collected and edited them, then posted them in the humor section of the website for Atheists of Silicon Valley: http://www.godlessgeeks.com

Evidently this has acquired a life of its own, and you wound up doing a show on it.  Thank you for letting other people hear some of them.  The problem with satire is that sometimes people may not understand that it's humor.  You started your show implying that you weren't sure if the list is real, so I thought that you should know its origins.

You implied that there were some more proofs that people sent in.  If you could send me those additional proofs, I'd love to add them to the list at godlessgeeks.

BTW, we met at GAMOW.  Here's a pic of my sweetheart Lydia and me:

This pic was also used on Bill Moyer's PBS show NOW a couple of weeks ago, when they had a discussion about god.

Thanks for pushing rational thought.  (What a concept!)

godlessly,
Mark Thomas
