Hi Bjorne,

We are looking for a few good people to help Atheists of Silicon Valley become even better.  Your name came up as the person that we think would be best.  Would you be interested in joining our board?  Right now, we are looking for a membership chairperson, but you could take on take any new position you might want to create.  ASV Science Outreach Coordinator is good, and we're looking for someone to help take the group to greater heights.

godlessly,
Mark
