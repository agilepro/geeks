Matthew 12:40
For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.  (Friday night, Saturday night, ???)

Isaiah 40:28 says, "...the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is he weary?" If this is true, why did God rest on the seventh day?

How did Jesus ascend to Heaven in the Flesh when Paul says that flesh cannot inherit the kingdom of Heaven? (1 Cor.15:50)

If God was Jesus' father (not Joseph), then why is Jesus' family tree traced through Joseph?

Christ said, in Matthew 10:34. "Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.

(36) And a man's foes shall be they of his own household."

Then Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, “One thing you lack: Go your way, sell whatever you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, take up the cross and follow Me.” 

NOTE: Jesus obviously hadn't been crucified yet, so the cross metaphor is not applicable.
