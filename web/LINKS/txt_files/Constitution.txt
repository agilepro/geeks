I am very interested in where you find any reference to a god or creator in the U.S. Constitution.  A creator god IS mentioned in the Declaration of Independence, but they were referring to a deistic god, which is very different from the Christian god.  In addition, the Declaration of Independence is not a legal document, and has no bearing on our government.
