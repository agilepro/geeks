You are a sick man who wishes harm to others who have done nothing to you.  History is full of such men who wanted to kill others simply because the others had broken their god's rules.  Luckily most of them were unable to actively fulfill their evil thoughts.  Hitler (a Christian) was one who was able to act on his desires.  Some of the most vile inflictions of pain from one human to another have occurred because of religion.

Because of people like you, science and medicine were held back from making our lives better.  If you don't think science and medicine are useful, I suggest considering what your life would be like without them.  Life for people used to be short, brutal, and painfull -- until we gained from the materialistic insights of modern science and medicine.  If you disagree, I suggest that you try living without them.

You say that your god rewards the just and the unjust.  Then, why do bad things happen to good people?  I'm sure that there were many who died in the WTC that both of us would classify as basically good people.  You will probably just give the standard cop-outs: 1) god works in mysterious ways, or 2) the good get their rewards in heaven.  Both responses have no empirical evidence to support them, just like religions.

I repeat, would you feel the same if there were someone you loved or cared about who had died on 9/11?  Would you feel the same if you were a likely next target?  I doubt if you have the capacity to imagine this, because it comes from empathy, a basic human characteristic that you seem to be lacking.

I distrust those people who know so well what God wants them to do 
because I notice it always coincides with their own desires.
