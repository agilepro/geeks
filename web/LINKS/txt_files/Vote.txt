Hello,

NOTE: >> Please respond by Wednesday evening. <<

So far, by scanning the msgs, I have tallied 21 votes on this issue, 17 yes (some a strong yes), and 4 no.  The dissenting votes are obviously the most problematic.  We don't need ASV fractured, so I am sending this out to you four who have voted no, so that I can get some better feedback and we can (hopefully) make a decision as a group.  I have contacted Planned Parenthood, and they would have no problem with our endorsement.

Here are some insights from Carl Sagan and his wife Ann Druyan on this issue.

Calling a single fertilized human egg a human being is done from a religious viewpoint, because of a purported soul that exists at the moment of fertilization.  No one could call it human by simply looking at it.  Thus I think that this issue is within our realm of separation of church and state.

We as morally influenced sentient beings (and our governments) must make a decision as to which has more rights, the developing cell/blastocyst/embryo/fetus or the woman.  If the cell/fetus has more rights, the woman's right to abortion should be prohibited.  If the woman has more rights, abortion must be available.  This obviously can be a gray area and a slippery slope.

This balancing act can be seen as boiling down to a simple question, "What do we call human?"  Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan concluded that it is our brains.  For a developing fetus, the brain is fairly ill-formed and non-functional until the 6th month of gestation.  They decided that this is an appropriate time for the scale to tip from the woman's rights to the rights of the developing fetus.  This is also coincidentally what the Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade.  For the first six months (the first two trimesters), the states cannot limit a woman's right to abortion.

As for "partial-birth abortions," which can take place in the last trimester, I'm fairly sure that most or all of us have strong concerns and find it troubling.  Many people think that a reasonable compromise would be to prohibit it, except when needed to save the life of the mother.  From what I can see, the Republicans are against this compormise and would prohibit late term abortions even if they are to save the mother's life or if the fetus is hopelessly deformed.

Since you have said that you are against our endorsing the Planned Parenthood ad, I am interested in more of your reasons and feelings.  As I stated, we don't need ASV fractured.  At this point, I am not interested in creating an ad hoc group such as Atheists of Silicon Valley for Choice.  I think that we should stand together and support a large majority, even if we can't totally agree.  However, if your sentiments are strong enough against ASV supporting the ad, the ad hoc group may be a solution.

Here are some questions that have come up:
  Are you dead-set against the announcement?  If so, do you think that you would have problems if the group endorsed the ad?
  Do you think that it is outside our charter as an Atheist org?
  Are you worried about offending pro-life Atheists, or do you personally have a problem with it?
  Would you think that endorsing the announcement is correct if no one else objects?
  Is there something else that I have not thought of?

Please respond by Wednesday evening.  Thank you.

godlessly,
Mark
