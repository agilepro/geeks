Hi Joe,

Would you be interested in writing and sending a news release about our May 1st protest?

I will think of some quotes for you to use, and I'm sure that you will have some good ideas too.

Below is one done by the Alabama State Director for AMERICAN ATHEISTS.

godlessly,
Mark

      ATHEISTS TO READ BIBLE AND PROTEST GROWING THEOCRACY
 
Atheists and other supporters of the constitutional principle of 
separation between religion and government will peaceably assemble in front of the State Judicial Building, 300 Dexter Avenue, Montgomery, AL next Thursday, May 1, beginning at 10:30 a.m.
 
This demonstration coincides with the National Day of Prayer and will 
be a forum for Atheists in Alabama to speak out against what they perceive as a growing theocracy in Alabama.  Passages from the Bible will also be read aloud, but there will be no prayer.
 
Alabama State Director Larry Darby cited several examples of 
politicians using the power and prestige of their offices to promote Christianity to the exclusion of non-Christian religions and Atheism.  These include:
 
     •    Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore's placement of a pulpit-
shaped, pulpit-size
     monument of a version of the Ten Commandments in the State 
Judicial Building
     •    Governor Bob Riley's incessant Christian proselytization 
and Bible studies
     conducted in the taxpayer-owned Capitol
     •    Alabama HB 403 and SB56, which would provide for the Ten 
Commandments to
     be displayed in government schools and other taxpayer-owned 
buildings
     •    Alabama HB262 and SB222, which would exempt clergy from 
reporting
     knowledge of child rape if knowledge of such is obtained via 
confession
 

Darby said, "For all practical purposes, government officials treat 
Atheists and those who profess non-Christian religions as if they are second-class citizens."
 
Darby added that Atheists will also be demonstrating support for 
U.S.D.C. Judge Myron Thompson and his decision ordering Chief Justice Moore to remove the Ten Commandments monument from the State Judicial Building.
 
AMERICAN ATHEISTS is a nationwide movement that defends civil rights 
for nonbelievers, works for the total separation of church and state, and addresses issues of First Amendment public policy.
