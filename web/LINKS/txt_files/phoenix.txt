Hi phoenix,

I define God to be my dog.  He exists, therefore God exists.

I define God to be love.  Love exists, therefore God exists.

Unfortunately, this has little or nothing to do with what most people think of as God.


Take care,
Mark

that's mildly insightful: hence the name "ontological argument reloaded" and
not "ontological argument".

Hi phoenix,

You obviously haven't bothered to read my talk on Atheism at http://www.godlessgeeks.com/WhyAtheism.htm

I posit that belief in an imaginary being is illogical and delusional.  I posit that there is no proof for any god.  Therefore all gods are imaginary, and people who believe in a god are at least partially illogical and delusional.  If there really were a Christian god, the evidence should be there.  Not only is there no empirical evidence for a god, there is no reliable, empirical, historical evidence that Jesus ever really existed.  This makes Jesus just a popular myth.

As for people who don't (or didn't) believe in a god, see http://www.celebatheists.com/ and http://www.visi.com/~markg/atheists.html

 - Mark

the logic failed because the humor succeeded.  it was a joke.  does anyone
who's not insane actually believe that no known correct proof of God
logically entails that God does not exist?
