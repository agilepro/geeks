Hi ,

You can see our schedule at www.godlessgeeks.com on the Events page. 

You can also sign up for our Yahoo email server, to get automatic notices and/or join the discussions.  We're just a bunch of Atheists who like to get together and talk, learn, do a few protests, and enjoy ourselves.  I hope that you can join us sometime, if you are interested.


godlessly,
Mark Thomas
