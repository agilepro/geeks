Hello Roger,

You, sir, have lost your humanity.  Would you feel the same if it were someone you loved or cared about who had died on 9/11?  Would you feel the same if you were a likely next target?

Your position is immoral.  'Punishing' someone for the crimes of another has no moral basis, other than in Christianity -- where Christ's supposed sacrifice is considered laudable.

Your god is immoral.  In your myths, he created the earth, then got mad at some of his people.  So, he killed almost everyone and everything on the planet.  In other stories, his followers often killed everyone and everything in villages -- with his blessings.

Your bible is immoral.  It celebrates those heinous activities of its god.  It also condones slavery, never once condemning it.  Sure, it's got some nice stories in it; but, they don't make up for the immorality it forgives and even recommends.

Thus, your religion is immoral, because it is based on your god and your bible.


Sincerely,
Mark
