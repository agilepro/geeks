Most people, liberal and conservative, probably agree that the world is safer without Saddam Hussein
in power.  Here's the big question; is it worth the cost?

Is it worth having over 500 American soldiers killed, and over 2,000 seriously injured?  Is it worth
having over 8,000 Iraqi citizens and probably well over 10,000 Iraqi soldiers killed?  Is it worth
having the U.S. seen worldwide as failing to co-operate with other most nations, and then almost
unilaterally removing another nation's government?  Is it worth having the U.S. lose its moral
leadership for peace?  Is it worth having a Bush Doctrine which is now, "if a nation that we
don't like has any weapons of mass destruction program-related activities," we reserve the right
to invade?

I don't think it's worth the cost.
