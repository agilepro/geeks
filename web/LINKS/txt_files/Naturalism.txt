Sorry.  I am trying to get some exposure for my book.

I have visited your site and share your views which is obvious in my book, TAKING NATURE BY THE HAND which should be of interest to all unbelievers. Take for example the assertion that science cannot prove that there is no God. People defend religion by telling us that science can only deal with what is natural and observable and is not competent to deal with the supernatural; religion is revelatory and is a different kind of knowledge. It is true that science cannot deal with the supernatural, but science is not helpless in the face of this claim. It is increasingly competent in human behavior including the causes of such beliefs. Once the natural causes are known, there is no good reason to take seriously anyone's claim to have received revelation. 

In TAKING NATURE BY THE HAND I put religion in its place by pointing out that the assumption of natural law is in everything we do in applying means to ends and that survival depends on it. I call this a constant in our lives while supernatural beliefs are variables; they are culturally acquired and vary as the culture, with one having as much claim to truth, or the lack of it, as another. Although I can only claim this as a philosophical position for myself, I think it is scientifically verifiable. As to the "constant" assumption of natural law, I cite the work of a psychologist Elizabeth Spelke who has shown with her work with children that this is true. Cultural determinism is a commonplace in psychology and occurs because of several human traits, among them, credulity, suggestibility, and self interest. All of the resulting ideas are natural events. 

A synopsis of the book can be seen at http://www.haroldtichenor.com/naturalism.html. 

I see no way to advertise on you site. Is there any way that I can get this message communicated to all of your members? 

Sincerely, Harold Tichenor htich@cdsinet.net
