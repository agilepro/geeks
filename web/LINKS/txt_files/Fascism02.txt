People voted for a "compassionate conservative" and got a conservative Christian.  During the debates with Gore, W was asked a difficult policy question (about Israel, I think), and his response was simply that he "would lead."  He's leading us, alright, right down the tubes.  I think that the Republican party has taken on many aspects of fascism, and The Leader is an important part of that ideology.

The Bush bulldozer is destroying much of what has made America great.  If I allow myself to dwell on it, I get alternately mad and depressed.
