Hello Mark,

I believe it was because of God that the events of 9/11 took place. It is
the immoral values that this nation has took on that will destroy it. I hope
and pray that we have more 9/11s and maybe people will wake up.

This nation is now on a down hill slide with the stock market and I do not
believe it will recover. The Bible says that the whore that sets upon may
waters will be destroyed in 1 hour. Bring it on and get me out of this
sickness that you stand for.

In God I Trust,
