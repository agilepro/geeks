Hi Danny,

I just put together a paper/speech on "Why I am an Atheist."  It contains the basis for why Atheism is true.  Basically, it shows that after examining all the arguments put forth, there is no credible evidence for the existence of any god or gods.  With that (and our Constitution) in mind, it seems ridiculous that our government should give so much credence to the superstitions of most religions.  Below is the section on state/church separation, followed by some quotes that I like.  I hope that this helps.  If you would like, I could send you the whole speech.  You may find it interesting and challenging.

There are many Atheist websites and books.  Our site links to most of the important sites, and lists several good books.  The links section at http://www.godlessgeeks.com/links.html is probably the best place for you to start.

I would be interested in what you think.

Sincerely,
Mark
