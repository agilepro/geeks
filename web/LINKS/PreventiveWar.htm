<h2>Preventive War: A Failed Doctrine</h2>
NYTimes Editorial<br>
Published: September 12, 2004<p>

If facts mattered in American politics, the Bush-Cheney ticket
 would not be basing its re-election campaign on the
fear-mongering contention that the surest defense against future
terrorist attacks lies in the badly discredited doctrine of
preventive war. Vice President Dick Cheney took this argument to
a disgraceful low last week when he implied that electing <ALT-CODE value="Kerry, John F" idsrc="nyt-per-pol" />
John Kerry and returning to traditional American foreign policy
values would invite a devastating new strike.
<p>So far, the preventive war doctrine has had one real test:
the invasion of Iraq. Mr. Bush terrified millions of Americans
into believing that forcibly changing the regime in Baghdad was
the only way to keep Iraq's supposed stockpiles of
unconventional weapons out of the hands of Al Qaeda. Then it
turned out that there were no stockpiles and no operational
links between Saddam Hussein's regime and Al Qaeda's
anti-American terrorism. Meanwhile, America's longstanding
defensive alliances were weakened and the bulk of America's
ground combat troops tied down in Iraq for what now appears to
be many years to come. If that is making this country safer, it
is hard to see how. The real lesson is that America dangerously
erodes its military and diplomatic defenses when it charges off
unwisely after hypothetical enemies.
<p>Before the Iraq fiasco, American leaders rightly viewed war
as a last resort, appropriate only when the nation's vital
interests were actively threatened and reasonable diplomatic
efforts had been exhausted. That view always left room for
pre-emptive attacks; America is under no obligation to sit and
wait, if it is clear that some enemy is actually preparing to
strike first. But it correctly drew the line at preventive wars
against potential foes who might, or might not, be thinking
about doing something dangerous. As the administration's
disastrous experience in Iraq amply demonstrates, that is still
the wisest course and the one that keeps America most secure in
an increasingly dangerous era.
<p>The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, plainly ushered in a
new era of catastrophic threats to the American homeland. If
these are to be met effectively, major changes in national
security policy will be required. But a shift toward preventive
wars is not one of them. As the 9/11 commission report clearly
established, international terrorist groups like Al Qaeda are
highly mobile, self-financing and largely independent of
traditional states. Governments that grant them sanctuary and
facilities, like Afghanistan under the Taliban or Sudan, must
face strong international pressure, including American military
attack. Any attempt by the president and his surrogates to lump
the invasion of Afghanistan into the category of preventive wars
is plain wrong. In fact, the war in Iraq has undermined the
important work that American forces are doing in Afghanistan by
diverting soldiers, supplies and money.
<p>Al Qaeda has already declared war on the United States, and
America needs to fight back relentlessly - in Afghanistan and
through international efforts to capture terrorist leaders who
function with forged passports and visas, safe houses and
sleeper cells. That is why Mr. Cheney is also wrong to disparage
law-enforcement cooperation with allies as an important weapon
in this war.
<p>Instead, he promises more preventive, offensive wars against
hypothetical dangers like Iraq. Besides estranging America from
its main European and Asian allies, and leaving Washington
looking like an aggressor to much of the Arab and Muslim world,
these policies kill American soldiers and civilians in the
countries attacked, and they threaten to tie down the Army and
Marine divisions America needs to have available for responding
to real threats in the dangerous decades ahead.
