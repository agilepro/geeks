<p>Damage to an area of the brain behind the forehead, inches behind the
eyes, transforms the way people make moral judgments in
life-or-death situations, scientists are reporting
today. In a new study, people with this rare injury
expressed increased willingness to kill or harm another
person if doing so would save others' lives.
<p>The findings are the most direct evidence to date that
humans’ native revulsion for hurting others relies on a
part of neural anatomy, one that likely evolved before
the brain regions responsible for analysis and planning.
<p>The researchers emphasize that the study was small
and that the moral decisions were hypothetical; the
results cannot predict how people with or without brain
injuries will act in real life-or-death situations. Yet
the findings, published online by the journal Nature,
confirm the central role of the damaged region — the
ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which is thought to
generate social emotions, like compassion.
<p>Previous studies showed that this region was active
during moral decision-making, and that damage to it and
neighboring areas from severe dementia affected moral
judgments. The new study seals the case by demonstrating
that a very specific kind of emotion-based judgment is
altered when the region is offline. In extreme
circumstances, people with the injury will even endorse
suffocating an infant if that would save more lives.
<p>“I think it’s very convincing now that there are at
least two systems working when we make moral judgments,”
said Joshua Greene, a psychologist at Harvard who was
not involved in the study. “There’s an emotional system
that depends on this specific part of the brain, and
another system that performs more utilitarian
cost-benefit analyses which in these people is clearly
intact.”
<p>The finding could have implications for legal cases.
Jurors have reduced sentences based on brain-imaging
results, and experts say that any evidence of damage to
this ventromedial area could sway judgments of moral
competency in some cases.
<p>The new study focused on six patients who had
suffered very specific damage to the ventromedial area
from an aneurysm or a
<a title="Recent and archival health news about tumors."

tumor</a>. The cortex is the thick outer wrapping of the
brain, where the distinctly human, mostly conscious
functions of thinking and language reside. The term
ventral means underneath, and medial means near the
middle. The area in adults is about the size of a
child’s fist.
<p>People with this injury can be lucid, easygoing,
talkative and intelligent, but blind to subtle social
cues, making them socially awkward. They also have some
of the same moral instincts that others do.
<p>The researchers, from the
University of Iowa and other institutions, had them
respond to several moral challenges. In one, they had to
decide whether to divert a runaway boxcar that was about
to kill a group of five workmen. To save they workers
they would have to flip a switch, sending the car
hurtling into another man, who would be killed.
<p>They strongly favored flipping the switch, just as
group of people without injuries did. A third group,
with brain damage that did not affect the ventromedial
cortex, made the same decision.
<p>All three groups also strongly rejected doing harm to
others in situations that were not a matter of trading
one certain death for another. They would not send a
daughter to work in the pornography industry to fend off
crushing poverty, or kill an infant they felt they could
not care for.
<p>But a large difference in the participants’ decisions
emerged when there was no switch to flip — when they had
to choose between taking direct action to kill or harm
someone (pushing him in front of the runaway boxcar, for
example) and serving a greater good.
<p>Those with ventromedial injuries were about twice as
likely as the other participants to say they would push
someone in front of the train (if that was the only
option), or to poison someone with
AIDS who was bent on infecting others, or suffocate
a baby whose crying would reveal to enemy soldiers where
the subject and family and friends were hiding.
<p>“The difference was very clear, for all of the
ventromedial patients,” said Dr. Michael Koenigs, a
neuroscientist at the
<a title="More articles about National Institutes of Health, U.S."
href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_institutes_of_health/index.html?inline=nyt-org">
National Institutes of Health</a> who led the study
while at the University of Iowa. After repeatedly
endorsing killing in these high-conflict situations, he
added, one patient told him, “Jeez, I’ve turned into a
killer.”
<p>The other authors were Dr. Daniel Tranel of Iowa and
neuroscientists from Harvard, the
University of Southern California and the
California Institute of Technology.
<p>The ventromedial area is a primitive part of the
cortex that appears to have evolved to help humans and
other mammals navigate social interactions. The area has
connections to deeper, unconscious regions like the
brain stem, which transmit physical sensations of
attraction or discomfort; and the amygdala, a gumdrop of
neural tissue that registers threats, social and
otherwise. The ventromedial area integrates these
signals with others from the cortex, including emotional
memories, to help generate familiar social reactions.

<p>“This area when it’s working will give rise to social
emotions that we can feel, like embarrassment, guilt,
compassion that are critical to guiding our social
behavior,” said Dr. Antonio Damasio, a co-author and a
neuroscientist at the Brain and Creativity Institute at
U.S.C. These sensations in effect put a finger on the
brain’s conscious, cost-benefit scale weighing moral
dilemmas, Dr. Damasio argues, creating a tension that
even trained snipers can feel when having to pull the
trigger on an enemy.
<p>This tension between cost-benefit calculations and
instinctive emotion in part reflects the brain’s
continuing adjustment to the vast social changes that
have occurred since the ventromedial area first took
shape. The ventromedial area most likely adapted to
assist the brain in making snap moral decisions in small
kin groups— to spare a valuable group member’s life
after a fight, for instance. As human communities became
larger and increasingly complex, so did the cortical
structures involved in parsing ethical dilemmas. But the
more primitive ventromedial area continued to anchor it
with emotional insistence an ancient principle: respect
for the life of another human being.
<p>“A nice way to think about it,” Dr. Damasio said, “is
that we have this emotional system built in, and over
the years culture has worked on it to make it even
better.”
