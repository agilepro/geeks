Historians often assume that they need pay no attention
to human evolution because the process ground to a halt
in the distant past. That assumption is looking less and
less secure in light of new findings based on decoding
human <a title="Recent and archival health news about genetics and heredity." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/geneticsandheredity/index.html">DNA</a>.<p>

People have continued to evolve since leaving the
ancestral homeland in northeastern Africa some 50,000
years ago, both through the random process known as
genetic drift and through natural selection. The genome
bears many fingerprints in places where natural
selection has recently remolded the human clay,
researchers have found, as people in the various
continents adapted to new diseases, climates, diets and,
perhaps, behavioral demands.
<p>A striking feature of many of these changes is that
they are local. The genes under selective pressure found
in one continent-based population or race are mostly
different from those that occur in the others. These
genes so far make up a small fraction of all human
genes.
<p>A notable instance of recent natural selection is the
emergence of lactose tolerance — the ability to digest
lactose in adulthood — among the cattle-herding people
of northern Europe some 5,000 years ago. Lactase, the
enzyme that digests the principal sugar of milk, is
usually switched off after weaning. But because of the
great nutritional benefit for cattle herders of being
able to digest lactose in adulthood, a genetic change
that keeps the lactase gene switched on spread through
the population.
<p>Lactose tolerance is not confined to Europeans. Last
year, Sarah Tishkoff of the
University of Maryland and colleagues tested 43
ethnic groups in East Africa and found three separate
mutations, all different from the European one, that
keep the lactase gene switched on in adulthood. One of
the mutations, found in peoples of Kenya and Tanzania,
may have arisen as recently as 3,000 years ago.
<p>That lactose tolerance has evolved independently four
times is an instance of convergent evolution. Natural
selection has used the different mutations available in
European and East African populations to make each
develop lactose tolerance. In Africa, those who carried
the mutation were able to leave 10 times more progeny,
creating a strong selective advantage.
<p>Researchers studying other single genes have found
evidence for recent evolutionary change in the genes
that mediate conditions like skin color, resistance to
<a title="Recent and archival health news about malaria." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/malaria/index.html">
malaria</a> and salt retention.
<p>The most striking instances of recent human evolution
have emerged from a new kind of study, one in which the
genome is scanned for evidence of selective pressures by
looking at a few hundred thousand specific sites where
variation is common.
<p>Last year Benjamin Voight, Jonathan Pritchard and
colleagues at the
University of Chicago searched for genes under
natural selection in Africans, Europeans and East
Asians. In each race, some 200 genes showed signals of
selection, but without much overlap, suggesting that the
populations on each continent were adapting to local
challenges.
<p>Another study, by Scott Williamson of
Cornell University and colleagues, published in PLoS
Genetics this month, found 100 genes under selection in
Chinese, African-Americans and European-Americans.
<p>In most cases, the source of selective pressure is
unknown. But many genes associated with resistance to
disease emerge from the scans, confirming that disease
is a powerful selective force. Another category of genes
under selective pressure covers those involved in
metabolism, suggesting that people were responding to
changes in diet, perhaps associated with the switch from
hunting and gathering to agriculture.
<p>Several genes involved in determining skin color have
been under selective pressure in Europeans and East
Asians. But Dr. Pritchard’s study detected skin color
genes only in Europeans, and Dr. Williamson found mostly
genes selected in Chinese.
<p>The reason for the difference is that Dr. Pritchard’s
statistical screen detects genetic variants that have
become very common in a population but are not yet
universal. Dr. Williamson’s picks up variants that have
already swept through a population and are possessed by
almost everyone.
<p>The findings suggest that Europeans and East Asians
acquired their pale skin through different genetic
routes and, in the case of Europeans, perhaps as
recently as around 7,000 years ago.
<p>Another puzzle is presented by selected genes
involved in brain function, which occur in different
populations and could presumably be responses to
behavioral challenges encountered since people left the
ancestral homeland in Africa.
<p>But some genes have more than one role, and some of
these brain-related genes could have been selected for
other properties.
<p>Two years ago, Bruce Lahn, a geneticist at the
University of Chicago, reported finding signatures of
selection in two brain-related genes of a type known as
microcephalins, because when mutated, people are born
with very small brains. Two of the microcephalins had
come under selection in Europeans and one in Chinese,
Dr. Lahn reported.
<p>He suggested that the selected forms of the gene had helped improved
cognitive capacity and that many other genes, yet to be identified, would turn
out to have done the same in these and other populations.
<p>Neither microcephalin gene turned up in Dr. Pritchard’s
or Dr. Williamson’s list of selected genes, and other
researchers have disputed Dr. Lahn’s claims. Dr.
Pritchard found that two other microcephalin genes were
under selection, one in Africans and the other in
Europeans and East Asians.
<p>Even more strikingly, Dr. Williamson’s group reported
that a version of a gene called DAB1 had become
universal in Chinese but not in other populations. DAB1
is involved in organizing the layers of cells in the
cerebral cortex, the site of higher cognitive functions.
<p>Variants of two genes involved in hearing have become
universal, one in Chinese, the other in Europeans.
<p>The emerging lists of selected human genes may open
new insights into the interactions between history and
genetics. “If we ask what are the most important
evolutionary events of the last 5,000 years, they are
cultural, like the spread of agriculture, or extinctions
of populations through war or disease,” said Marcus
Feldman, a population geneticist at Stanford. These
cultural events are likely to have left deep marks in
the human genome.
<p>A genomic survey of world populations by Dr. Feldman,
Noah Rosenberg and colleagues in 2002 showed that people
clustered genetically on the basis of small differences
in DNA into five groups that correspond to the five
continent-based populations: Africans, Australian
aborigines, East Asians, American Indians and
Caucasians, a group that includes Europeans, Middle
Easterners and people of the Indian subcontinent. The
clusterings reflect “serial founder effects,” Dr.
Feldman said, meaning that as people migrated around the
world, each new population carried away just part of the
genetic variation in the one it was derived from.
<p>The new scans for selection show so far that the
populations on each continent have evolved independently
in some ways as they responded to local climates,
diseases and, perhaps, behavioral situations.
<p>The concept of race as having a biological basis is
controversial, and most geneticists are reluctant to
describe it that way. But some say the genetic
clustering into continent-based groups does correspond
roughly to the popular conception of racial groups.
<p>“There are difficulties in where you put boundaries
on the globe, but we know now there are enough genetic
differences between people from different parts of the
world that you can classify people in groups that
correspond to popular notions of race,” Dr. Pritchard
said.
<p>David Reich, a population geneticist at the Harvard
Medical School, said that the term “race” was
scientifically inexact and that he preferred “ancestry.”
Genetic tests of ancestry are now so precise, he said,
that they can identify not just Europeans but can
distinguish between northern and southern Europeans.
Ancestry tests are used in trying to identify genes for
disease risk by comparing patients with healthy people.
People of different races are excluded in such studies.
Their genetic differences would obscure the genetic
difference between patients and unaffected people.
<p>No one yet knows to what extent natural selection for
local conditions may have forced the populations on each
continent down different evolutionary tracks. But those
tracks could turn out to be somewhat parallel. At least
some of the evolutionary changes now emerging have
clearly been convergent, meaning that natural selection
has made use of the different mutations available in
each population to accomplish the same adaptation.
<p>This is the case with lactose tolerance in European
and African peoples and with pale skin in East Asians
and Europeans.
