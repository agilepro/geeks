<h1>Mass Muslim Marriage in Gaza</h1> 
<p><img width=462 height=429 src="mm1.jpg">
<h3>Muhammed married a six year old bride. But Islam has evolved in 1500 years. In
Hamas land, in 2009, the brides are almost seven.</h3>
<h2>450 Grooms Wed GIRLS Under Ten In Gaza</h2>by Paul L. Williams, Ph.D. <a target="_blank" href="http://thelastcrusade.org/">Thelastcrusade.org</a>
<p>A gala event has occurred in Gaza.

<p>Hamas sponsored a mass wedding for four hundred and fifty couples. Most of the grooms were in their mid to late twenties; most of brides were under ten.

<p>Muslim dignitaries including Mahmud Zahar, a leader of Hamas, were on hand to
congratulate the couples who took part in the carefully staged celebration.

<p>We are saying to the world and to America that you cannot deny us joy and
happiness, Zahar told the grooms, all of whom were dressed in identical black
suits and hailed from the nearby Jabalia refugee camp.

<p>Each groom received a gift of 500 dollars from Hamas.

<p>The pre-pubescent girls, dressed in white gowns and adorned with garish make-up,
received bridal bouquets.

<p>"We are presenting this wedding as a gift to our people who stood firm in the
face of the siege and the war," Local Hamas strongman Ibrahim Salaf said in a speech.

<p>The wedding photos tell the rest of the sordid tale.

<p>The International Center for Research on Women now estimates that there are 51 million child brides
now living on planet Earth and almost all in Muslim countries.

<p>Twenty-nine percent of these child brides are regularly beaten and molested by
their husbands in Egypt; twenty six percent receive similar abuse in Jordan.

<p>Every year, three million Muslim girls are subjected to genital mutilation,
according to UNICEF. This practice has not been outlawed in many parts of America.

<p>The Islamic practice of pedophilia dates back to the prophet Muhammad, who
amassed eleven wives and many concubines after the death of his first wife Khadijah in 619 A.D.

<p><img border=0 width=544 height=375 src="mm3.jpg">

<p>After Muhammad's elderly wife, Khadijah, died in 619 A.D., he amassed eleven wives. He arranged the visits to the
tents of his women around their menstrual cycles. His capacity for sexual congress seemed to be boundless. <i>Sahih
Bukhari</i>, one of the most Revered Islamic texts, recounts: The Prophet used to visit his wives in a round,
during the day and night, and they were eleven in number. I asked Anas, "Had the Prophet the strength for it?" Anas replied,
"We used to say that the Prophet had the [sexual] stamina Of thirty [men]." [1]

<p>For in-between treats, the Prophet kept a stable of concubines, including
Reihana, his Jewish captive. His wives and mistresses were compelled by Islamic law to
satisfy his sexual needs at any time of the day or night, and the Prophet reserved the right
to enjoy them from the top of their heads to the bottom of their feet. [2]

<p>This might not appear shocking to students of the Kinsley Report, except for the
case Of Aisha, Muhammad's favorite wife. Aisha was the daughter of Abu Bakr, the
Prophet&#39;s closest friend and most faithful follower. As soon as Muhammad laid eyes on
Aisha, he came to fantasize having sex with her. There was a problem with this fantasy. Aisha, at that time,
was a small child of four or five, while Muhammad was a middle-aged man of fifty. [3]

<p>Still and all, the Prophet wasted no time in making his fantasy a reality. When
Aisha turned six, Muhammad asked Abu Bakr for his daughter&#39;s hand in marriage. Abu Bakr thought
that such A union would be improper - not because Aisha was a mere child but rather
because he considered himself Muhammads brother. The Prophet quickly brushed aside this objection by
saying that the union was perfectly right in the eyes of Allah. Abu Bakr consented. And Muhammad took the little girl as his new bride.

<p>When they were married, Muhammad, in his mercy, permitted Aisha to take her
toys, including her dolls, to their new tent.[4] The marriage was consummated when Aisha was nine, and the
Prophet fifty-three.[5] The three year waiting period was not caused by Muhammad concern of sexually
molesting a child. But rather by the fact that Aisha contracted some disease which caused her to lose her hair. [6]

<p><img border=0 width=480 height=360 src="mm4.jpg">

<p>Pedophilia was not only practiced by Muhammad but also sanctioned by the Quran. In its discussion of the waiting period required
to determine if a wife is pregnant before divorce, the sacred text says if you are in doubt concerning those of
your wives who have ceased menstruating, know that their waiting period shall be
three months. The same shall apply to those who have not yet menstruated.(65:4). Those who think that modern Muslims
have abandoned this teaching should study
the pictures and videos that accompany this article and recall the words of Ayatollah Khomeini,
the most famous Islamic cleric of the 20<sup>th</sup>Century: <i>A man can have sexual pleasure from a child as young as a baby.
However, he should not penetrate; sodomizing the child is OK. If a man penetrates and damages the child, then
he should be responsible for her subsistence all her life. This girl, however, does not count as one
of his four permanent wives. The man will not be eligible to marry the girl&#39;s sister. It is better for
a girl to marry in such a time when she would begin menstruation at her husband&#39;s house rather than her
father&#39;s house. Any father marrying his daughter so young will have a permanent place in heaven.</i> [7]
