<p><br><font face="Palatino">Almost from the moment <i>The Origin of Species</i>
was published in 1859, the opponents of evolution have fought a long, losing
battle against their Darwinian foes. Today, like a prizefighter in the late
rounds losing badly on points, they've placed their hopes in one big punch –
a single claim that might smash through the overwhelming weight of
scientific evidence to bring Darwin to the canvas once and for all. Their
name for this virtual roundhouse right is "intelligent design." </font>
<p><font face="Palatino">In the last several years, the intelligent design
movement has attempted to move against science education standards in
several American states, most famously in Kansas and Ohio (Holden 1999; Gura
2002). The principal claim made by adherents of this view is that they can
detect the presence of "intelligent design" in complex biological systems.
As evidence, they cite a number of specific examples, including the
vertebrate blood clotting cascade, the eukaryotic cilium, and most notably,
the eubacterial flagellum (Behe 1996a, Behe 2002).</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">Of all these examples, the flagellum has been
presented so often as a counter-example to evolution that it might well be
considered the "poster child" of the modern anti-evolution movement.
Variations of its image (Figure 1) now appear on web pages of anti-evolution
groups like the Discovery Institute, and on the covers of "intelligent
design" books such as William Dembski's <i>No Free Lunch</i> (Dembski
2002a). To anti-evolutionists, the high status of the flagellum reflects the
supposed fact that it could not possibly have been produced by an
evolutionary pathway.</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino">There is, to be sure, nothing new or novel in an
anti-evolutionist pointing to a complex or intricate natural structure, and
professing skepticism that it could have been produced by the "random"
processes of mutation and natural selection. Nonetheless, the "argument from
personal incredulity," as such sentiment has been appropriately described,
has been a weapon of little value in the anti-evolution movement. Anyone can
state at any time that <i>they</i> cannot imagine how evolutionary
mechanisms might have produced a certain species, organ, structure. Such
statements, obviously, are personal – and they say more about the
limitations of those who make them than they do about the limitations of
Darwinian mechanisms. </font>
<p><font face="Palatino">The hallmark of the intelligent design movement,
however, is that it purports to rise above the level of personal skepticism.
It claims to have found a <i>reason</i> why evolution could not have
produced a structure like the bacterial flagellum, a reason based on sound,
solid scientific evidence.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">Why does the intelligent design movement regard the
flagellum as unevolvable? Because it is said to possesses a quality known as
"irreducible complexity." Irreducibly complex structures, we are told, could
not have been produced by evolution, or, for that matter, by any natural
process. They do exist, however, and therefore they must have been produced
by something. That something could only be an outside intelligent agency
operating beyond the laws of nature – an intelligent designer. That, simply
stated, is the core of the new argument from design, and the intellectual
basis of the intelligent design movement.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">The great irony of the flagellum's increasing
acceptance as an icon of anti-evolution is that fact that research had
demolished its status as an example of irreducible complexity almost at the
very moment it was first proclaimed. The purpose of this article is to
explore the arguments by which the flagellum's notoriety has been achieved,
and to review the research developments that have now undermined they very
foundations of those arguments.</font>
<p><b><font face="Palatino" size=4>The Argument's Origins</font></b>
<p><font face="Palatino">The flagellum owes its status principally to <i>
Darwin's Black Box</i> (Behe 1996a) a book by Michael Behe that employed it
in a carefully-crafted anti-evolution argument. Building upon William
Paley's well-known "argument from design," Behe sought to bring the argument
two centuries forward into the realm of biochemistry. Like Paley, Behe
appealed to his readers to appreciate the intricate complexity of living
organisms as evidence for the work of a designer. Unlike Paley, however, he
raised the argument to a new level, claiming to have discovered a scientific
principle that could be used to prove that certain structures could not have
been produced by evolution. That principle goes by the name of "irreducible
complexity."</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">An irreducibly complex structure is defined as ". .
. a single system composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that
contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the
parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning." (Behe 1996a, 39)
Why would such systems present difficulties for Darwinism? Because they
could not possibly have been produced by the process of evolution:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<dir>
<dir>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Helvetica"><i>"An irreducibly complex system cannot
be produced directly by numerous, successive, slight modifications
of a precursor system, because any precursor to an irreducibly
complex system that is missing a part is by definition
nonfunctional. .... Since natural selection can only choose systems
that are already working, then if a biological system cannot be
produced gradually it would have to arise as an integrated unit, in
one fell swoop, for natural selection to have anything to act on."
</i>(Behe 1996b) </font></p>
</blockquote>
</dir>
</dir>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Palatino">The phrase "numerous, successive, slight
modifications" is not accidental. The very same words were used by Charles
Darwin in <i>The Origin of Species</i> in describing the conditions that had
to be met for his theory to be true. As Darwin wrote, if one could find an
organ or structure that could not have been formed by "numerous, successive,
slight modifications," his "theory would absolutely break down" (Darwin
1859, 191). To anti-evolutionists, the bacterial flagellum is now regarded
as exactly such a case – an "irreducibly complex system" which "cannot be
produced directly by numerous successive, slight modifications." A system
that could not have evolved – a desperation punch that just might win the
fight in the final round – a tool with which the theory of evolution can be
brought down.</font>
<p><b><font face="Palatino" size=4>The Logic of Irreducible Complexity</font></b>
<p><font face="Palatino">Living cells are filled, of course, with complex
structures whose detailed evolutionary origins are not known. Therefore, in
fashioning an argument against evolution one might pick nearly any cellular
structure, the ribosome for example, and claim – correctly – that its origin
has not been explained in detail by evolution. </font>
<p><font face="Palatino">Such arguments are easy to make, of course, but
nature of scientific progress renders them far from compelling. The lack of
a detailed current explanation for a structure, organ, or process does not
mean that science will never come up with one. As an example, one might
consider the question of how left-right asymmetry arises in vertebrate
development, a question that was beyond explanation until the 1990s
(Belmonte 1999). In 1990 one might have argued that the body's left-right
asymmetry could just as well be explained by the intervention of a designer
as by an unknown molecular mechanism. Only a decade later, the actual
molecular mechanism was identified (Stern 2002), and any claim one might
have made for the intervention of a designer would have been discarded. The
same point can be made, of course, regarding any structure or mechanism
whose origins are not yet understood.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">The utility of the bacterial flagellum is that it
seems to rise above this "argument from ignorance." By asserting that it is
a structure "in which the removal of an element would cause the whole system
to cease functioning" (Behe 2002), the flagellum is presented as a
"molecular machine" whose individual parts must have been specifically
crafted to work as a unified assembly. The existence of such a multipart
machine therefore provides genuine scientific proof of the actions of an
intelligent designer. </font>
<p><font face="Palatino">In the case of the flagellum, the assertion of
irreducible complexity means that a minimum number of protein components,
perhaps 30, are required to produce a working biological function. By the
logic of irreducible complexity, these individual components should have no
function until all 30 are put into place, at which point the function of
motility appears. What this means, of course, is that evolution could not
have fashioned those components a few at a time, since they do not have
functions that could be favored by natural selection. As Behe wrote: " . . .
natural selection can only choose among systems that are already working"
(Behe 2002), and an irreducibly complex system does not work unless all of
its parts are in place. The flagellum is irreducibly complex, and therefore,
it must have been designed. Case closed.</font>
<p><b><font face="Palatino" size=4>Answering the Argument</font></b>
<p><font face="Palatino">The assertion that cellular machines are
irreducibly complex, and therefore provide proof of design, has not gone
unnoticed by the scientific community. A number of detailed rebuttals have
appeared in the literature, and many have pointed out the poor reasoning of
recasting the classic argument from design in the modern language of
biochemistry (Coyne 1996; Miller 1996; Depew 1998; Thornhill and Ussery
2000). I have suggested elsewhere that the scientific literature contains
counter-examples to any assertion that evolution cannot explain biochemical
complexity (Miller 1999, 147), and other workers have addressed the issue of
how evolutionary mechanisms allow biological systems to increase in
information content (Schneider 2000; Adami, Ofria, and Collier 2000).</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">The most powerful rebuttals to the flagellum story,
however, have not come from direct attempts to answer the critics of
evolution. Rather, they have emerged from the steady progress of scientific
work on the genes and proteins associated with the flagellum and other
cellular structures. Such studies have now established that the entire
premise by which this molecular machine has been advanced as an argument
against evolution is wrong – <b>the bacterial flagellum is not irreducibly
complex</b>. As we will see, the flagellum – the supreme example of the
power of this new "science of design" – has failed its most basic scientific
test. Remember the claim that "any precursor to an irreducibly complex
system that is missing a part is by definition nonfunctional?" As the
evidence has shown, nature is filled with examples of "precursors" to the
flagellum that are indeed "missing a part," and yet are fully-functional.
Functional enough, in some cases, to pose a serious threat to human life.</font>
<p><b><font face="Palatino" size=4>The Type -III Secretory Apparatus</font></b>
<p><font face="Palatino">In the popular imagination, bacteria are "germs" –
tiny microscopic bugs that make us sick. Microbiologists smile at that
generalization, knowing that most bacteria are perfectly benign, and many
are beneficial – even essential – to human life. Nonetheless, there are
indeed bacteria that produce diseases, ranging from the mildly unpleasant to
the truly dangerous. Pathogenic, or disease-causing, bacteria threaten the
organisms they infect in a variety of ways, one of which is to produce
poisons and inject them directly into the cells of the body. Once inside,
these toxins break down and destroy the host cells, producing illness,
tissue damage, and sometimes even death.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">In order to carry out this diabolical work,
bacteria must not only produce the protein toxins that bring about the
demise of their hosts, but they must efficiently inject them across the cell
membranes and into the cells of their hosts. They do this by means of any
number of specialized protein secretory systems. One, known as the type III
secretory system (TTSS), allows gram negative bacteria to translocate
proteins directly into the cytoplasm of a host cell (Heuck 1998). The
proteins transferred through the TTSS include a variety of truly dangerous
molecules, some of which are known as "virulence factors," and are directly
responsible for the pathogenic activity of some of the most deadly bacteria
in existence (Büttner and Bonas 2002; Heuck 1998).</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">At first glance, the existence of the TTSS, a nasty
little device that allows bacteria to inject these toxins through the cell
membranes of its unsuspecting hosts, would seem to have little to do with
the flagellum. However, molecular studies of proteins in the TTSS have
revealed a surprising fact – the proteins of the TTSS are directly
homologous to the proteins in the basal portion of the bacterial flagellum.
As figure 2 (Heuck 1998) shows, these homologies extend to a cluster of
closely-associated proteins found in both of these molecular "machines." On
the basis of these homologies, McNab (McNab 1999) has argued that the
flagellum itself should be regarded as a type III secretory system.
Extending such studies with a detailed comparison of the proteins associated
with both systems, Aizawa has seconded this suggestion, noting that the two
systems "consist of homologous component proteins with common
physico-chemical properties" (Aizawa 2001, 163). It is now clear, therefore,
that a smaller subset of the full complement of proteins in the flagellum
makes up the functional transmembrane portion of the TTSS. </font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font face="Palatino">Stated directly, the TTSS does its dirty work using
a handful of proteins from the base of the flagellum. From the evolutionary
point of view, this relationship is hardly surprising. In fact, it's to be
expected that the opportunism of evolutionary processes would mix and match
proteins to produce new and novel functions. According to the doctrine of
irreducible complexity, however, this should not be possible. If the
flagellum is indeed irreducibly complex, then removing just one part, let
alone 10 or 15, should render what remains "by definition nonfunctional."
Yet the TTSS is indeed fully-functional, even though it is missing most of
the parts of the flagellum. The TTSS may be bad news for us, but for the
bacteria that possess it, it is a truly valuable biochemical machine.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">The existence of the TTSS in a wide variety of
bacteria demonstrates that a small portion of the "irreducibly complex"
flagellum can indeed carry out an important biological function. Since such
a function is clearly favored by natural selection, the contention that the
flagellum must be fully-assembled before any of its component parts can be
useful is obviously incorrect. What this means is that the argument for
intelligent design of the flagellum has failed. </font>
<p><b><font face="Palatino" size=4>Counterattack</font></b>
<p><font face="Palatino">Classically, one of the most widely-repeated
charges made by anti-evolutionists is that the fossil record contains wide
"gaps" for which transitional fossils have never been found. Therefore, the
intervention of a creative agency, an intelligent designer, must be invoked
to account for each gap. Such gaps, of course, have been filled with
increasing frequency by paleontologists – the increasingly rich fossil
sequences demonstrating the origins of whales are a useful examples
(Thewissen, Hussain, and Arif 1994; Thewissen, Williams, Roe, and Hussain
2001). Ironically, the response of anti-evolutionists to such discoveries is
frequently to claim that things have only gotten worse for evolution. Where
previously there had been just one gap, as a result of the transitional
fossil, now there are two (one on either side of the newly-discovered
specimen).</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">As word of the relationship between the eubacterial
flagellum and the TTSS has begun to spread among the "design" community, the
first hints of a remarkably similar reaction have emerged. The TTSS only
makes problems worse for evolution, according to this response, because now
there are two irreducibly-complex systems to deal with. The flagellum is
still irreducibly complex – but so is the TTSS. But now there are two
systems for evolutionists to explain instead of just one.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">Unfortunately for this line of argument, the claim
that one irreducibly-complex system might contain another is
self-contradictory. To understand this, we need to remember that the entire
point of the design argument, as exemplified by the flagellum, is that only
the entire biochemical machine, with all of its parts, is functional. For
the intelligent design argument to stand, this must be the case, since it
provides the basis for their claim that only the complete flagellum can be
favored by natural selection, not any its component parts. </font>
<p><font face="Palatino">However, if the flagellum contains within it a
smaller functional set of components like the TTSS, then the flagellum
itself cannot be irreducibly complex – by definition. Since we now know that
this is indeed the case, it is obviously true that the flagellum is not
irreducibly complex.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">A second reaction, which I have heard directly
after describing the relationship between the secretory apparatus and the
flagellum, is the objection that the TTSS does not tell us how either it or
the flagellum evolved. This is certainly true, although Aizawa has suggested
that the TTSS may indeed be an evolutionary precursor of the flagellum
(Aizawa 2001). Nonetheless, until we have produced a step-by-step account
for the evolutionary derivation of the flagellum, one may indeed invoke the
argument from ignorance for this and every other complex biochemical
machine.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">However, in agreeing to this, one must keep in mind
that the doctrine of irreducible complexity was intended to go one step
beyond the claim of ignorance. It was fashioned in order to provide a
rationale for claiming that the bacterial flagellum couldn't have evolved,
even in principle, because it is irreducibly complex. Now that a simpler,
functional system (the TTSS) has been discovered among the protein
components of the flagellum, the claim of irreducible complexity has
collapsed, and with it any "evidence" that the flagellum was designed.</font>
<p><b><font face="Palatino" size=4>Combinatorial Argument</font></b>
<p><font face="Palatino">At first glance, William Dembski's case for
intelligent design seems to follow a distinctly different strategy in
dealing with biological complexity. His recent book, <i>No Free Lunch</i>
(Dembski 2002a), lays out this case, using information theory and
mathematics to show that life is the result of intelligent design. Dembski
makes the assertion that living organisms contain what he calls "complex
specified information" (CSI), and claims to have shown that the evolutionary
mechanism of natural selection cannot produce CSI. Therefore, any instance
of CSI in a living organism must be the result of intelligent design. And
living organisms, according to Dembski, are chock-full of CSI.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">Dembski's arguments, couched in the language of
information theory, are highly technical and are defended, almost
exclusively, by reference to their utility in detecting information produced
by human beings. These include phone and credit card numbers, symphonies,
and artistic woodcuts, to name just a few. One might then expect that
Dembski, having shown how the presence of CSI can be demonstrated in man
made objects, would then turn to a variety of biological objects. Instead,
he turns to just one such object, the bacterial flagellum.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">Dembski then offers his readers a calculation
showing that the flagellum could not have possibly have evolved.
Significantly, he begins that calculation by linking his arguments to those
of Behe, writing: "I want therefore in this section to show how irreducible
complexity is a special case of specified complexity, and in particular I
want to sketch how one calculates the relevant probabilities needed to
eliminate chance and infer design for such systems" (Dembski 2002a, 289).
Dembski then tells us that an irreducibly complex system, like the
flagellum, is a "discrete combinatorial object." What this means, as he
explains, is that the probability of assembling such an object can be
calculated by determining the probabilities that each of its components
might have originated by chance, that they might have been localized to the
same region of the cell, and that they would be assembled in precisely the
right order. Dembski refers to these three probabilities as <b>P</b></font><font face="Palatino" size=2>orig</font><font face="Palatino">,
<b>P</b></font><font face="Palatino" size=2>local</font><font face="Palatino">,
and <b>P</b></font><font face="Palatino" size=2>config</font><font face="Palatino">,
and he regards each of them as separate and independent (Dembski 2002a,
291).</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">This approach overlooks the fact that the last two
probabilities are actually contained within the first. Localization and
self-assembly of complex protein structures in prokaryotic cells are
properties generally determined by signals built into the primary structures
of the proteins themselves. The same is likely true for the amino acid
sequences of the 30 or so protein components of the flagellum and the
approximately 20 proteins involved in the flagellum's assembly (McNab 1999;
Yonekura <i>et al</i> 2000). Therefore, if one gets the sequences of all the
proteins right, localization and assembly will take care of themselves.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">To the ID enthusiast, however, this is a point of
little concern. According to Dembski, evolution could still not construct
the 30 proteins needed for the flagellum. His reason is that the probability
of their assembly falls below what he terms the "universal probability
bound." According to Dembski, the probability bound is a sensible allowance
for the fact that highly improbable events do occur from time to time in
nature. To allow for such events, he agrees that given enough time, any
event with a probability larger than 10</font><font face="Palatino" size=1>-150</font><font face="Palatino">
might well take place. Therefore, if a sequence of events, such as a
presumed evolutionary pathway, has a calculated probability less than 10</font><font face="Palatino" size=1>-150</font><font face="Palatino">
, we may conclude that the pathway is impossible. If the calculated
probability is greater than 10</font><font face="Palatino" size=1>-150</font><font face="Palatino">,
it's possible (even if unlikely).</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">When Dembski turns his attention to the chances of
evolving the 30 proteins of the bacterial flagellum, he makes what he
regards as a generous assumption. Guessing that each of the proteins of the
flagellum have about 300 amino acids, one might calculate that the chances
of getting just one such protein to assemble from "random" evolutionary
processes would be 20</font><font face="Palatino" size=1>-300</font><font face="Palatino">
, since there are 20 amino acids specified by the genetic code. Dembski,
however, concedes that proteins need not get the <i>exact</i> amino acid
sequence right in order to be functional, so he cuts the odds to just 20</font><font face="Palatino" size=1>-30</font><font face="Palatino">,
which he tells his readers is "on the order of 10</font><font face="Palatino" size=1>-39</font><font face="Palatino">"</font><font face="Palatino" size=1>
</font><font face="Palatino">(Dembski 2002a, 301). Since the flagellum
requires 30 such proteins, he explains that 30 such probabilities "will all
need to be multiplied to form the origination probability"(Dembski 2002a,
301). That would give us an origination probability for the flagellum of 10
</font><font face="Palatino" size=1>-1170</font><font face="Palatino">,
far below the universal probability bound. The flagellum couldn't have
evolved, and now we have the numbers to prove it. Right?</font>
<p><b><font face="Palatino" size=4>Assuming Impossibility</font></b>
<p><font face="Palatino">I have no doubt that to the casual reader, a quick
glance over the pages of numbers and symbols in Dembski's books is
impressive, if not downright intimidating. Nonetheless, the way in which he
calculates the probability of an evolutionary origin for the flagellum shows
how little biology actually stands behind those numbers. His computation
calculates only the probability of spontaneous, random assembly for each of
the proteins of the flagellum. Having come up with a probability value on
the order of 10 </font><font face="Palatino" size=1>-1170</font><font face="Palatino">,
he assures us that he has shown the flagellum to be unevolvable. This
conclusion, of course, fits comfortably with his view is that "The Darwinian
mechanism is powerless to produce irreducibly complex systems..." (Dembski
2002a, 289).</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">However complex Dembski's analysis, the scientific
problem with his calculations is almost too easy to spot. By treating the
flagellum as a "discrete combinatorial object" he has shown only that it is
unlikely that the parts flagellum could assemble spontaneously.
Unfortunately for his argument, no scientist has ever proposed that the
flagellum or any other complex object evolved that way. Dembski, therefore,
has constructed a classic "straw man" and blown it away with an irrelevant
calculation.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">By treating the flagellum as a discrete
combinatorial object he has assumed in his calculation that no subset of the
30 or so proteins of the flagellum could have biological activity. As we
have already seen, this is wrong. Nearly a third of those proteins are
closely related to components of the TTSS, which does indeed have biological
activity. A calculation that ignores that fact has no scientific validity.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">More importantly, Dembski's willingness to ignore
the TTSS lays bare the underlying assumption of his entire approach towards
the calculation of probabilities and the detection of "design." <i>He
assumes what he is trying to prove.</i></font>
<p><font face="Palatino">According to Dembski, the detection of "design"
requires that an object display complexity that could not be produced by
what he calls "natural causes." In order to do that, one must first examine
all of the possibilities by which an object, like the flagellum, might have
been generated naturally. Dembski and Behe, of course, come to the
conclusion that there are no such natural causes. But how did they determine
that? What is the scientific method used to support such a conclusion? Could
it be that their assertions of the lack of natural causes simply amount to
an unsupported personal belief? Suppose that there are such causes, but they
simply happened not to think of them? Dembski actually seems to realize that
this is a serious problem. He writes: "Now it can happen that we may not
know enough to determine all the relevant chance hypotheses [which here, as
noted above, means <i>all relevant natural processes</i> (hvt)].
Alternatively, we might think we know the relevant chance hypotheses, but
later discover that we missed a crucial one. In the one case a design
inference could not even get going; in the other, it would be mistaken"
(Dembski 2002, 123 (note 80)).</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">What Dembski is telling us is that in order to
"detect" design in a biological object one must first come to the conclusion
that the object could not have been produced by any "relevant chance
hypotheses" (meaning, naturally, evolution). Then, and only then, are
Dembski's calculations brought into play. Stated more bluntly, what this
really means is that the "method" first involves <i>assuming the absence</i>
of an evolutionary pathway leading to the object, followed by a calculation
"proving" the impossibility of spontaneous assembly. Incredibly, this <i>a
priori </i>reasoning is exactly the sort of logic upon which the new
"science of design" has been constructed.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">Not surprisingly, scientific reviewers have not
missed this point – Dembski's arguments have been repeatedly criticized on
this issue and on many others (Orr 2002; Charlesworth 2002; Padian 2002).</font>
<p><b><font face="Palatino" size=4>Designing the Cycle</font></b>
<p><font face="Palatino">In assessing the design argument, therefore, it
only <i>seems</i> as though two distinct arguments have been raised for the
unevolvability of the flagellum. In reality, those two arguments, one
invoking irreducible complexity and the other specified complex information,
both depend upon a single scientifically insupportable position. Namely,
that we can look at a complex biological object and determine with absolute
certainty that none of its component parts could have been first selected to
perform other functions. The discovery of extensive homologies between the
Type III secretory system and the flagellum has now shown just how wrong
that position was.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">When anti-evolutionary arguments featuring the
bacterial flagellum rose into prominence, beginning with the 1996
publication of Darwin's Black Box (Behe 1996a), they were predicated upon
the assertion that each of the protein components of the flagellum were
crafted, in a single act of design, to fit the specific purpose of the
flagellum. The flagellum was said to be unevolvable since the entire complex
system had to be assembled first in order to produce any selectable
biological function. This claim was broadened to include all complex
biological systems, and asserted further that science would never find an
evolutionary pathway to any of these systems. After all, it hadn't so far,
at least according to one of "design's" principal advocates: </font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font face="Helvetica"><i>There is no publication in the
scientific literature – in prestigious journals, specialty journals,
or books – that describes how molecular evolution of any real,
complex, biochemical system either did occur or even might have
occurred. </i>(Behe 1996a, 185)</font></p>
</blockquote>
</dir>
</dir>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Palatino">As many critics of intelligent design have pointed
out, that statement is simply false. Consider, as just one example, the
Krebs cycle, an intricate biochemical pathway consisting of nine enzymes and
a number of cofactors that occupies center stage in the pathways of cellular
metabolism. The Krebs cycle is "real," "complex," and "biochemical." Does it
also present a problem for evolution? Apparently yes, according to the
authors of a 1996 paper in the Journal of Molecular evolution, who wrote:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<dir>
<dir>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Helvetica"><i>"The Krebs cycle has been frequently
quoted as a key problem in the evolution of living cells, hard to
explain by Darwin’s natural selection: How could natural selection
explain the building of a complicated structure in toto, when the
intermediate stages have no obvious fitness functionality? </i>
(Melendez-Hevia, Wadell, and Cascante 1996)</font></p>
</blockquote>
</dir>
</dir>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Palatino">Where intelligent design theorists throw up their
hands and declare defeat for evolution, however, these researchers decided
to do the hard scientific work of analyzing the components of the cycle, and
seeing if any of them might have been selected for other biochemical tasks.
What they found should be a lesson to anyone who asserts that evolution can
only act by direct selection for a final function. In fact, nearly all of
the proteins of the complex cycle can serve different biochemical purposes
within the cell, making it possible to explain in detail how they evolved:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<dir>
<dir>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Helvetica"><i>In the Krebs cycle problem the
intermediary stages were also useful, but for different purposes,
and, therefore, its complete design was a very clear case of
opportunism. . . . the Krebs cycle was built through the process
that Jacob (1977) called ‘‘evolution by molecular tinkering,’’
stating that evolution does not produce novelties from scratch: It
works on what already exists. The most novel result of our analysis
is seeing how, with minimal new material, evolution created the most
important pathway of metabolism, achieving the best chemically
possible design. In this case, a chemical engineer who was looking
for the best design of the process could not have found a better
design than the cycle which works in living cells." </i>
(Melendez-Hevia, Wadell, and Cascante 1996)</font></p>
</blockquote>
</dir>
</dir>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Palatino">Since this paper appeared, a study based on genomic
DNA sequences has confirmed the validity of this approach (Huynen, Dandekar,
and Bork 1999). By contrast, how would intelligent design have approached
the Krebs Cycle? Using Dembski's calculations as our guide, we would first
determine the amino acid sequences of each of the proteins of the cycle, and
then calculate the probability of their spontaneous assembly. When this is
done, an origination probability of less than 10 </font>
<font face="Palatino" size=1>-400</font><font face="Palatino"> is the
result. Therefore, the result of applying "design" as a predictive science
would have told both groups of researchers that their ultimately successful
studies would have been fruitless, since the probability of spontaneous
assembly falls below the "universal probability bound."</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">We already know, however, the reason that such
calculations fail. They carry a built-in assumption that the component parts
of a complex biochemical system have no possible functions beyond the
completely assembled system itself. As we have seen, this assumption is
false. The Krebs cycle researchers knew better, of course, and were able to
produce two important studies describing how a real, complex, biochemical
system might have evolved – the very thing that design theorists once
claimed did not exist in the scientific literature.</font>
<p><b><font face="Palatino" size=4>The Failure of Design</font></b>
<p><font face="Palatino">It is no secret that concepts like "irreducible
complexity" and "intelligent design" have failed to take the scientific
community by storm (Forrest 2002). Design has not prompted new research
studies, new breakthroughs, or novel insights on so much as a single
scientific question. Design advocates acknowledge this from time to time,
but they often claim that this is because the scientific deck is stacked
against them. The Darwinist establishment, they say, prevents them from
getting a foot in the laboratory door.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">I would suggest that the real reason for the cold
shoulder given "design" by the scientific community, particularly by life
science researchers, is because time and time again its principal scientific
claims have turned out to be wrong. Science is a pragmatic activity, and if
your hypothesis doesn't work, it is quickly discarded.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">The claim of irreducible complexity for the
bacterial flagellum is an obvious example of this, but there are many
others. Consider, for example, the intricate cascade of proteins involved in
the clotting of vertebrate blood. This has been cited as one of the
principal examples of the kind of complexity that evolution cannot generate,
despite the elegant work of Russell Doolittle (Doolittle and Feng 1987;
Doolittle 1993) to the contrary. A number of proteins are involved in this
complex pathway, as described by Behe:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<dir>
<dir>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Helvetica"><i>When an animal is cut, a protein called
Hagemann factor (XII) sticks to the surface of cells near the wound.
Bound Hagemann factor is then cleaved by a protein called HMK to
yield activated Hagemann factor. Immediately the activated Hagemann
factor converts another protein, called prekallikrein, to its active
form, kallikrein. </i>(Behe 1996a, 84)</font></p>
</blockquote>
</dir>
</dir>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Palatino">How important are each of these proteins? In line
with the dogma of irreducible complexity, Behe argues that each and every
component must be in place before the system will work, and he is perfectly
clear on this point: </font></p>
</blockquote>
<dir>
<dir>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Helvetica"><i>. . . none of the cascade proteins are
used for anything except controlling the formation of a clot. Yet in
the absence of any of the components, blood does not clot, and the
system fails. </i>(Behe 1996a, 86)</font></p>
</blockquote>
</dir>
</dir>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Palatino">As we have seen, the claim that every one of the
components must be present for clotting to work is central to the "evidence"
for design. One of those components, as these quotations indicate, is Factor
XII, which initiates the cascade. Once again, however, a nasty little fact
gets in the way of intelligent design theory. Dolphins lack Factor XII
(Robinson, Kasting, and Aggeler 1969), and yet their blood clots perfectly
well. How can this be if the clotting cascade is indeed irreducibly complex?
It cannot, of course, and therefore the claim of irreducible complexity is
wrong for this system as well. I would suggest, therefore, that the real
reason for the rejection of "design" by the scientific community is
remarkably simple – the claims of the intelligent design movement are
contradicted time and time again by the scientific evidence.</font>
<p><b><font face="Palatino" size=4>The Flagellum Unspun</font></b>
<p><font face="Palatino">In any discussion of the question of "intelligent
design," it is absolutely essential to determine what is meant by the term
itself. If, for example, the advocates of design wish to suggest that the
intricacies of nature, life, and the universe reveal a world of meaning and
purpose consistent with an overarching, possibly Divine intelligence, then
their point is philosophical, not scientific. It is a philosophical point of
view, incidentally, that I share, along with many scientists. As H. Allen
Orr pointed out in a recent review:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<dir>
<dir>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Helvetica"><i>Plenty of scientists have, after all,
been attracted to the notion that natural laws reflect (in some way
that's necessarily poorly articulated) an intelligence or aesthetic
sensibility. This is the religion of Einstein, who spoke of "the
grandeur of reason incarnate in existence" and of the scientist's
"religious feeling [that] takes the form of a rapturous amazement at
the harmony of natural law." </i>(Orr 2002).</font></p>
</blockquote>
</dir>
</dir>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Palatino">This, however, is not what is meant by "intelligent
design" in the parlance of the new anti-evolutionists. Their views demand
not a universe in which the beauty and harmony of natural law has brought a
world of vibrant and fruitful life into existence, but rather a universe in
which the emergence and evolution of life is made expressly impossible by
the very same rules. Their view requires that the source of each and every
novelty of life was the direct and active involvement of an outside designer
whose work violated the very laws of nature he had fashioned. The world of
intelligent design is not the bright and innovative world of life that we
have come to know through science. Rather, it is a brittle and unchanging
landscape, frozen in form and unable to adapt except at the whims of its
designer. </font>
<p><font face="Palatino">Certainly, the issue of design and purpose in
nature is a philosophical one that scientists can and should discuss with
great vigor. However, the notion at the heart's of today intelligent design
movement is that the direct intervention of an outside designer can be
demonstrated by the very existence of complex biochemical systems. What even
they acknowledge is that their entire scientific position rests upon a
single assertion – that the living cell contains biochemical machines that
are irreducibly complex. And the bacterial flagellum is the prime example of
such a machine.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">Such an assertion, as we have seen, can be put to
the test in a very direct way. If we are able to search and find an example
of a machine with fewer protein parts, contained within the flagellum, that
serves a purpose distinct from motility, the claim of irreducible complexity
is refuted. As we have also seen, the flagellum does indeed contain such a
machine, a protein-secreting apparatus that carries out an important
function even in species that lack the flagellum altogether. A scientific
idea rises or falls on the weight of the evidence, and the evidence in the
case of the bacterial flagellum is abundantly clear.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">As an icon of anti-evolution, the flagellum has
fallen. </font>
<p><font face="Palatino">The very existence of the Type III Secretory System
shows that the bacterial flagellum is not irreducibly complex. It also
demonstrates, more generally, that the claim of "irreducible complexity" is
scientifically meaningless, constructed as it is upon the flimsiest of
foundations – the assertion that because science has not yet found
selectable functions for the components of a certain structure, it never
will. In the final analysis, as the claims of intelligent design fall by the
wayside, its advocates are left with a single, remaining tool with which to
battle against the rising tide of scientific evidence. That tool may be
effective in some circles, of course, but the scientific community will be
quick to recognize it for what it really is – the classic argument from
ignorance, dressed up in the shiny cloth of biochemistry and information
theory. </font>
<p><font face="Palatino">When three leading advocates of intelligent design
were recently given a chance to make their case in an issue of <i>Natural
History</i> magazine, they each concluded their articles with a plea for
design. One wrote that we should recognize "the design inherent in life and
the universe" (Behe 2002), another that "design remains a possibility"
(Wells 2002), and another "that the natural sciences need to leave room for
design" (Dembski 2002b). Yes, it is true. Design does remain a possibility,
but not the type of "intelligent design" of which they speak. </font>
<p><font face="Palatino">As Darwin wrote, there is grandeur in an
evolutionary view of life, a grandeur that is there for all to see,
regardless of their philosophical views on the meaning and purpose of life.
I do not believe, even for an instant, that Darwin's vision has weakened or
diminished the sense of wonder and awe that one should feel in confronting
the magnificence and diversity of the living world. Rather, to a person of
faith it should enhance their sense of the Creator's majesty and wisdom
(Miller 1999). Against such a backdrop, the struggles of the intelligent
design movement are best understood as clamorous and disappointing double
failures – rejected by science because they do not fit the facts, and having
failed religion because they think too little of God.</font>
