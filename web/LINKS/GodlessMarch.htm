GODLESS AMERICANS MARCH ON WASHINGTON<p>
It was a beautiful day to make history.<br>
On a crystal clear cool Saturday, Nov. 2, 2002, thousands of non-<br>
religious Americans marched into a new future together. Old and young,<br>
rich and poor, healthy and frail, locals and travelers from across<br>
continents and oceans, we gathered to carry hundreds of signs and bring<br>
a single message for a better tomorrow, free from the centuries of<br>
foolishness that still threaten American freedoms.<br>
We marched half a mile, from near George Washington's monument to<br>
our national Capitol. For the first time, the religionists were on the<br>
sidelines heckling us! It was a surprising turn of events, and we<br>
loved it.<br>
But the historical day was just beginning.<br>
Speakers from the major American godless organizations united to<br>
proclaim the need for unity of effort. Mike Newdow led the crowd in<br>
the original Pledge of Allegiance. Atheist veterans were recognized.<br>
Candidates past and present spoke. Bands played. Jokes were told.<br>
The heartfelt pleas for unity and action were memorable, and the crowd<br>
clapped and cheered, almost to exhaustion.<br>
But the brilliant words were eclipsed by the more brilliant image<br>
of national godless leaders, standing in front of our Capitol,<br>
protected by our national police, speaking to our crowd on our National<br>
Mall and on our national TV. It is an image we will treasure the rest<br>
of our lives.<br>
The gates had been opened, and the momentum had begun for organized<br>
godless activism. The crowd poured out their enthusiasm. They poured<br>
money into buckets to back up their enthusiasm with commitment. They<br>
poured cards with their names and addresses into more buckets for<br>
future actions to bring a godless America to reality.<br>
The day's events came to an end with another surprise. Religionist<br>
hecklers, kept in check by police on horseback as they lurked on the<br>
sidelines all day, at last turned on their bullhorns, waved their<br>
massive signs, and waded into the crowd to provoke fights with<br>
departing marchers. But the crowd ignored them and departed for home.<br>
We had already won a much more important fight.<br>
It was a shining day of American history.<br>
