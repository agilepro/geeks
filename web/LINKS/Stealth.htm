</div>
In the campaign of 2000, George W. Bush was the classic stealth candidate.&nbsp; He ran as a compassionate
conservative, but after he assumed office we found out that he is an evangelical conservative Christian.&nbsp;
Candidate Bush pledged that his tax cut proposals would be "especially focused on low and moderate income families."&nbsp;
President Bush has shifted the tax burden to middle class families while giving tax breaks to the wealthiest
Americans.&nbsp;
Candidate Bush said he believed gay marriage is a state issue.&nbsp;
President Bush proposed a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage.&nbsp;
Candidate Bush supported the ban on assault rifles.&nbsp;
President Bush listened to the NRA and allowed the ban to expire.&nbsp;
Candidate Bush promised to place mandatory caps on carbon dioxide emissions to help control global warming.&nbsp;
President Bush withdrew American support from the Kyoto Treaty to regulate carbon dioxide.&nbsp;
Candidate Bush promised an open government.&nbsp;
President Bush has created one of the most secretive administrations in recent history.&nbsp;
Candidate Bush promised a "humble" foreign policy.&nbsp;
President Bush has too often adopted a highhanded approach to the world that has alienated our allies and provoked our
enemies.&nbsp;
Candidate Bush demeaned nation building.&nbsp;
President Bush invaded a country to do just that.&nbsp;
Candidate Bush talked about bringing people together.&nbsp;
President Bush has managed to divide the people of the U.S. and the world like no one else in recent times.<p>

President Bush has damaged much of what made America great.&nbsp;
By practically unilaterally invading Iraq, Bush
has corroded our position of moral leadership, aggravated most of our allies, and created more anti-American
terrorists.&nbsp;
By invading with specious reasons, Bush has damaged our integrity and greatly undermined the war on terror.&nbsp;
By subordinating national security to politics, Bush has endangered our nation.&nbsp;
By scrapping the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty Bush has damaged our diplomatic leadership and increased our dangers,
while spending tens of billions of dollars on unproven technology.&nbsp; By withdrawing from the Kyoto treaty,
Bush has lost any international authority we had in protecting the environment, while
increasing global warming.&nbsp; By gutting many of our
environmental regulations, Bush is damaging our environment.&nbsp; By bringing more religion into government
and giving handouts to religious organizations, Bush has weakened the separation of church and state that
is one of the pillars of our Constitution.&nbsp; By using his religion to prevent federal funding of stem cell
research, Bush has seriously hindered work on promising medical breakthroughs that could benefit many of us.&nbsp;
 By reducing taxes while going to war (something no other
civilization has ever done) Bush has created deep deficits and threatened our future economy.&nbsp; What
could Bush accomplish if given four more years?<p>

Our armed forces have invaded and are occupying another country, and we're surprised that they're fighting back.
We are widely perceived as starting another crusade against Islam, and many Muslims are feeling the call of God to
help in the fight against the invading infidels.&nbsp; This could destabilize the whole Middle East.&nbsp; What will
happen next?&nbsp; Will we invade Iran, Syria, Sudan, or even North Korea?&nbsp; It could be argued that we have as
good a reason to invade them as we did to invade Iraq.&nbsp; What if Pakistan, in an anti-Western revolt, throws
out its U.S.-leaning government and installs an Islamic government?&nbsp; The Islamic atomic bomb would be a reality,
and it could be in the hands of those who have given aid to terrorists in the past.&nbsp; What would we do then?<p>
How long will it take for us to re-learn that the best way to influence people is by attracting them?&nbsp;
Few people like to be pushed into a situation, no matter how much we think that it is good for them.&nbsp;
As long as we keep trying to change the world by pushing, other nations and groups will push back - resulting in
soldiers and civilans being killed.&nbsp; We have to find ways to influence others by showing them what they can
gain by doing what we want - like peace and prosperity.
