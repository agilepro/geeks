(1) Mais pourceque j'avois déjà connu en moi très clairement que la nature intelligente est distincte de la
corporelle; considérant que toute composition témoigne de la dépendance, et que la dépendance est manifestement
un défaut, je jugeois de là que ce ne pouvoit être une perfection en Dieu d'être composé de ces deux natures,
et que par conséquent il ne l'étoit pas; mais que s'il y avoit quelques corps dans le monde, ou bien quelques
intelligences ou autres natures qui ne fussent point toutes parfaites, leur être devoit dépendre de sa puissance, en

<li>ST ANSELM’S ONTOLOGICAL ARGUMENT<br>
(1) God exists in our understanding. This means that the concept of God resides as an idea in our minds.<br>
(2) God is a possible being, and might exist in reality. He is possible because the concept of God does not bear internal contradictions.<br>
(3) If something exists exclusively in our understanding and might have existed in reality then it might have been greater. This simply means that
something that exists in reality is perfect (or great). Something that is only a concept in our minds could be greater by actually existing.<br>
(4) Suppose (theoretically) that God only exists in our understanding and not in reality.<br>
(5) If this were true, then it would be possible for God to be greater then he is (follows from premise #3).<br>
(6) This would mean that God is a being in which a greater is possible.<br>
(7) This is absurd because God, a being in which none greater is possible, is a being in which a greater is possible. Herein lies the contradiction.<br>
(8) Thus it follows that it is false for God to only exist in our understanding.<br>
(9) Hence God exists in reality as well as our understanding.<br>
(10) Therefore, God exists.<p>
<li>ST ANSELM'S ARGUMENT FROM REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM<br>a.k.a. ARGUMENT FROM FOOLS<br>
(1) The Fool asserts that God does not exist.<br>
(2) What is called "God" is "a being than which no greater can be conceived."<br>
(3) The Fool agrees that "a being than which no greater can be conceived" exists in the mind, since he understands the words.<br>
(4) To say that "a being than which no greater can be conceived" does not exist is to say
that such a being is only an idea -- it does not exist in the mind and in reality.<br>
(5) But such a being, which exists in the mind alone, is in fact "a being than which a greater can be conceived"
since it is greater to exist in both mind and reality than just mind alone.<br>
(6) So, the Fool believes that "a being than which no greater can be conceived" is "a being than which a greater can be conceived" which is impossible.<br>
(7) Therefore, since "a being than which no greater can be conceived" cannot exist in the mind alone
(because that is self-contradictory) such a being must exist in both mind and reality.<br>
(8) Therefore, God exists.<p>
<li>ARGUMENT FROM KARMA<br>

(3) Revealed scriptures say that God exists.<br>
(4) Therefore, God exists.<p>
<li>ARGUMENT FROM BIG BANG AND QUANTUM MECHANICS<br>
(1) The Big Bang would never have banged if there were no god (or some ET) as observer to collapse the waveform.<br>

(3) If an ET had done it, he would be God.<br>
(4) God is eternal, so if He did exist He must still exist.<br>
(5) Therefore, God exists.<p>

(3) Fundie: "No.&nbsp; You wear clothes because Adam and Eve sinned and were kicked out of the Garden of Eden and made ashamed of their nakedness."<br>
