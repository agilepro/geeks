5.14. From those, too, who call themselves Christians, We did take a covenant, but they forgot a good part of the message that was sent them: so we estranged them, with enmity and hatred between the one and the other, to the day of judgment.

5.64. The Jews say: "(Allah)'s hand is tied up." Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for the (blasphemy) they utter. Nay, both His hands are widely outstretched: He giveth and spendeth (of His bounty) as He pleaseth. But the revelation that cometh to thee from Allah increaseth in most of them their obstinate rebellion and blasphemy. Amongst them we have placed enmity and hatred till the Day of Judgment. Every time they kindle the fire of war, Allah doth extinguish it; but they (ever) strive to do mischief on earth. And Allah loveth not those who do mischief.<p>
5.69. Those who believe (in the Qur'an), those who follow the Jewish (scriptures), and the Sabians and the Christians,- any who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and work righteousness,- on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.<p>

5.73. They do blaspheme who say: Allah is one of three in a Trinity: for there is no god except One Allah. If they desist not from their word (of blasphemy), verily a grievous penalty will befall the blasphemers among them.<p>

5.75. Christ the son of Mary was no more than an apostle; many were the apostles that passed away before him. His mother was a woman of truth. They had both to eat their (daily) food. See how Allah doth make His signs clear to them; yet see in what ways they are deluded away from the truth!<p>
5.82. Strongest among men in enmity to the believers wilt thou find the Jews and Pagans; and nearest among them in love to the believers wilt thou find those who say, "We are Christians": because amongst these are men devoted to learning and men who have renounced the world, and they are not arrogant.<p>
6.115. The word of thy Lord doth find its fulfilment in truth and in justice: None can change His words: for He is the one who heareth and knoweth all.<p>
7.96. If the people of the towns had but believed and feared Allah, We should indeed have opened out to them (All kinds of) blessings from heaven and earth; but they rejected (the truth), and We brought them to book for their misdeeds.<p>
7.97. Did the people of the towns feel secure against the coming of Our wrath by night while they were asleep?<p>
7.98. Or else did they feel secure against its coming in broad daylight while they played about (care-free)?<p>
<a name="8_12"></a>8.12. Remember thy Lord inspired the angels (with the message): "I am with you: give firmness to the Believers: <b>I will instil terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers: smite ye above their necks and smite all their finger-tips off them.</b>"<p>
8.13. This because they contended against Allah and His Messenger. If any contend against Allah and His Messenger, Allah is strict in punishment.<p>
8.14. Thus (will it be said): "Taste ye then of the (punishment): <b>for those who resist Allah, is the penalty of the Fire.</b>"<p>
8.15. O ye who believe! when ye meet the Unbelievers in hostile array, never turn your backs to them.<p>
8.16. If any do turn his back to them on such a day - unless it be in a stratagem of war, or to retreat to a troop (of his own)- he draws on himself the wrath of Allah, and his abode is Hell,- an evil refuge (indeed)!<p>
8.17. <b>It is not ye who slew them; it was Allah.</b> when thou threwest (a handful of dust), it was not thy act, but Allah's: in order that He might test the Believers by a gracious trial from Himself: for Allah is He Who heareth and knoweth (all things).<p>
8.18. That, and also because Allah is He Who makes feeble the plans and stratagem of the Unbelievers.<p>
8.30. Remember how the Unbelievers plotted against thee, to keep thee in bonds, or slay thee, or get thee out (of thy home). They plot and plan, and Allah too plans; but the best of planners is Allah.<p>
8.36. The Unbelievers spend their wealth to hinder (man) from the path of Allah, and so will they continue to spend; but in the end they will have (only) regrets and sighs; at length they will be overcome: and <b>the Unbelievers will be gathered together to Hell;</b><p>
8.38. <b>Say to the Unbelievers,</b> if (now) they desist (from Unbelief), their past would be forgiven them; but <b>if they persist, the punishment of those before them is already (a matter of warning for them).</b><p>
8.39. <b>And fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression</b>, and there prevail justice and faith in Allah altogether and everywhere; but if they cease, verily Allah doth see all that they do.<p>
8.41. And know that out of all the booty that ye may acquire (in war), a fifth share is assigned to Allah,- and to the Messenger, and to near relatives, orphans, the needy, and the wayfarer,- if ye do believe in Allah and in the revelation We sent down to Our servant on the Day of Testing,- the Day of the meeting of the two forces. For Allah hath power over all things.<p>
8.55. For the worst of beasts in the sight of Allah are those who reject Him: They will not believe.<p>
8.65. <b>O Messenger. rouse the Believers to the fight. If there are twenty amongst you, patient and persevering, they will vanquish two hundred: if a hundred, they will vanquish a thousand of the Unbelievers</b>: for these are a people without understanding.<p>
8.67. It is not fitting for an apostle that he should have prisoners of war until he hath thoroughly subdued the land. Ye look for the temporal goods of this world; but Allah looketh to the Hereafter: And Allah is Exalted in might, Wise.<p>
9.5. But when the forbidden months are past, then <b>fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them</b>, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war); but if they repent, and establish regular prayers and practise regular charity, then open the way for them: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.<p>
9.6. If one amongst the Pagans ask thee for asylum, grant it to him, so that he may hear the word of Allah. And then escort him to where he can be secure. That is because they are men without knowledge.<p>
9.13. <b>Will ye not fight people who violated their oaths, plotted to expel the Messenger, and took the aggressive by being the first (to assault) you?</b> Do ye fear them? Nay, it is Allah Whom ye should more justly fear, if ye believe!<p>
9.14. <b>Fight them, and Allah will punish them by your hands</b>, cover them with shame, help you (to victory) over them, heal the breasts of Believers,<p>
9.15. And still the indignation of their hearts. For Allah will turn (in mercy) to whom He will; and Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.<p>
9.23. O ye who believe! take not for protectors your fathers and your brothers if they love infidelity above Faith: if any of you do so, they do wrong.<p>
9.28. O ye who believe! Truly the Pagans are unclean;<p>
9.29. <b>Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day</b>, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.<p>
9.30. The Jews call 'Uzair a son of Allah, and the Christians call Christ the son of Allah. That is a saying from their mouth; (in this) they but imitate what the unbelievers of old used to say. Allah's curse be on them: how they are deluded away from the Truth!<p>
9.38. O ye who believe! what is the matter with you, that, when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of Allah, ye cling heavily to the earth? Do ye prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter? But little is the comfort of this life, as compared with the Hereafter.<p>
9.39. Unless ye go forth, He will punish you with a grievous penalty, and put others in your place; but Him ye would not harm in the least. For Allah hath power over all things.<p>
9.41. Go ye forth, (whether equipped) lightly or heavily, and strive and struggle, with your goods and your persons, in the cause of Allah. That is best for you, if ye (but) knew.<p>
9.51. Say: "Nothing will happen to us except what Allah has decreed for us: He is our protector": and on Allah let the Believers put their trust.<p>
9.60. Truly, if the Hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease, and those who stir up sedition in the City,
desist not, We shall certainly stir thee up against them: Then will they not be able to stay in it as thy neighbours for any length of time:<p>
9.61. They shall have a curse on them: whenever they are found, they shall be seized and slain (without mercy).<p>
9.62. (Such was) the practice (approved) of Allah among those who lived aforetime: No change wilt thou find in the practice (approved) of Allah.<p>
9.64. Verily Allah has cursed the Unbelievers and prepared for them a Blazing Fire,-<p>
9.65. To dwell therein for ever: no protector will they find, nor helper.<p>
9.73. O Prophet! strive hard against the unbelievers and the Hypocrites, and be firm against them. Their abode is Hell,- an evil refuge indeed.<p>
9.88. <b>But the Messenger, and those who believe with him, strive and fight with their wealth and their persons</b>: for them are (all) good things: and it is they who will prosper.<p>
9.111. Allah hath purchased of the believers their persons and their goods; for theirs (in return) is the garden (of Paradise): <b>they fight in His cause, and slay and are slain:</b> a promise binding on Him in truth, through the Law, the Gospel, and the Qur'an: and who is more faithful to his covenant than Allah. then rejoice in the bargain which ye have concluded: that is the achievement supreme.<p>
9.123. O ye who believe! <b>fight the unbelievers who gird you about, and let them find firmness in you: and know that Allah is with those who fear Him.</b><p>
10.4. To Him will be your return- of all of you. The promise of Allah is true and sure. It is He Who beginneth the process of creation, and repeateth it, that He may reward with justice those who believe and work righteousness; but <b>those who reject Him will have draughts of boiling fluids, and a penalty grievous, because they did reject Him.</b><p>
10.73. <b>We drowned those who denied Our revelations.</b><p>
18.86. Until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it set in a spring of murky water: Near it he found a People: We said: "O Zul-qarnain! (thou hast authority,) either to punish them, or to treat them with kindness."<p>
22.19. These two antagonists dispute with each other about their Lord: <b>But those who deny (their Lord), - for them will be cut out a garment of Fire: over their heads will be poured out boiling water.</b><p>
25.52. Therefore listen not to the Unbelievers, but strive against them with the utmost strenuousness, with the (Qur'an).<p>
27.18. At length, when they came to a (lowly) valley of ants, one of the ants said: "O ye ants, get into your habitations, lest Solomon and his hosts crush you (under foot) without knowing it."<p>
33.5. But when the forbidden months are past, then <b>fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war);</b> but if they repent, and establish regular prayers and practise regular charity, then open the way for them: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.<p>
