<h1>God Owes Us an Apology</h1>by Barbara Ehrenreich<p>
The tsunami of sea water was followed instantly by a tsunami of spittle as
the religious sputtered to rationalize God's latest felony. Here we'd been
placidly killing each other a few dozen at a time in Iraq, Darfur, Congo,
Israel, and Palestine, when along comes the deity and whacks a quarter
million in a couple of hours between breakfast and lunch. On CNN, NPR, Fox
News, and in newspaper articles too numerous for Nexis to count, men and
women of the cloth weighed in solemnly on His existence, His motives, and
even His competence to continue as Ruler of Everything.<p>
Theodicy, in other words--the attempt to reconcile God's perfect goodness
with the manifest evils of His world--has arisen from the waves. On the
retro, fundamentalist, side, various men of the cloth announced that the
tsunami was the rational act of a deity enraged by (take your pick): the
suppression of Christianity in South Asia, pornography and child-trafficking
in that same locale, or, in the view of some Muslim commentators, the
bikini-clad tourists at Phuket.<p>
On the more liberal end of the theological spectrum, God's spokespeople
hastened to stuff their fingers in the dike even as the floodwaters of doubt
washed over it. Of course, God exists, seems to be the general consensus.
And, of course, He is perfectly good. It's just that his jurisdiction
doesn't extend to tectonic plates. Or maybe it does and He tosses us an occasional
grenade like this just to see how quickly we can mobilize to clean up the
damage. Besides, as the Catholic priests like to remind us, "He's a
'mystery' "--though that's never stopped them from pronouncing His views on
abortion with absolute certainty.<p>
The clerics who are struggling to make sense of the tsunami must not have
noticed that this is hardly the first display of God's penchant for wanton,
homicidal mischief. Leaving out man-made genocide, war, and even those
"natural" disasters, like drought and famine, to which "man" invariably
contributes through his inept social arrangements, God has a lot to account
for in the way of earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and plagues. Nor has
He ever shown much discrimination in his choice of victims. A tsunami hit
Lisbon in 1755, on All Saints Day, when the good Christians were all in
church. The faithful perished, while the denizens of the red light district,
which was built on strong stone, simply carried on sinning. Similarly, last
fall's hurricanes flattened the God-fearing, Republican parts of Florida
while sparing sin-soaked Key West and South Beach.<p>
The Christian-style "God of love" should be particularly vulnerable to
post-tsunami doubts. What kind of "love" inspired Him to wrest babies from
their parents' arms, the better to drown them in a hurry? If He so loves us
that He gave his only son etc., why couldn't he have held those tectonic
plates in place at least until the kids were off the beach? So much, too,
for the current pop-Christian God, who can be found, at least on the
Internet, micro-managing people's careers, resolving marital spats, and
taking excess pounds off the faithful--this last being Pat Robertson's
latest fixation.<p>
If we are responsible for our actions, as most religions insist, then God
should be, too, and I would propose, post-tsunami, an immediate withdrawal
of prayer and other forms of flattery directed at a supposedly moral
deity--at least until an apology is issued, such as, for example: "I was so
busy with Cindy-in-Omaha's weight-loss program that I wasn't paying
attention to the Earth's crust."<p>
It's not just Christianity. Any religion centered on a God who is both
all-powerful and all-good, including Islam and the more monotheistically
inclined versions of Hinduism, should be subject to a thorough post-tsunami
evaluation. As many have noted before me: If God cares about our puny
species, then disasters prove that he is not all-powerful; and if he is
all-powerful, then clearly he doesn't give a damn.<p>
In fact, the best way for the religious to fend off the atheist threat might
be to revive the old bad--or at least amoral and indifferent--gods. The
tortured notion of a God who is both good and powerful is fairly recent,
dating to roughly 1200 BC, after which Judaism, Christianity, Buddhism, and
Islam emerged. Before that, you had the feckless Greco-Roman pantheon, whose
members interfered in human events only when their considerable egos were at
stake. Or you had monstrous, human-sacrifice-consuming, psycho-gods like
Ba'al and his Central American counterparts. Even earlier, as I pointed out
in my book <i>Blood Rites</i>, there were prehistoric god(desses) modeled on
man-eating animals like lions, and requiring a steady diet of human or
animal sacrificial flesh.<p>
The faithful will protest that they don't want to worship a bad--or amoral
or indifferent--God, but obviously they already do. Why not acknowledge what
our prehistoric ancestors knew? If the Big Guy or Gal operates in any kind
of moral framework, it has nothing to do with the rules we've come up with
over the eons as primates attempting to live in groups-- rules like, for
example, "no hitting."<p>
Yes, 12/26 was a warning, though not about the hazards of wearing bikinis.
What it comes down to is that we're up shit creek here on the planet Earth.
We're wide open to asteroid hits, with the latest near-miss coming in
October, when a city-sized one passed within a mere million miles of Earth,
which is just four times the distance between the Earth and the moon. Then,
too, it's only a matter of time before the constant shuffling of viral DNA
results in a global pandemic. And 12/26 was a reminder that the planet
itself is a jerry-rigged affair, likely to keep belching and lurching. Even
leaving out global warming and the possibility of nuclear war, this is not a
good situation, in case you hadn't noticed so far.<p>
If there is a God, and He, She, or It had a message for us on 12/26, that
message is: Get your act together, folks--your seismic detection systems,
your first responders and global mobilization capacity--because no one, and
I do mean no One, is coming to medi-vac us out of here.
