<h2>Dogs Feel Envy - or at Least Grasp Inequity When It Comes to Treats</h2>

<p>Do dogs feel envy? A provocative new study indicates that they do, making man's best friend the
first species after humans and primates to appear to chafe at being treated unfairly.
<p>Aside from offering the first scientific evidence supporting
what many dog lovers take for granted, the finding adds to the
growing body of literature suggesting that animals, including
dogs, have much richer emotional lives and more sophisticated
behavior than humans have traditionally believed.
<p>"The more we study animals and the more we learn about them,
the more we are realizing <i>that</i> maybe humans are somewhat
different but not really all that different," said
Friederike Range of the University of Vienna in Austria, who led the team that
published <a target href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0810957105">the findings</a> last
week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. "They have
these kinds of feelings, or at least the precursors of these
feelings, that we thought were uniquely human."
<p>Before the new study, the only creatures other than humans
for which there was evidence of anything similar to envy were
monkeys and chimpanzees. When asked to return rocks to their
keepers in exchange for a treat, for example, monkeys that got
cucumbers essentially went on strike and started throwing the
rocks and cucumbers at researchers if they saw other animals
getting grapes instead.
<p>To see whether dogs would respond with similar indignation,
Range and her colleagues conducted a series of experiments
involving 43 border collies, shepherds, retrievers, mutts,
Rottweilers, terriers and other breeds. The researchers sat
pairs of dogs next to each other with their owners standing
behind them. The researchers then:
<p>* Asked each dog repeatedly to give them a paw.
<p>* Rewarded each dog with either a piece of bread or sausage.
<p>* Showed that the pooches would eventually get upset if their
partner was getting rewarded while they got nothing.
<p>"The dogs that were not getting the reward started to
hesitate. You had to prompt them more often to give the paw,"
said Range, noting that some of the deprived dogs would start
acting frustrated, scratching themselves, licking their mouths
and yawning. "They would refuse to look at you, start looking at
their owners or at the other dog chewing, and eventually refuse
to cooperate. They would look away or lay down and not give the
paw anymore if they were not getting rewarded."
<p>To rule out alternative explanations, the researchers
conducted several variations of the test. For example, to see if
the dogs were refusing to give their paw more out of frustration
than from a sense of inequity, they repeated the experiment with
dogs by themselves sometimes rewarding them and sometimes not.
In that situation, the dogs continued to cooperate for much
longer even when they were not getting a treat. The same thing
happened when neither dog in a pair got rewarded.
<p>"It's not just 'Oh, shoot. I'm not getting rewarded, so I
stop working,' " Range said. "If both are not rewarded, that is
not a big problem. But if you rewarded one and not the other,
that's where you saw a problem."
<p>Range hesitated to conclude with certainty that dogs feel
what humans call envy. Instead, she used a more technical term:
inequity aversion.
<p>"It looks like there's something going on there. They are
reacting to the inequity. They stop cooperating," Range said.
"But what kind of feeling it is difficult to say."
<p>Range argued the behavior was not motivated by a sense of "fairness" as
humans typically define it. The dogs reacted only when they themselves were
not rewarded -- not when another dog was denied a reward it deserved.
<p>"If you think about a human situation, a human could say it's unfair that
we both do the same task and you don't get the same reward and I get a
reward. That's not the case for the dog. It's really self-centered," she
said.
<p>The dogs' sense of inequity aversion was also more primitive than that of
the primates. They were satisfied whether they got a piece of bread or
sausage for their performance, Range noted.
<p>Range said she was not surprised by her findings. Many dog owners would
probably argue that their dogs have expressed that behavior.
<p>"Every dog owner will tell you, 'Yes, of course my dog has this.' You see
it a lot if you have two dogs. If you treat one differently, then the other
one would get angry," she said. But demonstrating it in a careful study
helps dispel lingering notions that dogs and other animals are capable of
only the most basic emotions, she said.
<p>"It's definitely very interesting, because it shows that dogs don't just
have primitive feelings like 'I'm afraid' or 'I'm happy.' This is a more
higher level, deeper and profound," she said.
<p>Other experts, while stressing that the study needs to be confirmed by
additional research, praised the work as providing new evidence of the
social acuity of animals.
<p>"As time goes on, we're collecting an astounding amount of
information about the social skills that animals have for
negotiating their social world," said Marc Bekoff of the
University of Colorado, author of the forthcoming book "Wild
Justice," about animal morality. Bekoff noted, for example, that
mice have shown signs of empathy for other mice in danger, that
elephants will go out of their way to care for other injured
elephants, and that coyotes will ostracize other coyotes who
play unfairly.
<p>"From an evolutionary point of view, there's very little that
we have that other animals don't have. Do I think that dogs can
be envious and show resentment and jealousy? Of course I think
they can," Bekoff said.
<p>The sense of envy probably evolved to help the animals
cooperate and probably exists in other animals for which
cooperation is important, such as wolves and perhaps dolphins,
Range said. Understanding how animals cooperate provides
insights into how cooperation evolved, she and others said.
<p>"We're trying to understand how our ability to cooperate
evolved, and one thing that is crucial is our ability to detect
cheaters," said Brian Hare, an assistant professor of
evolutionary anthropology at
Duke University. "One of the things about humans is we can
feel cheated, and because we can make those types of
discriminations, more complex forms of cooperation can evolve."
<p>The findings are especially intriguing given the current
economic crisis, said Frans B.M. de Waal of
Emory University, who did the initial experiments showing
inequity aversion in monkeys and chimps.
<p>"If you look at the crisis in the U.S. and the automobile
industry, people are upset because the executives are driving
private jets and we are driving lousy cars," deWaal said. "There
are many studies of inequity aversion in humans. Economists have
studied this and said only humans have this. This shows it's not
limited to our species. Some of these elements are also evolved
in other animals."
