 DECISION STRIKING GOD PLEDGE IS VICTORY FOR SEPARATION, INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS SAYS
 ATHEIST GROUP </span><o:p>
 </o:p>
 </p>
 <p>A ruling earlier today by a federal appeals court striking down the "religionized"
 version of the Pledge of Allegiance protects individual liberties and the
 separation of church and state, an Atheist civil rights group declared. <o:p>
 </o:p>
 </p>
 <p>The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals declared that a 1954 act of Congress
 inserting the phrase "under God" in the pledge violated the
 Establishment Clause, and coerced students. <o:p>
 </o:p>
 </p>
 <p>"We agree 100% with the court," said Ellen Johnson, President of
 American Atheists. "Putting 'under God' in the pledge was as
 inappropriate as declaring our secular nation "under Zeus," Vishnu
 or any other deity." <o:p>
 </o:p>
 </p>
 <p>"Government should stay out of the business of telling people whether
 or not they should acknowledge a particular deity," added Johnson.
 "The words 'under God' were not part of the original pledge, and they
 were inserted during the height of the cold war in order to establish a
 religious litmus test for patriotism." <o:p>
 </o:p>
 </p>
 <p>Ron Barrier, Communications Director for American Atheists noted that the
 court decision acknowledged the coercive element of the pledge. <o:p>
 </o:p>
 </p>
 <p>"Students who don't believe in a deity shouldn't have to worry about
 being bullied by classmates, or being marginalized in some way simply because
 they don't share a particular religious faith." <o:p>
 </o:p>
 </p>
 <p>As to concerns that the decision might affect religious slogans on the
 nation's money, or in courtrooms, Barrier welcomed today's ruling. "I
 hope we can use this as a legal instrument to stop any government endorsement
 of religion, whether it's by putting 'In God We Trust' on money or hanging the
 Ten Commandments on a courthouse or school house wall." <o:p>
 </o:p>
 </p>
 <p>"Religious belief should be a private matter, not something government
 enforces or endorses." <o:p>
 </o:p>
 </p>
 <p>American Atheists is a nationwide movement defending civil rights for
 nonbelievers and the separation of state and church. It also addresses issues
 pertinent to First Amendment public policy. <o:p>
