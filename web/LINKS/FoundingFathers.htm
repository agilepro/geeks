Not a week goes by on that some idiot TV preacher doesn't contend
that America was founded by Christians and our laws are based on
Christian principles. It's BS. Not one of the first six presidents
was a Christian.<p>
<hr><p><h2>GEORGE WASHINGTON</h2>
The false image of Washington as a devout Christian was fabricated by
Mason Locke Weems, a clergyman who also invented the cherry-tree
fable and in 1800 published his <i>Life of George Washington</i>.
Washington, a Deist and a Freemason, never once mentioned the name of
Jesus Christ in any of his thousands of letters, and pointedly
referred to divinity as "It."<p>
Whenever he (rarely) attended church, Washington always deliberately
left before communion, demonstrating disbelief in Christianity's
central ceremony.<p>
George Washington never declared himself a Christian according to
contemporary reports or in any of his voluminous correspondence.
Washington championed the cause of freedom from religious intolerance
and compulsion. When John Murray (a universalist who denied the
existence of hell) was invited to become an army chaplain, the other
chaplains petitioned Washington for his dismissal. Instead,
Washington gave him the appointment. On his deathbed, Washington
uttered no words of a religious nature and did not call for a
clergyman to be in attendance.<p>

<h2>JOHN ADAMS</h2>
Adams, a Unitarian inspired by the Enlightenment, fiercely opposed
doctrines of supernaturalism or damnation, writing to Jefferson: "I
almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example
of the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved —
the Cross. Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!"<p>
Adams realized how politically crucial — and imperiled — a secular
state would be: "The United States of America have exhibited,
perhaps, the first example of governments erected on the simple
principles of nature; and if men are now sufficiently enlightened to
disabuse themselves of artifice, imposture, hypocrisy, and
superstition, they will consider this event as an era in their
history. … It will never be pretended that any persons employed in
that service [forming the U.S. government] had interviews with the
gods, or were in any degree under the influence of Heaven, more than
those at work upon ships or houses, or laboring in merchandise or
agriculture; it will forever be acknowledged that these governments
were contrived merely by the use of reason and the senses.<p>
John Adams was drawn to the study of law but faced pressure from his
father to become a clergyman. He wrote that he found among the
lawyers 'noble and gallant achievements" but among the clergy,
the "pretended sanctity of some absolute dunces". Late in life he
wrote: "Twenty times in the course of my late reading, have I been
upon the point of breaking out, "This would be the best of all
possible worlds, if there were no religion in it!"<p>
It was during Adam's administration that the Senate ratified the
Treaty of Peace and Friendship, which states in Article XI that "the
government of the United States of America is not in any sense
founded on the Christian Religion."<p>

Benjamin Waterhouse, June, 1814.<p>
…Thirteen governments [of the original states] thus founded on the
natural authority of the people alone, without a pretence of miracle
or mystery… are a great point gained in favor of the rights of
mankind"(A Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United
States of America, 1787–88).<p>
<hr><p><h2>THOMAS JEFFERSON</h2>
It's a commonly stated error that U.S. law, based on English common
law, is thus grounded in Judeo-Christian tradition.<p>
Yet Jefferson (writing to Dr. Thomas Cooper, February 10, 1814)
noted that common law "is that system of law which was introduced by
the Saxons on their settlement in England …about the middle of the
fifth century. But Christianity was not introduced till the seventh
century. …We may safely affirm (though contradicted by all the judges
and writers on earth) that Christianity neither is, nor ever was a
part of the common law."<p>
Jefferson professed disbelief in the Trinity and the divinity of
Jesus Christ, while respecting moral teachings by whomever might have
been a historical Jesus. He cut up a Bible, assembling his own
version: "The whole history of these books [the Gospels] is so
defective and doubtful," he wrote Adams (January 24, 1814), "evidence
that parts have proceeded from an extraordinary man; and that other
parts are of the fabric of very inferior minds."<p>
Scorning miracles, saints, salvation, damnation, and angelic
presences, Jefferson embraced reason, materialism, and science. He
challenged Patrick Henry, who wanted a Christian theocracy: "[A]n
amendment was proposed by inserting 'Jesus Christ,' so that [the
preamble] should read 'A departure from the plan of Jesus Christ, the
holy author of our religion'; the insertion was rejected by a great
majority, in proof that they meant to comprehend, within the mantle
of its protection, the Jew and the Gentile, the Christian and
Mohammedan, the Hindoo and Infidel of every denomination" (from
Jefferson's Autobiography, referring to the Statute of Virginia for
Religious Freedom).<p>
The theme is consistent throughout Jefferson's prolific
correspondence: "Question with boldness even the existence of a God"
(letter to his nephew Peter Carr, August 10, 1787).<p>
"[The clergy] believe that any portion of power confided to me, will
be exerted in opposition to their schemes. And they believe rightly:
for I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against
every form of tyranny over the mind of man" (letter to Dr. Benjamin
Rush, September 23, 1800).<p>
"I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole
American people which…thus[built] a wall of separation between church
and state" (letter to the Danbury [Connecticut] Baptist
Association, January 1, 1802).<p>
"History, I believe, furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people
maintaining a free civil government" (letter to Alexander von
Humboldt, December 6, 1813).<p>
"In every country and in every age, the priest has been hostile to
liberty. He is always in alliance with the despot, abetting his
abuses in return for protection to his own." (letter to Horatio G.
Spafford, March 17, 1814).<p>
"[W]hence arises the morality of the Atheist? …Their virtue, then,
must have had some other foundation than the love of God" (letter to
Thomas Law, June 13, 1814).<p>
"I am of a sect by myself, as far as I know" (letter to Ezra Stiles,
June 25, 1819).<p>
"The day will come when the mystical generation of Jesus… will be
classed with the fable of the generation of Minerva in the brain of
Jupiter" (letter to John Adams, April 11, 1823).<p>
<hr><p><h2>JAMES MADISON</h2>
Although prayer groups proliferate in today's Congress, James
Madison, "father of the Constitution," denounced even the presence of
chaplains in Congress — and in the armed forces — as
unconstitutional. He opposed all use of "religion as an engine of
civil policy," and accurately prophesied the threat
of "ecclesiastical corporations."<p>
"Religious bondage shackles and debilitates the mind and unfits it
for every noble enterprise" (letter to William Bradford, April 1,
1774).<p>
"During almost fifteen centuries has the legal establishment of
Christianity been on trial. What have been its fruits? More or less
in all places, pride and indolence in the Clergy, ignorance and
servility in the laity; in both, superstition, bigotry and
persecution" (Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious
Assessments, Section 7, 1785).<p>
"What influence in fact have ecclesiastical establishments had on
Civil Society? In some instances they have been seen to erect a
spiritual tyranny on the ruins of the Civil authority; in many
instances they have been seen upholding the thrones of political
tyranny: in no instance have they been seen as the guardians of the
liberties of the people. Rulers who wished to subvert the public
liberty, may have found an established Clergy convenient auxiliaries"
(Ibid., Section 8).<p>
<hr><p><h2>THOMAS PAINE</h2>
Paine's writings heavily influenced the other Founders. A freethinker
who opposed all organized religion, he reserved particular
vituperation for Christianity. "My country is the world and my
religion is to do good." (<i>The Rights of Man</i>, 1791).<p>
"I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the
Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the
Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is
my own church" (<i>The Age of Reason</i>, 1794).<p>
"Of all the systems of religion that ever were invented, there is no
more derogatory to the Almighty, more unedifying to man, more
repugnant to reason, and more contradictory in itself than this thing
called Christianity" (Ibid.).<p>
<hr><p><h2>ETHAN ALLEN</h2>
Ethan Allen, whose capture of Fort Ticonderoga while commanding the
Green Mountain Boys helped inspire Congress and the country to pursue
the War of Independence, said, "That Jesus Christ was not God is
evidence from his own words." In the same book, Allen noted that he
was generally "denominated a Deist, the reality of which I never
disputed, being conscious that I am no Christian." When Allen married
Fanny Buchanan, he stopped his own wedding ceremony when the judge
asked him if he promised "to live with Fanny Buchanan agreeable to
the laws of God." Allen refused to answer until the judge agreed that
the God referred to was the God of Nature, and the laws
those "written in the great book of nature."<p>

<hr><p><h2>BENJAMIN FRANKLIN</h2>
Raised a Calvinist, Franklin rebelled — and spread that rebellion,
affecting Adams and Jefferson. His friend, Dr. Priestley, wrote in
his own Autobiography: "It is much to be lamented that a man of
Franklin 's general good character and great influence should have
been an unbeliever in Christianity, and also have done as much as he
did to make others unbelievers."<p>
A scientist, Franklin rejected churches, rituals, and
all "supernatural superstitions."<p>
"Scarcely was I arrived at fifteen years of age, when, after having
doubted in turn of different tenets, according as I found them
combated in the different books that I read, I began to doubt of
Revelation itself." (Franklin's Autobiography, 1817–18).<p>
"Some volumes against Deism fell into my hands … they produced an
effect precisely the reverse to what was intended by the writers; for
the arguments of the Deists, which were cited in order to be refuted,
appeared to me much more forcibly than the refutation itself; in a
word, I soon became a thorough Deist." (Ibid.).<p>
Benjamin Franklin, delegate to the Continental Congress and the
Constitutional Convention, said: "As to Jesus of Nazareth, my Opinion
of whom you particularly desire, I think the System of Morals and his
Religion...has received various corrupting Changes, and I have, with
most of the present dissenters in England, some doubts as to his
Divinity; tho' it is a question I do not dogmatize upon, having never
studied it, and think it needless to busy myself with it now, when I
expect soon an opportunity of knowing the Truth with less trouble."
He died a month later, and historians consider him, like so many
great Americans of his time, to be a Deist, not a Christian.<p>
From:<br>
<i>Benjamin Franklin, A Biography in his Own Words</i>, edited by Thomas
Fleming, p. 404, (1972, Newsweek, New York, NY) quoting letter by BF
to Exra Stiles March 9, 1790.<p>
<hr><p>
"Besides the danger of a direct mixture of Religion & civil
Government, there is an evil which ought to be guarded against. In the
indefinite accumulation of property from the capacity of holding it
in perpetuity by ecclesiastical corporations. The power of all
corporations ought to be limited in this respect. …The establishment
of the chaplainship to Congs. is a palpable violation of equal
rights, as well as of Constitutional principles. … Better also to
disarm in the same way, the precedent of Chaplainships for the army
and navy. … Religious proclamations by the Executive [branch]
recommending thanksgivings & fasts are shoots from the same root. …
Altho' recommendations only, they imply a religious agency, making no
part of the trust delegated to political rulers" (<i>Monopolies,
Perpetuities, Corporations, Ecclesiastical Endowments</i>, circa 1819).<p>

<hr><p>
The Treaty of Tripoli, passed by the U.S. Senate in 1797, read in
part: "The government of the United States is not in any sense
founded on the Christian religion." The treaty was written during the
Washington administration, and sent to the Senate during the Adams
administration. It was read aloud to the Senate, and each Senator
received a printed copy. This was the 339th time that a recorded vote
was required by the Senate, but only the third time a vote was
unanimous (the next time was to honor George Washington). There is no
record of any debate or dissension on the treaty. It was reprinted in
full in three newspapers - two in Philadelphia, one in New York City.
There is no record of public outcry or complaint in subsequent
editions of the papers.<p>
