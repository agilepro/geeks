<p>He was a stock character in 19th-century fiction: the wastrel son who runs up
gambling debts in the belief that his wealthy family, concerned for its
prestige, will have no choice but to pay off his creditors. In the novels such
characters always come to a bad end. Either they bring ruin to their families,
or they eventually find themselves disowned.
<p>George Bush reminds me of those characters — and not just because of his early
career, in which friends of the family repeatedly bailed out his failing
business ventures. Now that he sits in the White House, he's still counting on
other people to settle his debts — not to protect the reputation of his
family, but to protect the reputation of the country.

<p>One by one, our erstwhile allies are disowning us; they don't want an
unstable, anti-Western Iraq any more than we do, but they have concluded that
President Bush is incorrigible. Spain has washed its hands of our problems,
Italy is edging toward the door, and Britain will join the rush for the exit
soon enough, with or without Tony Blair.
<p>At home, however, Mr. Bush's protectors are not yet ready to make the break.
<p>Last week Mr. Bush asked Congress for yet more money for the "Iraq
Freedom Fund" — $25 billion for starters, although Paul Wolfowitz, the
deputy defense secretary, says that the bill for the full fiscal year will
probably exceed $50 billion, and independent experts think even that is an
underestimate. And you know what? He'll get it.
<p>Before the war, officials refused to discuss costs, except to insist that
they would be minimal. It was only after the shooting started, and Congress was
in no position to balk, that the administration demanded $75 billion for the
Iraq Freedom Fund.
<p>Then, after declaring "mission accomplished" and pushing through a
big tax cut — and after several months when administration officials played
down the need for more funds — Mr. Bush told Congress that he needed an
additional $87 billion. Assured that the situation in Iraq was steadily
improving, and warned that American soldiers would suffer if the money wasn't
forthcoming, Congress gave Mr. Bush another blank check.
<p>Now Mr. Bush is back for more. Given this history, one might have expected
him to show some contrition — to promise to change his ways and to offer at
least a pretense that Congress would henceforth have some say in how money was spent.
<p>But the tone of the cover letter Mr. Bush sent with last week's budget
request can best be described as contemptuous: it's up to Congress to
"ensure that our men and women in uniform continue to have the resources
they need when they need them." This from an administration that, by
rejecting warnings from military professionals, ensured that our men and women
in uniform didn't have remotely enough resources to do the job.
<p>The budget request itself was almost a caricature of the administration's
"just trust us" approach to governing.
<p>It ran to less than a page, with no supporting information. Of the $25
billion, $5 billion is purely a slush fund, to be used at the secretary of
defense's discretion. The rest is allocated to specific branches of the
military, but with the proviso that the administration can reallocate the money
at will as long as it notifies the appropriate committees.
<p>Senators are balking for the moment, but everyone knows that they'll give in,
after demanding, at most, cosmetic changes. Once again, Mr. Bush has put
Congress in a bind: it was his decision to put American forces in harm's way,
but if members of Congress fail to give him the money he demands, he'll blame
them for letting down the troops.
<p>As long as political figures aren't willing to disown Mr. Bush's debt — the
impossible situation in which he has placed America's soldiers — there isn't
much they can do.
<p>So how will it all end? The cries of "stay the course" are getting
fainter, while the calls for a quick exit are growing. In other words, it seems
increasingly likely that the nation will end up disowning Mr. Bush and his debts.
<p>That will mean settling for an outcome in Iraq that, however we spin it, will
look a lot like defeat — and the nation's prestige will be damaged by that
outcome. But lost prestige is better than ruin.
