<p>Scientists have discovered fossils of a
375-million-year-old fish, a large scaly creature not
seen before, that they say is a long-sought missing link
in the evolution of some fishes from water to a life
walking on four limbs on land.</p>

<p>In two reports today in the journal Nature, a team of
scientists led by Neil H. Shubin of the University of
Chicago say they have uncovered several well-preserved
skeletons of the fossil fish in sediments of former
streambeds in the Canadian Arctic, 600 miles from the
North Pole.
<p>The skeletons have the fins, scales and other
attributes of a giant fish, four to nine feet long. But
on closer examination, the scientists found telling
anatomical traits of a transitional creature, a fish
that is still a fish but has changes that anticipate the
emergence of land animals — and is thus a predecessor of
amphibians, reptiles and dinosaurs, mammals and
eventually humans.
<p>In the fishes' forward fins, the scientists found
evidence of limbs in the making. There are the
beginnings of digits, proto-wrists, elbows and
shoulders. The fish also had a flat skull resembling a
crocodile's, a neck, ribs and other parts that were
similar to four-legged land animals known as tetrapods.
<p>Other scientists said that in addition to confirming
elements of a major transition in evolution, the fossils
were a powerful rebuttal to religious creationists, who
have long argued that the absence of such transitional
creatures are a serious weakness in Darwin's theory.
<p>The discovery team called the fossils the most
compelling examples yet of an animal that was at the
cusp of the fish-tetrapod transition. The fish has been
named Tiktaalik roseae, at the suggestion of elders of
Canada's Nunavut Territory. Tiktaalik (pronounced tic-TAH-lick)
means "large shallow water fish."
<p>"The origin of limbs," Dr. Shubin's team wrote,
"probably involved the elaboration and proliferation of
features already present in the fins of fish such as
Tiktaalik."
<p>In an interview, Dr. Shubin, an evolutionary
biologist, let himself go. "It's a really amazing,
remarkable intermediate fossil," he said. "It's like,
holy cow."
<p>Two other paleontologists, commenting on the find in
a separate article in the journal, said that a few other
transitional fish had been previously discovered from
approximately the same Late Devonian time period, 385
million to 359 million years ago. But Tiktaalik is so
clearly an intermediate "link between fishes and land
vertebrates," they said, that it "might in time become
as much an evolutionary icon as the proto-bird
Archaeopteryx," which bridged the gap between reptiles
(probably dinosaurs) and today's birds.
<p>The writers, Erik Ahlberg of Uppsala University in
Sweden and Jennifer A. Clack of the University of
Cambridge in England, are often viewed as rivals to Dr.
Shubin's team in the search for intermediate species in
the evolution from fish to the first animals to colonize land.
<p>H. Richard Lane, director of paleobiology at the
National Science Foundation, said in a statement, "These
exciting discoveries are providing fossil 'Rosetta
Stones' for a deeper understanding of this evolutionary
milestone — fish to land-roaming tetrapods."
<p>The science foundation and the National Geographic
Society were among the financial supporters of the
research. Besides Dr. Shubin, the principal discoverers
were Edward B. Daeschler of the Academy of Natural
Sciences in Philadelphia and Farish A. Jenkins Jr., a
Harvard evolutionary biologist. Casts of the fossils
will be on view at the Science Museum of London.
<p>Michael J. Novacek, a paleontologist at the American
Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, who was not
involved in the research, said: "Based on what we
already know, we have a very strong reason to think
tetrapods evolved from lineages of fishes. This may be a
critical phase in that transition that we haven't had
before. A good fossil cuts through a lot of scientific
argument."
<p>Dr. Shubin's team played down the fossil's
significance in the raging debate over Darwinian theory,
which is opposed mainly by some conservative Christians
in this country, but other scientists were not so
reticent. They said this should undercut the argument
that there is no evidence in the fossil record of one
kind of creature becoming another kind.
<p>One creationist site on the Web (<a target="_" href=http://emporium.turnpike.net/C/cs/evid1.htm>emporium.turnpike.net/C/cs/evid1.htm</a>)
declares that "there are no transitional forms," adding: "For example, not a
single fossil with part fins, part feet has been found. And this is true between
every major plant and animal kind."
<p>Dr. Novacek responded: "We've got Archaeopteryx, an
early whale that lived on land, and now this animal
showing the transition from fish to tetrapod. What more
do we need from the fossil record to show that the
creationists are flatly wrong?"
<p>Duane T. Gish, a retired official of the Institute for Creation Research
in San Diego, said, "This alleged transitional fish will
have to be evaluated carefully." But he added that he
still found evolution "questionable because
paleontologists have yet to discover any transitional
fossils between complex invertebrates and fish, and this
destroys the whole evolutionary story."
<p>Dr. Shubin and Dr. Daeschler began their search on
Ellesmere Island in 1999. They were attracted by a map
in a geology textbook showing an abundance of Devonian
rocks exposed and relatively easy to explore. At that
time, the land had a warm climate: it was part of a
supercontinent straddling the Equator.
<p>It was not until July 2004, Dr. Shubin said, that "we
hit the jackpot." They found several of the fishes in a
quarry, their skeletons largely intact and in three
dimensions. The large skull had the sharp teeth of a
predator. It was attached to a neck, which allowed the
fish the unfishlike ability to swivel its head.
<p>If the animal spent any time out of water, said Dr.
Jenkins, of Harvard, it needed a true neck that allowed
the head to move independently on the body.
<p>Embedded in the pectoral fins were bones that compare
to the upper arm, forearm and primitive parts of the
hand of land-living animals. The joints of the fins
appeared to be capable of functioning for movement on
land, a case of a fish improvising with its evolved
anatomy. In all likelihood, the scientists said,
Tiktaalik flexed its proto-limbs mainly on the floor of
streams and might have pulled itself up on the shore for
brief stretches.
<p>In their report, the scientists concluded that
Tiktaalik was an intermediate between the fishes
Eusthenopteron and Panderichthys, which lived 385
million years ago, and early tetrapods. The known early
tetrapods are Acanthostega and Ichthyostega, about 365
million years ago.
<p>Tiktaalik, Dr. Shubin said, is "both fish and
tetrapod, which we sometimes call a fishapod."<p><br>
