<H2>HOGPI and Me - by Casey Young</h2><p>
8 Aug 2002<p>
Since I'll be living in Vallejo before the end of this month, I don't think<br>
I'll be able to continue my counter-protesting at the Sunnyvale Clinic.<br>
<br>
Please... all of you know what's at stake here.  It's women's<br>
reproductive rights, gay/lesbian/trans-gender rights (and respect from<br>
all segments of society), religious/atheist's rights... basically we're<br>
dealing with a bunch of people who want to dictate to others what is<br>
right and wrong, without compassion, understanding, or tolerance.<br>
<br>
Sure, showing up with a bunch of signs once a month is not a quantum leap<br>
in change, but I've been fighting for my rights for decades and know some<br>
progress has been made, but not nearly enough.  I also know that along<br>
with the big successes, it's the day-to-day living of a belief system<br>
that slowly pushes along change.  It's also showing up once a month to<br>
let the self-proclaimed surrogates of God see the people they are so<br>
hell-bent on hating and suppressing--look us in the eye.  It may not<br>
dramatically affect their thinking, but minimally, they know we're not<br>
going down to their narrow interpretation of humanity quietly and easily.<br>
 I believe it keeps a niggling little voice working away in their brains<br>
that their opposition are "good people", not the devils they want us to<br>
be so we can be reduced to a stereotype and easily hated.<br>
<br>
Besides, some of their logic (and resultant actions) is so screwed up, it<br>
is fun to poke those little pins in their self-righteous inflated proselytizing.<br>
<br>
I am begging (and yes, I know it's not a pretty sight) for someone to<br>
help make sure the HOGPIs don't show up unopposed at the SV clinic on the<br>
last Saturday of each month.  It's not healthy for them to think they've<br>
worn down the opposition.  It will feed into their self-righteousness,<br>
thus encouraging them in their outrageously intolerant thinking.<br>
<br>
If I can, I will occasionally drive down to join you.  (Car's 10 years<br>
old and in the last few month's I've had to put in almost $2K in repairs,<br>
most recently because the spark plug wires were arcing.)<br>
<br>
Please continue Jim's many years of work... protect our rights.  I'll do<br>
whatever I can to help.<br>
<br>
New address:  8408 Benavente Court, Vallejo, CA  94591<br>
New phone (old phone # still in effect for a week or so):  707/557-7066<br>
(not set up w/ answering machine YET)<br>
<br>
I plan to contact PP or any reproductive rights group in the Vallejo area<br>
to continue my paltry contribution to the efforts against those who would<br>
subjugate us to their repressive thinking.<br>
<br>
Yours in the name of freedom,<br>
Casey Young<br>
<br>
PS:  May your higher power guide and guard each of you.<br>
