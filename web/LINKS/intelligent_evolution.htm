<cite>The consequences of Charles Darwin's "one long argument"</cite><p>
<i>by</i> Edward O. Wilson
<blockquote>
<p>Pellegrino University professor emeritus Edward O. Wilson, a scholarly
giant of biodiversity and sociobiology, remains at heart a teacher. His latest
lesson concerns the continuing consequences of Charles Darwin’s “timeless
and consistently inspirational” science. At a moment when discussion of
evolution and “intelligent design” preoccupies American political
discourse to a surprising degree, shedding more heat than light on the nature
of life and life science, Wilson invites the serious public to do what far too
few of us have done: to read what Darwin wrote.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In November, W. W. Norton &amp; Company will publish <em>From So Simple a
Beginning: The Four Great Books of Charles Darwin.</em> For this single,
enormous volume, Wilson has selected the versions of, and written
introductions to, each of the iconic texts: <em>The Voyage of the Beagle</em>
(“intellectually the most important travel book of all time”); the first
edition of <em>On the Origin of Species</em> (“the greatest scientific book
of all time”); <em>The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex</em>
(the further step that “Darwin had to take...from the premise that evolution
is universal”); and <em>The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</em>
(“both an old-fashioned descriptive treatise and the most modern of
Darwin’s major works,” which “could serve as a guidebook for
novelists” — and “as part of the foundation of modern psychology”).
<p>Wilson has also written a general introduction, placing Darwin at the very
center of the revolution in modern life science and understanding, and an
afterword, on the “noble yet troubling legacy” that unfolds today in the
collision between religious faith and scientific humanism. In those essays,
reprinted here, Wilson draws on his lifelong immersion in the scientific
enterprise and his study of the foundational Darwinian texts to present his
view surrounding these “great unanswered questions of philosophy.”

<p>We must acknowledge, as it seems to me, that man with all his noble
qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most debased, with benevolence
which extends not only to other men but to the humblest living creature,
with his god-like intellect which has penetrated into the movements and
constitution of the solar system — with all these exalted powers — Man
still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin.

<p><b>Great scientific discoveries </b>are like sunrises. They illuminate first
the steeples of the unknown, then its dark hollows. Such expansive influence has
been enjoyed by the scientific writings of Charles Darwin. For over 150 years
his books, the four most influential of which are reprinted here for the first
time as a bound set, have spread light on the living world and the human
condition. They have not lost their freshness: more than any other work in
history’s scientific canon, they are both timeless and persistently
inspirational.
<p>The four classics, flowing along one to the next like a well-wrought
narrative, trace the development of Darwin’s thought across almost all of his
adult life. The first, <em>Voyage of the Beagle </em>(1845), one of
literature’s great travel books, is richly stocked with observations in
natural history of the kind that were to guide the young Darwin toward his
evolutionary worldview. Next comes the “one long argument,” as he later put
it, of <em>On the Origin of Species</em> (1859), arguably history’s most
influential book. In it the now middle-aged Darwin massively documents the
evidences of organic evolution and introduces the theory of natural selection. <em>The
Descent of Man </em>(1871) then addresses the burning topic foretold in <em>On
the Origin of Species: </em>“Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his
history.” Finally, <em>The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</em>
(1872) draws close to the heart of the matter that concerns us all: the origin
and nature of mind, the “citadel” that Darwin could see but knew that
science at the time could not conquer.
<p>The adventure that Darwin launched on all our behalf, and which continues
into the twenty-first century, is driven by a deceptively simple idea, of which
Darwin’s friend and staunch supporter Thomas Henry Huxley said, and spoke for
many to follow, “How extremely stupid of me not to have thought of that!”
Evolution by natural selection is perhaps the only one true law unique to
biological systems, as opposed to nonliving physical systems, and in recent
decades it has taken on the solidity of a mathematical theorem. It states simply
that if a population of organisms contains multiple hereditary variants in some
trait (say, red versus blue eyes in a bird population), and if one of these
variants succeeds in contributing more offspring to the next generation than the
other variants, the overall composition of the population changes, and <em>evolution
has occurred.</em> Further, if new genetic variants appear regularly in the
population (by mutation or immigration), <em>evolution never ends. </em>Think of
red-eyed and blue-eyed birds in a breeding population, and let the red-eyed
birds be better adapted to the environment. The population will in time come to
consist mostly or entirely of red-eyed birds. Now let green-eyed mutants appear
that are even better adapted to the environment than the red-eyed form. As a
consequence the species eventually becomes green-eyed. Evolution has thus taken
two more small steps.

<p>The full importance of Darwin’s theory can be better understood by
realizing that modern biology is guided by two overwhelmingly powerful and
creative ideas. The first is that all biological processes are ultimately
obedient to, even though far from fully explained by, the laws of physics and
chemistry. The second is that all biological processes arose through evolution
of these physicochemical systems through natural selection. The first principle
is concerned with the <em>how</em> of biology. The second is concerned with the
ways the systems adapted to the environment over periods of time long enough for
evolution to occur — in other words the <em>why</em> of biology.
<p>Knowledge addressing the first principle is called functional biology; that
addressing the second is called evolutionary biology. If a moving automobile
were an organism, functional biology would explain how it is constructed and
operates, while evolutionary biology would reconstruct its origin and history
— how it came to be made and its journey thus far.
<p>The impact of the theory of evolution by natural selection, nowadays
grown very sophisticated (and often referred to as the Modern Synthesis), has
been profound. To the extent it can be upheld, and the evidence to date has done
so compellingly, we must conclude that life has diversified on Earth
autonomously without any kind of external guidance. Evolution in a pure
Darwinian world has no goal or purpose: the exclusive driving force is random
mutations sorted out by natural selection from one generation to the next.

<p>What then are we to make of the purposes and goals obviously chosen by human
beings? They are, in Darwinian interpretation, processes evolved as adaptive
devices by an otherwise purposeless natural selection. Evolution by natural
selection means, finally, that the essential qualities of the human mind also
evolved autonomously. Humanity was thus born of Earth. However elevated in power
over the rest of life, however exalted in self-image, we were descended from
animals by the same blind force that created those animals, and we remain a
member species of this planet’s biosphere.
<p>The revolution in astronomy begun by Nicolaus Copernicus in 1543 proved that
Earth is not the center of the universe, nor even the center of the solar
system. The revolution begun by Darwin was even more humbling: it showed that
humanity is not the center of creation, and not its purpose either. But in
freeing our minds from our imagined demigod bondage, even at the price of
humility, Darwin turned our attention to the astounding power of the natural
creative process and the magnificence of its products:
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having
been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this
planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so
simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have
been, and are being, evolved.

<p>~Charles Darwin<br>
Letter to J.D. Hooker, 1869
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><b>Darwin lived thirteen more years </b>after writing this letter to Joseph
Hooker, and he did manage to modify the theory of evolution by natural
selection, expanding it in <em>The Descent of Man </em>(1871) to include human
origins and in <em>The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</em> (1872)
to address the evolution of instinct. The ensuing 130 years have seen an
enormous growth of the Darwinian heritage. Joined with molecular and cellular
biology, that accumulated knowledge is today a large part of modern biology. Its
centrality justifies the famous remark made by the evolutionary geneticist
Theodosius Dobzhansky in 1973 that “nothing in biology makes sense except in
the light of evolution.” In fact, nothing in science as a whole has been more
firmly established by interwoven factual documentation, or more illuminating,
than the universal occurrence of biological evolution. Further, few natural
processes have been more convincingly explained than evolution by the theory of
natural selection or, as it is popularly called, Darwinism.
<p>Thus it is surpassingly strange that half of Americans recently polled (2004)
not only do not believe in evolution by natural selection but do not believe in
evolution at all. Americans are certainly capable of belief, and with rocklike
conviction if it originates in religious dogma. In evidence is the 60 percent
that accept the prophecies of the Book of Revelation as truth, and yet in more
evidence is the weight that faith-based positions hold in political life. Most
of the religious Right opposes the teaching of evolution in public schools,
either by an outright ban on the subject or, at the least, by insisting that it
be treated as “only a theory” rather than a “fact.”
<p>Yet biologists, particularly those statured by the peer review and
publication of substantial personal research on the subject in leading journals
of science, are unanimous in concluding that evolution is a <em>fact. </em>The
evidence they and thousands of others have adduced over 150 years falls together
in intricate and interlocking detail. The multitudinous examples range from the
small changes in DNA sequences observed as they occur in real time to finely
graded sequences within larger evolutionary changes in the fossil record.
Further, on the basis of comparably firm evidence, natural selection grows ever
stronger as the prevailing explanation of evolution.

<p>Many who accept the fact of evolution cannot, however, on religious grounds,
accept the operation of blind chance and the absence of divine purpose implicit
in natural selection. They support the alternative explanation of intelligent
design. The reasoning they offer is not based on evidence but on the lack of it.
The formulation of intelligent design is a default argument advanced in support
of a non sequitur. It is in essence the following: There are some phenomena that
have not yet been explained and that (and most importantly) the critics
personally cannot imagine being explained; therefore there must be a
supernatural designer at work. The designer is seldom specified, but in the
canon of intelligent design it is most certainly not Satan and his angels, nor
any god or gods conspicuously different from those accepted in the believer’s
faith.
<p>Flipping the scientific argument upside down, the intelligent designers join
the strict creationists (who insist that no evolution ever occurred in the first
place) by arguing that scientists resist the supernatural theory because it is
counter to their own personal secular beliefs. This may have a kernel of truth;
everybody suffers from some amount of bias. But in this case bias is easily
overcome. The critics forget how the reward system in science works. Any
researcher who can prove the existence of intelligent design within the accepted
framework of science will make history and achieve eternal fame. He will prove
at last that <em>science and religious dogma are compatible!</em> Even a
combined Nobel Prize and Templeton Prize (the latter designed to encourage
search for just such harmony) would fall short as proper recognition. Every
scientist would like to accomplish such an epoch-making advance. But no one has
even come close, because unfortunately there is no evidence, no theory, and no
criteria for proof that even marginally might pass for science. There is only
the residue of hoped-for default, which steadily shrinks as the science of
biology expands.
<p>In all of the history of science only one other disparity of comparable
magnitude to evolution has occurred between a scientific event and the impact it
has had on the public mind. This was the discovery by Copernicus that Earth and
therefore humanity are not the center of the universe, and the universe is not a
closed spherical bubble. Copernicus delayed publication of his masterwork <em>On
the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres </em>until the year of his death (1543).
For his extension of the idea subsequently, Bruno was burned at the stake, and
for its documentation Galileo was shown the instruments of torture at Rome and
remained under house arrest for the remainder of his life.
<p>Today we live in a less barbaric age, but an otherwise comparable disjunction
between science and religion, the one born of Darwinism, still roils the public
mind. Why does such intense and pervasive resistance to evolution continue 150
years after the publication of <em>The Origin of Species,</em> and in the teeth
of the overwhelming accumulated evidence favoring it? The answer is simply that
the Darwinian revolution, even more than the Copernican revolution, challenges
the prehistoric and still-regnant self-image of humanity. Evolution by natur-al
selection, to be as concise as possible, has changed everything.
<p>In the more than slightly schizophrenic circumstances of the present era,
global culture is divided into three opposing images of the human condition,
each logically consistent within its own, independent premises. The dominant of
these hypotheses, exemplified by the creation myths of the Abrahamic
monotheistic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), sees humanity as a
creation of God. He brought us into being and He guides us still as father,
judge, and friend. We interpret his will from sacred scriptures and the wisdom
of ecclesiastical authorities.
<p>The second worldview is that of political behaviorism. Still beloved by the
now rapidly fading Marxist-Leninist states, it says that the brain is largely a
blank state devoid of any inborn inscription beyond reflexes and primitive
bodily urges. As a consequence the mind originates almost wholly as a result of
learning, and it is the product of a culture that itself evolves by historical
contingency. Because there is no biologically based “human nature,” people
can be molded to the best possible political and economic system, namely, as
urged upon the world through most of the twentieth century, communism. In
practical politics, this belief has been repeatedly tested and, after economic
collapses and tens of millions of deaths in a dozen dysfunctional states, is
generally deemed a failure.

<p>Both of these worldviews, God-centered religion and atheistic communism, are
opposed by a third and in some ways more radical worldview, scientific humanism.
Still held by only a tiny minority of the world’s population, it considers
humanity to be a biological species that evolved over millions of years in a
biological world, acquiring unprecedented intelligence yet still guided by
complex inherited emotions and biased channels of learning. Human nature exists,
and it was self-assembled. It is the commonality of the hereditary responses and
propensities that define our species. Having arisen by evolution during the far
simpler conditions in which humanity lived during more than 99 percent of its
existence, it forms the behavioral part of what, in <em>The Descent of Man, </em>Darwin
called the indelible stamp of our lowly origin.
<p>To understand biological human nature in depth is to drain the fever swamps
of religious and blank-slate dogma. But it also imposes the heavy burden of
individual choice that goes with intellectual freedom.
<p>Such was the long journey for Darwin, the architect of the naturalistic
worldview. He began his voyage on the <em>Beagle</em> as a devout Christian who
trained for the ministry. “Whilst on board the <em>Beagle</em> I was quite
orthodox,” he wrote much later in his autobiography, “and I remember being
heartily laughed at by several of the officers (though themselves orthodox) for
quoting the Bible as an unanswerable authority on some point of morality.” His
later drift from the religion of his birth was stepwise and slow. Still on
H.M.S. <em>Beagle</em> during its circumnavigation of the globe (1831–1836) he
came to believe that the “false history” and reports of God’s vengeful
feelings made the Old Testament “no more to be trusted than the sacred books
of the Hindoos, or the beliefs of any barbarian.” The miracles of Jesus seemed
to him to suggest that people living at the time of the Gospels were “ignorant
and credulous to a degree almost incomprehensible by us.” The growth of
disbelief was so slow that Darwin felt no distress. In a striking passage of his
autobiography he expressed his final and complete rejection of Christian dogma
based solely on blind faith:
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I can indeed hardly see how anyone ought to wish Christianity to be true;
for if so the plain language of the text seems to show that the men who do
not believe, and this would include my Father, Brother and almost all my
best friends, will be everlastingly punished.
<p>And that is a damnable doctrine.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Did Charles Darwin recant in his last days, as some religious critics have
hopefully suggested? There is not a shred of evidence that he did or that he was
presented with any reason to do so. Further, it would have been wholly contrary
to the deliberate, careful manner with which he approached every subject.

<p>The great naturalist did not abandon Abrahamic and other religious dogmas
because of his discovery of evolution by natural selection, as one might
reasonably suppose. The reverse occurred. The shedding of blind faith gave him
the intellectual fearlessness to explore human evolution wherever logic and
evidence took him. And so he set forth boldly, in <em>The Descent of Man </em>to
track the origin of humanity, and in <em>The Expression of the Emotions in Man
and Animals </em>to address the evolution of instinct. Thus was born scientific
humanism, the only worldview compatible with science’s growing knowledge of
the real world and the laws of nature.
<p>So, will science and religion find common ground, or at least agree to divide
the fundamentals into mutually exclusive domains? A great many well-meaning
scholars believe that such rapprochement is both possible and desirable. A few
disagree, and I am one of them. I think Darwin would have held to the same
position. The battle line is, as it has ever been, in biology. The inexorable
growth of this science continues to widen, not to close, the tectonic gap
between science and faith-based religion.
<p>Rapprochement may be neither possible nor desirable. There is something deep
in religious belief that divides people and amplifies societal conflict. In the
early part of this century, the toxic mix of religion and tribalism has become
so dangerous as to justify taking seriously the alternative view, that humanism
based on science is the effective antidote, the light and the way at last placed
before us.
<p>In any case, the dilemma to be solved is truly profound. On the one side the
input of religion on human history has been beneficent in many ways. It has
generated much of which is best in culture, including the ideals of altruism and
public service. From the beginning of history it has inspired the arts. Creation
myths were in a sense the beginning of science itself. Fabricating them was the
best the early scribes could do to explain the universe and human existence.
<p>Yet the high risk is the ease with which alliances between religions and
tribalism are made. Then comes bigotry and the dehumanization of infidels. Our
gods, the true believer asserts, stand against your false idols, our spiritual
purity against your corruption, our divinely sanctioned knowledge against your
errancy. In past ages the posture provided an advantage. It united each tribe
during life-and-death struggles with other tribes. It buoyed the devotees with a
sense of superiority. It sacralized tribal laws and mores, and encouraged
altruistic behaviors. Through sacred rites it lent solemnity to the passages of
life. And it comforted the anxious and afflicted. For all this and more it gave
people an identity and purpose, and vouchsafed tribal fitness — yet,
unfortunately, at the expense of less united or otherwise less fortunate tribes.
<p>Religions continue both to render their special services and to exact their
heavy costs. Can scientific humanism do as well or better, at a lower cost?
Surely that ranks as one of the great unanswered questions of philosophy. It is
the noble yet troubling legacy that Charles Darwin left us.<p>
