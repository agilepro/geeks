<b>According to former House Majority Leader Tom Delay (R. TX), the Columbine school shootings occurred "because our school systems teach our children that they are nothing but glorified apes who have evolutionized [sic] out of some primordial mud." He has also stated that he was on a mission from God to promote a "biblical worldview" in American politics.</b> (NYT, 12/17/02)<p>
<hr><p><b>The Government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion."</b><br>
— The Treaty of Tripoli, written during President George Washington's term, signed by President John Adams, and <b>unanimously</b> approved by the Senate.<p>
So much for the “Christian” foundation of our country!</b><p>
How many of our first six presidents were Christian?<br>Answer: <b>None.</b><p>
How many of these founding fathers – Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Franklin, Washington - were Christian?<br>Answer: <b>None.</b><p>
<b>" ... no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States."</b><br>
— Article. VI, Clause 3 of the U.S. Constitution<p>
<b>"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,..."</b><br>
— 1st Amendment to the U.S. Constitution<p>
<b>"Free exercise and enjoyment of religion without discrimination or preference are guaranteed..."</b><br>
— Article 1, Section 4 of the California State Constitution<p>
<b>"The day that this country ceases to be free for irreligion, it will cease to be free for religion ... except for the sect that can win political power."</b><br>— Robert H. Jackson, U.S. Supreme Court Justice, 1952<p>
<b>"A government cannot be premised on the belief that all persons are created equal when it asserts that God prefers some."</b><br>
— Harry A. Blackmun, U.S. Supreme Court Justice, majority opinion in Lee v. Weisman, 1992<p>
"Religious beliefs worthy of respect are the product of free and voluntary choice by the faithful. Government must pursue a course of complete neutrality toward religion."<br>
— Paul Stevens, U.S. Supreme Court Justice, 1985<p>

"The lessons of the First Amendment are as urgent in the modern world as the 18th Century when it was written. One timeless lesson is that if citizens are subjected to state-sponsored religious exercises, the State disavows its own duty to guard and respect that sphere of inviolable conscience and belief which is the mark of a free people."<br>
— Anthony Kennedy, Supreme Court Justice, quoted from "The Case Against School Prayer," a <a href=http://www.ffrf.org>Freedom From Religion Foundation</a> pamphlet<p>

"The Ten Commandments are undeniably a sacred text in the Jewish and Christian faiths, and no legislative recitation of a supposed secular purpose can blind us to that fact ... the first part of the Commandments concerns the religious duties of believers: worshipping the Lord God alone, avoiding idolatry, not using the Lord's name in vain, and observing the Sabbath day."<br>
— The U.S. Supreme Court, Stone v. Graham, 1980<p>

"The government may acknowledge Christmas as a cultural phenomenon, but under the First Amendment it may not observe it as a Christian holy day by suggesting that people praise God for the birth of Jesus."<br>
— The U.S. Supreme Court, <a href=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/492/573/>Cnty. of Allegheny v. Am. Civil Liberties Union Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U.S. 573, 601</a> (1989)<p>

"... religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection."<br>
— The U.S. Supreme Court, Thomas v. Review Board, 1981<p>

"(W)e do not count heads before enforcing the First Amendment."<br>
— Sandra Day O'Connor, U.S. Supreme Court Justice<p>
