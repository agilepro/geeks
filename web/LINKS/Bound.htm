<h1>Religion: Bound to Believe?</h1>by Pascal Boyer
<p><i>Atheism will always be a harder sell than religion, Pascal Boyer
explains, because a slew of cognitive traits predispose us to faith.</i>
<p>Is religion a product of our evolution? The very question makes many
people, religious or otherwise, cringe, although for different
reasons. Some people of faith fear that an understanding of the
processes underlying belief could undermine it. Others worry that what
is shown to be part of our evolutionary heritage will be interpreted
as good, true, necessary or inevitable. Still others, many scientists
included, simply dismiss the whole issue, seeing religion as childish,
dangerous nonsense.
<p>Such responses make it difficult to establish why and how religious
thought is so pervasive in human societies — an understanding that is
especially relevant in the current climate of religious
fundamentalism. In asking whether religion is one of the many
consequences of having the type of brains we come equipped with, we
can shed light on what kinds of religion 'come naturally' to human
minds. We can probe the shared assumptions that religions are built
on, however disparate, and examine the connection between religion and
ethnic conflict. Lastly, we can hazard a guess at what the realistic
prospects are for atheism.
<p>In the past ten years, the evolutionary and cognitive study of
religion has begun to mature. It does not try to identify the gene or
genes for religious thinking. Nor does it simply dream up evolutionary
scenarios that might have led to religion as we know it. It does much
better than that. It puts forward new hypotheses and testable
predictions. It asks what in the human make-up renders religion
possible and successful. Religious thought and behaviour can be
considered part of the natural human capacities, such as music,
political systems, family relations or ethnic coalitions. Findings
from cognitive psychology, neuroscience, cultural anthropology and
archaeology promise to change our view of religion.
<h3>Based on assumption</h3>
<p>One important finding is that people are only aware of some of their
religious ideas. True, they can describe their beliefs, such as that
there is an omnipotent God who created the world, or that spirits are
hiding in the forest. But cognitive psychology shows that explicitly
accessible beliefs of this sort are always accompanied by a host of
tacit assumptions that are generally not available to conscious
inspection.
<p>For instance, experiments reveal that most people entertain highly
anthropomorphic expectations about gods, whatever their explicit
beliefs. When they are told a story in which a god attends to several
problems at once, they find the concept quite plausible, as gods are
generally described as having unlimited cognitive powers. Recalling
the story a moment later, most people say that the god attended to one
situation before turning his attention to the next. People also
implicitly expect their gods' minds to work much like human minds,
displaying the same processes of perception, memory, reasoning and
motivation. Such expectations are not conscious, and are often at odds
with their explicit beliefs.
<p>Research has shown that unlike conscious beliefs, which differ widely
from one tradition to another, tacit assumptions are extremely similar
in different cultures and religions. These similarities may stem from
the peculiarities of human memory. Experiments suggest that people
best remember stories that include a combination of counterintuitive
physical feats (in which characters go through walls or move
instantaneously) and plausibly human psychological features
(perceptions, thoughts, intentions). Perhaps the cultural success of
gods and spirits stems from this memory bias.
<p>Humans also tend to entertain social relations with these and other
non-physical agents, even from a very young age. Unlike other social
animals, humans are very good at establishing and maintaining
relations with agents beyond their physical presence; social
hierarchies and coalitions, for instance, include temporarily absent
members. This goes even further. From childhood, humans form enduring,
stable and important social relationships with fictional characters,
imaginary friends, deceased relatives, unseen heroes and fantasized
mates. Indeed, the extraordinary social skills of humans, compared
with other primates, may be honed by constant practice with imagined
or absent partners.
<p>It is a small step from having this capacity to bond with non-physical
agents to conceptualizing spirits, dead ancestors and gods, who are
neither visible nor tangible, yet are socially involved. This may
explain why, in most cultures, at least some of the superhuman agents
that people believe in have moral concerns. Those agents are often
described as having complete access only to morally relevant actions.
Experiments show that it is much more natural to think "the gods know
that I stole this money" than "the gods know that I had porridge for
breakfast".
<p>In addition, the neurophysiology of compulsive behaviour in humans and
other animals is beginning to shed light on religious rituals. These
behaviours include stereotyped, highly repetitive actions that
participants feel they must do, even though most have no clear,
observable results, such as striking the chest three times while
repeating a set formula. Ritualized behaviour is also seen in patients
with obsessive-compulsive disorders and in the routines of young
children. In these contexts, rituals are generally associated with
thoughts about pollution and purification, danger and protection, the
required use of particular colours or numbers or the need to construct
a safe and ordered environment.
<p>We now know that human brains have a set of security and precaution
networks dedicated to preventing potential hazards such as predation
or contamination. These networks trigger specific behaviours such as
washing and checking one's environment. When the systems go into
overdrive they produce obsessive-compulsive pathology. Religious
statements about purity, pollution, the hidden danger of lurking
devils, may also activate these networks and make ritual precautions
(cleansing, checking, delimiting a sacred space) intuitively appealing.
<p>Finally, studies of social and evolutionary psychology demonstrate a
specifically human coalitional capacity, which has an impact on
religion. Humans are unique among animals in maintaining large, stable
coalitions of unrelated individuals, strongly bonded by mutual trust.
Humans evolved the cognitive tools to achieve this. They know how to
gauge others' reliability. They can recall episodes of interaction and
infer what people's characters are like. They can emit and detect
costly, hard-to-fake signals of commitment.
<p>This coalitional psychology is involved in the dynamics of public
religious commitment. When people proclaim their adherence to a
particular faith, they subscribe to claims for which there is no
evidence, and that would be taken as obviously wrong or ridiculous in
other religious groups. This signals a willingness to embrace the
group's particular norm for no other reason than that it is,
precisely, the group's norm.
<h3>Cognitive cache</h3>
So is religion an adaptation or a by-product of our evolution? Perhaps
one day we will find compelling evidence that a capacity for religious
thoughts, rather than 'religion' in the modern form of socio-political
institutions, contributed to fitness in ancestral times. For the time
being, the data support a more modest conclusion: religious thoughts
seem to be an emergent property of our standard cognitive capacities.
<p>Religious concepts and activities hijack our cognitive resources, as
do music, visual art, cuisine, politics, economic institutions and
fashion. This hijacking occurs simply because religion provides some
form of what psychologists would call super stimuli. Just as visual
art is more symmetrical and its colours more saturated than what is
generally found in nature, religious agents are highly simplified
versions of absent human agents, and religious rituals are highly
stylized versions of precautionary procedures. Hijacking also occurs
because religions facilitate the expression of certain behaviours.
This is the case for commitment to a group, which is made all the more
credible when it is phrased as the acceptance of bizarre or non-
obvious beliefs.
<p>We should not try to pinpoint the unique origin of religious belief,
because there is no unique domain for religion in human minds.
Different cognitive systems handle representations of supernatural
agents, of ritualized behaviours, of group commitment and so on, just
as colour and shape are handled by different parts of the visual
system. In other words, what makes a god-concept convincing is not
what makes a ritual intuitively compelling or what makes a moral norm
self-evident. Most modern, organized religions present themselves as a
package that integrates all these disparate elements (ritual,
morality, metaphysics, social identity) into one consistent doctrine
and practice. But this is pure advertising. These domains remain
separated in human cognition. The evidence shows that the mind has no
single belief network, but myriad distinct networks that contribute to
making religious claims quite natural to many people.
<p>The findings emerging from this cognitive-evolutionary approach
challenge two central tenets of most established religions. First, the
notion that their particular creed differs from all other (supposedly
misguided) faiths; second, that it is only because of extraordinary
events or the actual presence of supernatural agents that religious
ideas have taken shape. On the contrary, we now know that all versions
of religion are based on very similar tacit assumptions, and that all
it takes to imagine supernatural agents are normal human minds
processing information in the most natural way.
<p>Knowing, even accepting these conclusions is unlikely to undermine
religious commitment. Some form of religious thinking seems to be the
path of least resistance for our cognitive systems. By contrast,
disbelief is generally the result of deliberate, effortful work
against our natural cognitive dispositions — hardly the easiest
ideology to propagate.
