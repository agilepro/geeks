<h1>Study: Prayer no help to sick</h1>
<b>AILING STRANGERS SHOW NO IMPROVEMENT<br>
By Rob Stein<br>Washington Post</b><br>July 15, 2005<p>
<p><b>WASHINGTON - </b>Praying for sick strangers does not improve
their prospects of recovering, according to a large,
carefully designed study that casts doubt on the widely held
belief that praying for someone can help them heal.
<p>The study of nearly 750 heart patients, one of the most
ambitious attempts to test whether prayer has medicinal
power, showed those who had people praying for them from a
distance, and without their knowledge, were no less likely
to suffer a major complication, end up back in the hospital or die.
<p>While skeptics of prayer welcomed the results, other
researchers questioned the findings, and proponents of
prayer maintained God's influence lies beyond the reach of
scientific validation.
<p>Surveys have shown that millions of Americans routinely
pray for themselves and for others when they or someone they
know is sick. A growing body of evidence has found that
religious people tend to be healthier than average, and that
people who pray when they are ill are likely to fare better
than those who do not. Many researchers think religious
belief and practice can help people by providing social
support and fostering positive emotions, which may produce
beneficial responses by the body.
<p>But the idea that praying for someone else -- even when
they are unaware of it -- can affect a person's health has
been much more controversial. Several studies have purported
to show that such prayer is beneficial, but they have been
criticized as deeply flawed. The debate prompted a spate of
new studies aimed at avoiding those shortcomings, including
the new study, which is the first to test prayer at multiple
centers.
<p>For the Mantra II study, Mitchell Krucoff, a cardiologist
at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C., and his
colleagues designed an experiment involving 748 patients who
underwent treatment at nine hospitals around the country for
heart problems from 1999 to 2002.
<p>The researchers enlisted 12 congregations of various
Christian denominations, Jews, Muslims and Buddhists around
the world to pray for some of the patients, giving them
names, ages and descriptions of the illness. The researchers
then divided the patients into four groups. The first
quarter had people praying for them. The second quarter
received a non-traditional treatment known as music, imagery
and touch (MIT) therapy, which involved breathing
techniques, soothing music, touch and other ways to relieve
stress, such as imagining calming images. The third group
received both prayer and MIT, while the fourth received
nothing.
<p>The researchers followed all the patients for six months
to see which patients suffered serious complications, such
as heart attacks, were re-hospitalized, or died from heart
problems. Overall, there was no difference among the four
groups, the researchers report in Saturday's issue of the
Lancet medical journal.
<p>The researchers acknowledged that it was impossible to
make any firm conclusions because of the difficulty of
studying something like prayer. The study, for example,
could not accurately measure factors as fundamental as the
"dose" of prayer.
<p>"Nobody disputes that religious practices bring comfort
to people in times of illness," said Richard Sloan, a
professor of behavioral medicine at Columbia University in
New York and frequent critic of prayer research.
<p>"The question is, can medicine add anything to that? It
trivializes the religious experience to think you can
subject it to the measurement of science."
