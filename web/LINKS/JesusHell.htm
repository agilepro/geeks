<font size=6>Jesus, Hell, and Morality </font><font size=4>by Mark Thomas</font>

<p>It has been claimed that it wasn't Jesus, but his disciples, who created the idea of
hell.&nbsp; As a Jew, Jesus would have no belief in hell.<p>

Whether Jesus actually existed is highly questionable, with no reliable historical records
proving his existence.&nbsp; For sake of argument, let's assume that he did exist.&nbsp; Since
he never wrote anything (at least that survived), the only way that we can know
what he thought is by what people wrote about what he said.&nbsp; Jesus purportedly said
a lot of things, and many of them were contradictory.&nbsp; This
makes it easier for someone to quote him to back up a particular philosophical position.<p>

I did a little quick research, to determine where in the buybull hell is
mentioned.&nbsp; The Christians make it easy
at <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net">http://bible.gospelcom.net</a>&nbsp; Just type in "hell" and let their
computer search.&nbsp; There were 15 results,
and all were in the New Testament.&nbsp; 14
were in the gospels.&nbsp; 6 referred to
cutting off your own body parts to prevent your going to hell.&nbsp; The results are below.<p>

The Old Testament has no reference to hell; punishment ceased at death.&nbsp;
The New Testament creates the concept of eternal punishment.&nbsp; Jesus may love you,
but if you break his rules (and don’t say you’re sorry) you will get tortured forever.&nbsp;
Of course, if you do say that you’re truly sorry, you will get a clean slate.&nbsp; Even Hitler,
if he had confessed before he died, would get into heaven.&nbsp; See Romans 10:9-10, below.<p>

Also note that the Greek word "doulos" was used in the bible, and it meant "slave."&nbsp; However the
good Christian translators did not like this, so they used euphemisms such as "servant" or "handmaid."&nbsp;
With this in mind, look up "servant, beat".&nbsp; You will find that Jesus (in
Luke 12:42-48, below) supposedly recommended that a servant (slave) should be cut into
pieces, as a punishment for beating other servants (slaves) and getting drunk.&nbsp; Jesus also goes
on to tell when servants (slaves) may be beaten.&nbsp; This only makes sense if these "servants" were actually slaves.<p>

Those who claim that morality comes from God (via the buybull), should take special
note of these lines from Luke.&nbsp; Also,
not once in the entire buybull is slavery condemned, and it is often condoned – even by Jesus.<p>

<p><hr><br><h2>Matthew 5:22</h2>
But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother[ 5:22 Some manuscripts
brother without cause] will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to
his brother, 'Raca,[ 5:22 An Aramaic term of contempt] 'is answerable to the
Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell.

<p><h2>Matthew 5:29</h2>
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for
you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.

<p><h2>Matthew 5:30</h2>
And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better
for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.

<p><h2>Matthew 10:28</h2>
Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul.&nbsp; Rather, be afraid of the One who
can destroy both soul and body in hell.

<p><h2>Matthew 16:18</h2>
And I tell you that you are Peter, [Peter means rock.] and on this rock I will
build my church, and the gates of Hades [Or hell] will not overcome it. [Or not prove stronger than it]

<p><h2>Matthew 18:9</h2>
And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you
to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.

<p><h2>Matthew 23:15</h2>
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land
and sea to win a single convert, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as
much a son of hell as you are."

<p><h2>Matthew 23:33</h2>
"You snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to hell?

<p><h2>Romans 10: 9-10</h2>
That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your
heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.

<p>For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your
mouth that you confess and are saved.

<p><h2>Luke 12:42-48</h2>
The Lord answered, "Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master puts
in charge of his servants to give them their food allowance at the proper time?<br>
It will be good for that servant whom the master finds doing so when he returns.<br>
I tell you the truth, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.<br>
But suppose the servant says to himself, 'My master is taking a long time in
coming,' and he then begins to beat the menservants and maidservants and to eat
and drink and get drunk.<br>
The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an
hour he is not aware of. He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with
the unbelievers.<br>
"That servant who knows his master's will and does not get ready or does not do what
his master wants will be beaten with many blows.<br>
But the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows.
From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one
who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.<p>
