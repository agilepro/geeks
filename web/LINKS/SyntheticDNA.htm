<p>It has been 50 years since scientists first created DNA in a test tube,
stitching ordinary chemical ingredients together to make
life's most extraordinary molecule. Until recently, however,
even the most sophisticated laboratories could make only
small snippets of DNA -- an extra gene or two to be inserted
into corn plants, for example, to help the plants ward off
insects or tolerate drought.
<p>Now researchers are poised to cross a dramatic barrier:
the creation of life forms driven by completely artificial DNA.
<p>Scientists in Maryland have already built the world's
first entirely handcrafted chromosome -- a large looping
strand of DNA made from scratch in a laboratory,
containing all the instructions a microbe needs to live and reproduce.
<p>In the coming year, they hope to transplant it into a
cell, where it is expected to "boot itself up," like
software downloaded from the Internet, and cajole the
waiting cell to do its bidding. And while the first
synthetic chromosome is a plagiarized version of a
natural one, others that code for life forms that have
never existed before are already under construction.
<p>The cobbling together of life from synthetic DNA,
scientists and philosophers agree, will be a watershed
event, blurring the line between biological and
artificial -- and forcing a rethinking of what it means
for a thing to be alive.
<p>"This raises a range of big questions about what
nature is and what it could be," said Paul Rabinow, an
anthropologist at the University of California at
Berkeley who studies science's effects on society.
"Evolutionary processes are no longer seen as sacred or
inviolable. People in labs are figuring them out so they
can improve upon them for different purposes."
<p>That unprecedented degree of control over creation
raises more than philosophical questions, however. What
kinds of organisms will scientists, terrorists and other
creative individuals make? How will these
self-replicating entities be contained? And who might
end up owning the patent rights to the basic tools for
synthesizing life?
<p>Some experts are worried that a few maverick
companies are already gaining monopoly control over the
core "operating system" for artificial life and are
poised to become the Microsofts of synthetic biology.
That could stifle competition, they say, and place
enormous power in a few people's hands.
<p>"We're heading into an era where people will be
writing DNA programs like the early days of computer
programming, but who will own these programs?" asked
Drew Endy, a scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
<p>At the core of synthetic biology's new ascendance are
high-speed DNA synthesizers that can produce very long
strands of genetic material from basic chemical building
blocks: sugars, nitrogen-based compounds and phosphates.
<p>Today a scientist can write a long genetic program on a
computer just as a maestro might compose a musical
score, then use a synthesizer to convert that digital
code into actual DNA. Experiments with "natural" DNA
indicate that when a faux chromosome gets plopped into a
cell, it will be able to direct the destruction of the
cell's old DNA and become its new "brain" -- telling the
cell to start making a valuable chemical, for example,
or a medicine or a toxin, or a bio-based gasoline substitute.
<p>Unlike conventional biotechnology, in which
scientists induce modest genetic changes in cells to
make them serve industrial purposes, synthetic biology
involves the large-scale rewriting of genetic codes to
create metabolic machines with singular purposes.
<p>"I see a cell as a chassis and power
supply for the artificial systems we
are putting together," said Tom
Knight of MIT, who likes to compare
the state of cell biology today to
that of mechanical engineering in
1864. That is when the United States
began to adopt standardized thread
sizes for nuts and bolts, an advance
that allowed the construction of
complex devices from simple,
interchangeable parts.
<p>If biology is to morph into an
engineering discipline, it is going
to need similarly standardized
parts, Knight said. So he and
colleagues have started a collection
of hundreds of interchangeable
genetic components they call
BioBricks, which students and others
are already popping into cells like Lego pieces.
<p>So far, synthetic biology is
still semi-synthetic, involving
single-cell organisms such as
bacteria and yeast that have a
blend of natural and synthetic
DNA. The cells can reproduce, a
defining trait of life. But in
many cases that urge has been
genetically suppressed, along
with other "distracting"
biological functions, to
maximize productivity.
<p>"Most cells go about life
like we do, with the intention
to make more of themselves after
eating," said John Pierce, a
vice president at DuPont in
Wilmington, Del., a leader in
the field. "But what we want
them to do is make stuff we want."
<p>J. Craig Venter, chief
executive of Synthetic Genomics
in Rockville, knows what he
wants his cells to make:
ethanol, hydrogen and other
exotic fuels for vehicles, to
fill a market that has been
estimated to be worth $1 trillion.
<p>In a big step toward that
goal, Venter has now built the
first fully artificial
chromosome, a strand of DNA many
times longer than anything made
by others and laden with all the
genetic components a microbe
needs to get by.
<p>Details of the process are
under wraps until the work is
published, probably early next
year. But Venter has already
shown that he can insert a
"natural" chromosome into a cell
and bring it to life. If a
synthetic chromosome works the
same way, as expected, the first
living cells with fully
artificial genomes could be
growing in dishes by the end of 2008.
<p>The plan is to mass-produce a
plain genetic platform able to
direct the basic functions of
life, then attach
custom-designed DNA modules that
can compel cells to make
synthetic fuels or other products.
<p>It will be a challenge to
cultivate fuel-spewing microbes,
Venter acknowledged. Among other
problems, he said, is that
unless the fuel is constantly
removed, "the bugs will
basically pickle themselves."
<p>But the hurdles are not
insurmountable. LS9 Inc., a
company in San Carlos, Calif.,
is already using E. coli
bacteria that have been
reprogrammed with synthetic DNA
to produce a fuel alternative
from a diet of corn syrup and
sugar cane. So efficient are the
bugs' synthetic metabolisms that
LS9 predicts it will be able to
sell the fuel for just $1.25 a gallon.
<p>At a DuPont plant in Tennessee,
other semi-synthetic bacteria
are living on cornstarch and
making the chemical 1,3 propanediol,
or PDO. Millions of pounds of the stuff
are being spun and woven into high-tech
fabrics (DuPont's chief executive wears a
pinstripe suit made of it), putting
the bug-begotten chemical on track
to become the first $1 billion
biotech product that is not a pharmaceutical.
<p>Engineers at DuPont studied
blueprints of E. coli's metabolism
and used synthetic DNA to help the
bacteria make PDO far more
efficiently than could have
been done with ordinary genetic engineering.

<p>"If you want to sell it at a dollar a gallon . . . you need every bit of efficiency you can
muster," said DuPont's Pierce. "So we're running these bugs to their limits."
<p>Yet another application is in medicine, where synthetic DNA is allowing bacteria and yeast to
produce the malaria drug artemisinin far more efficiently than it is made in plants, its natural source.
<p>Bugs such as these will seem quaint, scientists say, once fully synthetic organisms are brought on line
to work 24/7 on a range of tasks, from industrial production to chemical cleanups. But the prospect of a
flourishing synbio economy has many wondering who will own the valuable rights to that life.
<p>In the past year, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has been flooded with aggressive synthetic-biology
claims. Some of Venter's applications, in particular, "are breathtaking in their scope," said Knight.
And with Venter's company openly hoping to develop "an operating system for biologically-based software,"
some fear it is seeking synthetic hegemony.
<p>"We've asked our patent lawyers to be reasonable and not to be overreaching," Venter said.
But competitors such as DuPont, he said, "have just blanketed the field with patent applications."
<p>Safety concerns also loom large. Already a few scientists have made viruses from scratch. The pending ability
to make bacteria -- which, unlike viruses, can live and reproduce in the environment outside of a living body --
raises new concerns about contamination, contagion and the potential for mischief.
<p>"Ultimately synthetic biology means cheaper and widely accessible tools to build bioweapons, virulent
pathogens and artificial organisms that could pose grave threats to people and the planet," concluded a
recent report by the Ottawa-based ETC Group, one of dozens of advocacy groups that want a ban on releasing
synthetic organisms pending wider societal debate and regulation.
<p>"The danger is not just bio-terror but bio-error," the report says.
<p>Many scientists say the threat has been overblown. Venter notes that his synthetic genomes are spiked with
special genes that make the microbes dependent on a rare nutrient not available in nature. And Pierce, of DuPont,
says the company's bugs are too spoiled to survive outdoors.
<p>"They are designed to grow in a cosseted environment with very high food levels," Pierce said.
"You throw this guy out on the ground, he just can't compete. He's toast."
<p>"We've heard that before," said Jim Thomas, ETC Group's program manager, noting that genes engineered
into crops have often found their way into other plants despite assurances to the contrary. "The fact is, you
can build viruses, and soon bacteria, from downloaded instructions on the Internet," Thomas said. "Where's
the governance and oversight?"
<p>In fact, government controls on trade in dangerous microbes do not apply to the bits of DNA that can be used to
create them. And while some industry groups have talked about policing the field themselves, the technology is quickly
becoming so simple, experts say, that it will not be long before "bio hackers" working in garages will be
downloading genetic programs and making them into novel life forms.
<p>"The cat is out of the bag," said Jay Keasling, chief of synthetic biology at the University of
California at Berkeley.
<p>Andrew Light, an environmental ethicist at the University of Washington in Seattle, said synthetic biology poses a
conundrum because of its double-edged ability to both wreak biological havoc and perhaps wean civilization from dirty
20th-century technologies and petroleum-based fuels.
<p>"For the environmental community, I think this is going to be a really hard choice," Light said.
<p>Depending on how people adjust to the idea of man-made life -- and on how useful the first products prove to be
-- the field could go either way, Light said.
<p>"It could be that synthetic biology is going to be like cellphones: so overwhelming and ubiquitous that no
one notices it anymore. Or it could be like abortion -- the kind of deep disagreement that will not go away."
<p>The question, if the abortion model holds, is which side of the synthetic biology debate will get to call itself "pro-life."</div>
