(H=human, C=chimp, G=Gorilla, O=orangutan)<p>
&nbsp;"Long long ago, in a laboratory far far away, scientists 
figured out that chimpanzees have 24 chromosomes in 
their sperms and eggs, whereas humans only have 23.&nbsp; 
Therefore, these great scientists theorized that two of 
our chromosomes might have fused together sometime in 
the recent past (aka millions of years ago).&nbsp; Their theory 
made 3 predictions:<p>
1) One of our chromosomes would look like two of the 
chimp chromosomes stuck together.<br>
2) This same chromosome would have an extra sequence in 
it that looked like a centromere.&nbsp; Centromeres are the 
things in the middle that microtubules grab onto to 
divide a pair of chromosomes during mitosis.<br>
3) It would also have telomeres (ends) but in the middle 
- and they would be in reverse order.&nbsp; Sort of like this:<p>
ENDchromosomestuffDNEENDchromosomestuffDNE<p>
See the "DNEEND" in the middle?&nbsp; That's what two 
telomeres would look like if two chromosomes were stuck 
together.<p>
As you might have guessed, all three predictions have been 
verified.&nbsp; While, as always, it's impossible to prove that an 
all-powerful being didn't create the evidence to trick us, 
the reasonable explanation is that humans and chimps share a 
common ancestor.</div>
