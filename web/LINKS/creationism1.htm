<p>In a finding that is likely to intensify the debate over what to teach
students about the origins of life, a poll released yesterday found that
nearly two-thirds of Americans say that creationism should be taught alongside
evolution in public schools.
<p>The poll found that 42 percent of respondents held strict creationist
views, agreeing that "living things have existed in their present form
since the beginning of time."
<p>In contrast, 48 percent said they believed that humans had evolved over
time. But of those, 18 percent said that evolution was "guided by a
supreme being," and 26 percent said that evolution occurred through
natural selection. In all, 64 percent said they were open to the idea of
teaching creationism in addition to evolution, while 38 percent favored
replacing evolution with creationism.
<p>The poll was conducted July 7-17 by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public
Life and the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press. The questions
about evolution were asked of 2,000 people. The margin of error was 2.5
percentage points.
<p>John C. Green, a senior fellow at the Pew Forum, said he was surprised to
see that teaching both evolution and creationism was favored not only by
conservative Christians, but also by majorities of secular respondents,
liberal Democrats and those who accept the theory of natural selection. Mr.
Green called it a reflection of "American pragmatism."
<p>"It's like they're saying, 'Some people see it this way, some see it
that way, so just teach it all and let the kids figure it out.' It seems like
a nice compromise, but it infuriates both the creationists and the
scientists," said Mr. Green, who is also a professor at the University of
Akron in <a title="More news and information about Ohio." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/national/usstatesterritoriesandpossessions/ohio/index.html?inline=nyt-geo">Ohio</a>.
<p>Eugenie C. Scott, the director of the National Center for Science Education
and a prominent defender of evolution, said the findings were not surprising
because "Americans react very positively to the fairness or equal time
kind of argument."
<p>"In fact, it's the strongest thing that creationists have got going
for them because their science is dismal," Ms. Scott said. "But they
do have American culture on their side."
<p>This year, the National Center for Science Education has tracked 70 new
controversies over evolution in 26 states, some in school districts, others in
the state legislatures.
<p>President Bush joined the debate on Aug. 2, telling reporters that both
evolution and the theory of intelligent design should be taught in schools
"so people can understand what the debate is about."
<p>Senator Bill Frist of <a title="More news and information about Tennessee." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/national/usstatesterritoriesandpossessions/tennessee/index.html?inline=nyt-geo">Tennessee</a>,
the Republican leader, took the same position a few weeks later.
<p>Intelligent design, a descendant of creationism, is the belief that life is
so intricate that only a supreme being could have designed it.
<p>The poll showed 41 percent of respondents wanted parents to have the
primary say over how evolution is taught, compared with 28 percent who said
teachers and scientists should decide and 21 percent who said school boards
should. Asked whether they believed creationism should be taught instead of
evolution, 38 percent were in favor, and 49 percent were opposed.
<p>More of those who believe in creationism said they were "very
certain" of their views (63 percent), compared with those who believe in
evolution (32 percent).
<p>The poll also asked about religion and politics, government financing of
religious charities, and gay men and lesbians in the military. Most of these
questions were asked of a smaller pool of 1,000 respondents, and the margin of
error was 2.5 percentage points, Pew researchers said.
<p>The public's impression of the Democratic Party has changed in the last
year, the survey found. Only 29 percent of respondents said they viewed
Democrats as being "friendly toward religion," down from 40 percent
in August of 2004. Meanwhile, 55 percent said the Republican Party was
friendly toward religion.
<p>Luis E. Lugo, the director of the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life,
said: "I think this is a continuation of the Republican Party's very
successful use of the values issue in the 2004 election, and the Democrats not
being able up until now to answer that successfully. Some of the more visible
leaders, such as Howard Dean and others, have reinforced that image of a
secular party. Of course, if you look at the Democratic Party, there's a large
religious constituency there."
<p>Survey respondents agreed in nearly equal numbers that nonreligious
liberals had "too much control" over the Democratic Party (44
percent), and that religious conservatives had too much control over the
Republican Party (45 percent).
<p>On religion-based charities, two-thirds of respondents favored allowing
churches and houses of worship to apply for government financing to provide
social services. But support for such financing declined from 75 percent in
early 2001, when Mr. Bush rolled out his religion-based initiative.
<p>On gay men and lesbians in the military, 58 percent of those polled said
they should be allowed to serve openly, a modest increase from 1994, when 52
percent agreed. Strong opposition has fallen in that time, to 15 percent from
26 percent in 1994.
