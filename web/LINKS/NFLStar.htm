CHARLESTON, SC–Washington Redskins defensive end D'Aundré
Banks gave "all thanks and praise to my personal Lord and
Savior Jesus Christ" Monday for giving him the strength he
needed to fatally stab bouncer Isaac Edmonds and
ex-girlfriend Pamela Hamilton outside a Charleston nightclub
early Sunday morning.<p>

<p>"All glory to Jesus," the 25-year-old Banks, who attended
the University of South Carolina, told reporters from his
cell in the Charleston County Jail. "He is with me in this
dark hour, as He was in our devastating 14-13 playoff loss
to the Buccaneers. His love will see me through this."
<p>According to police reports, at approximately 2:30 a.m.,
a visibly intoxicated Banks became involved in an
altercation with Edmonds regarding who would accompany
Hamilton home. When Edmonds attempted to restrain Banks, the
288-pound devout Christian produced a knife and stabbed
Edmonds and Hamilton repeatedly. He then fled to the home of
girlfriend and Hooters waitress Lisa Nolan in nearby
Summerville, where police arrested him several hours later.
<p>"First off, I'd like to say 'great job' to Isaac and
Pamela, who put up a heck of a fight and have nothing to be
ashamed of," Banks said. "They were terrific opponents, and
it's too bad somebody had to lose a life. But the Lord Jesus
Christ was truly with me Saturday night. He guided my hand
when I was able to make that big hit on Isaac, and I really
felt His presence when I stepped up and made that great
slashing cut to bring Pamela down from behind."
<p>Added Banks: "Jesus really let me take this homicide to
the next level. Thank you, Jesus!"
<p>Banks, who has been charged with two counts of
first-degree murder, has been a devout born-again Christian
ever since his hot-tub baptism at the hands of Philadelphia
Eagles wide receiver and ordained minister Irving Fryar
during Pro Bowl week in 1997.<p>

<p>"I was a mess before Jesus took my hand," Banks said. "At
South Carolina, I'd show up late to practice, stay out late
running around with the wrong crowd, all kinds of bad
things. I was about to squander the precious gift of
football God blessed me with. But through His grace, I was
drafted in the fourth round and sent to the NFL to meet Rev.
Fryar, who showed me that Jesus wanted me to glorify Him and
play on His team."
<p>Continued Banks: "D'Aundré Banks' life would be nothing
without Christ's faith. Without His peace and love, D'Aundré
Banks never would have gotten his time in the 40 down to 4.6
for the 1995 NFL scouting combines, and he never would have
had the strength to turn a big guy like Isaac Edmonds around
with just one arm and stab him."
<p>Jeff Rosenzweig, Banks' Miami-based agent and manager,
said his client has been unfairly represented by the media
in its coverage of the double homicide.
<p>"All the papers are branding D'Aundré a murderer, as if
that's all there is to him," Rosenzweig said. "But in their
mad rush to demonize D'Aundré, they neglect to mention his
deep dedication to the D'Aundré Banks Helps Kids Tackle
Drugs For A Loss Foundation and the Big 98 Safety In The End
Zone Safe House For Women. Or, for that matter, that he
acknowledges the workings of Christ in his everyday life.
No, you don't see any of those things mentioned in the
articles about him. It's all 'homicide this' and 'seven-inch
stab wound that.'"
<p>Banks, whose preliminary hearing is scheduled for Feb. 22
in Charleston County Court, said his fate is in Christ's hands.
<p>"I don't know what will happen to me. That's up to the
Lord," Banks said. "The Bible tells us that nothing is done
on this Earth but that is done through God. No
multimillion-dollar contract extension, no game-saving
interception, no acquittal on both counts of first-degree
murder happens without Him."
