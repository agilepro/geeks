<h1>Excited Catholics Already Lining Up For Pope's Funeral</h1>

VATICAN CITY - Their numbers reaching into the
hundreds, excited Catholics are lining up in front of
St. Peter's Basilica in the hopes of scoring a seat
for the upcoming funeral of Pope John Paul II.
<p>&nbsp; Sipping hot cocoa Monday while seated in a
folding chair, Salvatore Bruni, 56, a Florence tailor,
said he has been in line since Feb. 10.<p>

<p>&nbsp; "I don't know how much longer I'll have to wait,
but whether it's five days or five months, it'll be
well worth it," said Bruni from his position near the
front of the queue.&nbsp; "This is going to be a funeral
I'll never forget."
<p>&nbsp; "The pope is a great man who has done wondrous
things for the world," said Seamus O'Halloran, a
Dublin pub owner who missed the Mar. 15 wedding of his
nephew to avoid losing his spot in line.&nbsp; "So to have
a chance to be there when they finally put him in the
ground, man, that's something I'll tell my grandkids
about."
<p>&nbsp; Despite persistent rumors that the pope has
Parkinson's disease, the Vatican continues to deny
that his death is imminent, insisting that the pontiff
is in excellent health for a man his age.
Nevertheless, the line of faithful "Pope
Deathwatchers" that wraps around the cathedral
continues to swell by the hour.
<p>&nbsp; Many of those waiting in line hope to catch a
glimpse of the pope before he dies.
<p>&nbsp; "I'm sure he'd love to come down and talk to us,
but he's probably too weak by this point," said Maria
Tineo, a Venezuelan nun who recently jumped 10 spaces
in line when she correctly spelled the pope's real
name--Karol Joseph Wojtyla--in a contest sponsored by
a Rome radio station.&nbsp; "Some people near the back of
the line thought they saw him on the balcony, but that
turned out to be false."
<p>&nbsp; Though no pope sightings have occurred in the
last few weeks, periodic glimpses of cardinals
entering and exiting St. Peter's have kept the crowd
juiced.
<p>&nbsp; "I've seen Cardinal Sadano twice," said Milan
resident Sofia Cucino, who runs the pope fan site
Johnpaulrules.com.&nbsp; "I also saw Cardinal Grantin once
and wanted to ask him to get the pope to sign my copy
of Crossing The Threshold Of Hope, but I couldn't get
his attention.&nbsp; I just hope it's not my last chance."
<p>&nbsp; While portable radios and TVs keep the crowd up
to date on the pope's health, those in line have
mostly entertained themselves.&nbsp; Among the most popular
ways to pass the time include discussing the revised
criteria for sainthood, trading pope-sighting stories,
singing "Ave Maria," quoting the scripture, playing
Catholic Trivial Pursuit, and, most of all, discussing
the life of Pope John Paul II.
<p>&nbsp; "Pope John Paul II was the first non-Italian
pope in more than 455 years and the first Slavic pope
ever," said William Strand, an Omaha, NE, priest.&nbsp; "He
had to struggle every step of the way, right from his
start as a young priest in the godless, communist
country of Poland.&nbsp; Before he became a priest, he
belonged to an experimental theater troupe, worked as
a stonecutter, and was a published poet.&nbsp; He also
enjoyed mountain climbing and kayaking.&nbsp; He was--I
mean is--truly one of a kind."
<p>&nbsp; While nearly everyone in line intends to wait as
long as it takes until the pope dies, many do not plan
to remain for the naming of a successor.
<p>&nbsp; "I'm here to lend my faith and devotion to a
very holy man in his final days," said Mario Battaglia
of Genoa.&nbsp; "After he departs, so shall I."
<p>&nbsp; For all the faithful's enthusiasm, some
observers say the queued Catholics are wasting their
time, insisting that they will be squeezed out of the
funeral by the countless heads of state and other
dignitaries that will descend upon the Vatican from
around the world.
<p>&nbsp; "When [the pope] dies, it will be an
unbelievable event.&nbsp; Everybody who's anybody will be
there," said Dr. Lawrence Shear, dean of the Yale
School of Divinity.&nbsp; "The media requests alone could
fill that basilica.&nbsp; Since the Vatican is always
looking for the kind of coverage the death of a major
leader brings, the devoted will be out of luck."
<p>&nbsp; Continued Shear: "I think the best those poor
Catholics can hope for is to be interviewed about
their feelings on the pope's passing by local TV news
affiliates while wailing in St. Peter's Square."
