In the short story "Silver Blaze," Sherlock Holmes solves the
 mystery of a stolen racehorse by observing that the stable's guard dog didn't
 bark—hence, the intruder was not a stranger.
 <p>The mystery of whether Richard Clarke is telling the truth about President
 Bush's counterterrorism policies might be solved the same way: Which dogs
 aren't barking? Amid all the administration officials bombarding the airwaves
 with denunciations, who has stayed mum?
 <p>The answer: Secretary of State Colin Powell and CIA Director George Tenet,
 and their silence speaks loudly.
 <p>Tenet is central to Clarke's case that Bush was negligent on terrorism.
 National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice and others have said many
 times—in what they present as a defense against Clarke's charges—that Bush
 received an intelligence briefing from Tenet every morning and was therefore
 well aware of the threat from al-Qaida. But Clarke's point is that Bush didn't
 take Tenet's warnings seriously. Here's a key passage from Clarke's book, <em><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0743260244/qid=1080759860/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-1483431-1491863?v=glance&amp;s=books" target="_blank"><font color="#0066cc">Against All Enemies</font></a></em> (Page 235):
 <blockquote>
 <p>[Tenet] and I regularly commiserated that al Qaeda was not being
 addressed more seriously by the new administration. Sometimes I would walk
 into my office and find the Director of Central Intelligence sitting at my
 desk or the desk of my assistant, Beverly Roundtree, waiting to vent his
 frustration. We agreed that Tenet would ensure that the president's daily
 briefings would continue to be replete with threat information on al Qaeda.
 </blockquote>
 <p>This is where the famous "swatting flies" story appears.
 <blockquote>
 <p>President Bush, reading the intelligence every day and noticing that
 there was a lot about al Qaeda, asked Condi Rice why it was that we couldn't
 stop "swatting flies" and eliminate al Qaeda. Rice told me about
 the conversation and asked how the plan to get al Qaeda was coming in the
 Deputies Committee. "It can be presented to the Principals [the Cabinet
 secretaries] in two days, whenever we can get a meeting," I pressed.
 Rice promised to get to it soon. Time passed.
 </blockquote>
 <p>If Clarke is spewing nonsense—if the president and his national security
 adviser really did consider al-Qaida an urgent matter—Tenet is <em>the</em>
 man to say so. It's hard to imagine that the White House hasn't tried to
 recruit him to do so. Yet so far he hasn't.
 <p>Tenet is not the only quiet dog. One of the hounds that the White House did
 unleash—Secretary of State Powell—not only declined to growl, but
 practically purred like a kitten. Interviewed on Jim Lehrer's <em><a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/white_house/jan-june04/powell_03-26.html" target="_blank"><font color="#0066cc">NewsHour</font></a></em>,
 Powell said: "I know Mr. Clarke. I have known him for many, many years.
 He's a very smart guy. He served his nation very, very well. He's an expert in
 these matters." His book "is not the complete story," but,
 Powell added, "I'm not attributing any bad motives to it."
 <p>Asked if he had been recruited to join the campaign against Clarke, Powell
 replied, "I'm not aware of any campaign against Mr. Clarke, and I am not
 a member."
 <p>His choice of words here is fascinating. Note: He did not say "There <em>is</em>
 no campaign," but rather "I'm <em>not aware</em> of any
 campaign." As has been widely <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2095756/"><font color="#666666">observed</font></a>,
 Powell truly is out of the loop in this administration; it's conceivable he is
 unaware. He then went on to say, "[A]nd I am not a
 member"—suggesting there might <em>be</em> a campaign, but he's not
 part of it.
 <p>It may be a stretch to parse these words so closely. This was an interview,
 after all, not a written statement. Then again, Powell must have given some
 careful thought to what he would say. In any case, his answer doesn't exactly
 amount to a denial of an anti-Clarke campaign. In fact, it's a textbook case
 of the "non-denial denial."
 <p>Powell also circled around an answer when Lehrer asked if Clarke was right
 in saying the Bush administration did not give "urgent priority" to
 fighting al-Qaida. He replied:
 <blockquote>
 <p>We knew that al-Qaeda was a threat to our country. We knew that the
 Clinton Administration understood this and was working against al-Qaeda. We
 did not ignore al-Qaeda. We spent a lot of time thinking about terrorism,
 what should we do about it. … We were working on terrorism and trying to
 understand it.
 </blockquote>
 <p>You don't need to be a literary critic to realize that this is an amazing
 statement. In a few&nbsp; sentences, Powell tells us that <em>Clinton</em>
 "understood" and "was working against" al-Qaida—while
 the Bush administration "<em>did not ignore</em>" al-Qaida (not
 quite the same thing) and "spent a lot of time <em>thinking</em>"
 about it and "<em>trying</em> to understand it."
 <p>In the middle of all this, Powell managed to throw in the following:
 "I met with Mr. Clarke four days after I was named to be the Secretary of
 State." Clarke has said, in his book and in many interviews, that he
 didn't get a chance to brief Bush's Cabinet secretaries on al-Qaida until one
 week before 9/11. In this context, Powell is telling Jim Lehrer that <em>he</em>
 met with Clarke even before the administration got underway.
 <p>Powell's implicit support of Clarke is significant. In his book, Clarke
 portrays Powell as his ally in the administration's internecine disputes over
 terrorism. He writes that when he briefed Bush's transition team in January
 2001, "Colin Powell took the unusual step … of asking to meet with …
 the senior counterterrorism officers from NSC, State, Defense, CIA, FBI, and
 the military. … When we all agreed at the importance of the al Qaeda threat,
 Powell was obviously surprised at the unanimity" (Page 228).
 <p>Three months later, at the first deputies meeting on terrorism, when Paul
 Wolfowitz challenged this view and insisted that Iraq posed the greater
 threat, Clarke writes, "Deputy Secretary of State Rich Armitage came to
 my rescue. 'We agree with Dick. We see al Qaeda as a major threat and
 countering it as an urgent priority.' The briefings of Colin Powell had
 worked" (Page 232).
 <p>Finally, the day after 9/11, when Donald Rumsfeld advocated
 "broadening the objectives of our response and 'getting Iraq,' " it
 was Powell who "pushed back, urging a focus on al Qaeda." Clarke
 writes, "Relieved to have some support, I thanked [Powell and Armitage].
 'I thought I was missing something here,' I vented. 'Having been attacked by
 al Qaeda, for us now to go bombing Iraq in response would be like our invading
 Mexico after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor.' Powell shook his head. 'It's
 not over yet' "<strong> </strong>(Pages 30-31).
 <p>If Powell has any disputes with this account—of his role, his position,
 the positions of Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz, or the conversations he and Armitage
 had with Clarke in January, April, or September 2001—he could have noted
 them in response to several of Lehrer's questions during the <em>NewsHour</em>
 interview. Powell, too, didn't bark.
