<h1>Aging Pope, Just Blessing Everything In Sight</h1>
<br>
VATICAN CITY—Concerned handlers for Pope John Paul II announced Monday that,
in recent weeks, the 78-year-old Catholic leader has "just been blessing
everything in sight."<p>

The frail pope has been confined to bed ever since his Jan. 28 return from North
America.<p>
"We are, of course, very concerned for His Holiness' mental
condition," said chief papal physician Giuseppe Clementi, standing by the
pope's bedside, surrounded by dozens of newly consecrated pill bottles,
urine-specimen cups and orthopedic slippers. "Pretty much anything you hold
up in front of his face these days, he blesses."<p>
Vatican handlers said they first noticed signs of papal deterioration on Jan.
26, as he deplaned at St. Louis' Lambert International Airport upon his arrival
in the U.S. After descending the airplane staircase and kissing the runway, as
is papal tradition, the pope broke free of his handlers and blessed a luggage
cart, a podium, a Life photographer's camera, the plane's left-side landing
gear, three TWA flight attendants, and two of the Swiss Guard who were
attempting to release his grip on the landing struts and subdue him. Upon
realizing that he was being physically restrained, the pope worked his
papal-signet-ring-bearing right hand free and blessed the entire aircraft, which
now resides in its own special five-story grotto under St. Peter's Basilica.<p>
The pope's blessing rampage also necessitated the construction of a
40,000-square-foot reliquary for the storage of thousands of now-holy items.
Housed in the structure are such hallowed objects as the Blessed Vacuum Cleaner
Of St. Matthew, the Consecrated Ball Of Crumpled-Up Paper, and the Sacred Zagnut
Bar Of Christ, which the pope discovered and blessed during his recent U.S.
visit.<p>
