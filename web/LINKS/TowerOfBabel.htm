Robert T. Pennock got his Bachelor's degree as a "joint degree in
biology and philosophy", and his Ph.D in the history and philosophy
of science. I don't have details of his career since; he mentions at
one point teaching seminars in the philosophy of biology. His book
TOWER OF BABEL is written to answer and refute the criticisms of
evolutionary biology that have been made by the "Intelligent Design
Theorists": Philip Johnson, Michael Behe, William Dembski, Stephen
Meyer, and others who seek to challenge "naturalistic science" in
favor of developing "theistic science". His book is primarily about
how science is done and why it is done that way, why evolutionary
biology is a science and "Intelligent Design Theory" is not, what is
the logic and evidence supporting contemporary Darwinism and why the
criticisms of the Creationists fail.<p>

As part of his argument, and as a theme that recurs throughout the
book, Pennock makes an analogy between biological evolution and
linguistic evolution. Languages change over time, in their
pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar, and these changes can be
observed as they happen and documented over centuries in the writings
that have been preserved. (For European languages, one of the best
"document trails" is the different translations of the Bible that
have been made over the centuries.) It is well established, for
example, that the "Romance languages", Portuguese, Spanish, French,
Italian, Romanian, and a few smaller ones that are less well-known,
are all descended from Latin, as it was spoken in the Roman Empire.
While the Roman Empire prevailed, Europe was linked by trade and by
government, and Latin was the common language everywhere. After the
Empire fell and the roads were no longer maintained, Europe broke up
into lots of smaller fiefdoms that were largely self-sufficient, and
the local ways of speaking gradually drifted apart. Over the
centuries they drifted far enough that they were no longer mutually
intelligible; local dialects had become separate languages.<p>

This is a problem for Creationists, because the Bible gives a
different account of the origins of languages. Languages were all
created by God; the first language was given to Adam, and after the
Fall, after the Flood and Noah's Ark, the descendants of Noah settled
in the plain of Shinar and began to build a tower. (Genesis 10 and
11.) Yahveh decides to disrupt this project by changing everybody's
language; since the people could no longer understand each other,
they scattered and settled all over the world, each family/clan/tribe
with their own language. Henry Morris and the Institute for Creation
Research explicitly support this account, and other prominent
Creationists have sometimes let it slip out that they do also.<p>
