<h1>Bush and Science at Loggerheads</h1>
<h2>Barriers to research and claims of suppressed data sully interactions
between researchers and the administration | <a href="mailto:dwilkie@the-scientist.com">By
Dana Wilkie</a></h2>
At the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego, Fred Gage and
colleagues examine how a generic embryonic stem cell evolves into a highly
specialized brain cell. Their hope is that understanding stem-cell evolution
will reveal what keeps cells healthy and lead to new therapies. But federal
restrictions on human embryonic stem-cell research are discouraging Gage and
others. "I would say that I'm limiting my effort in this field," he
says. "It's been time consuming. Resources are taken away from other
things." Human embryonic studies can be conducted only with private money,
creating burdens such as fundraising and setting up a separate lab with new
staff, equipment, and supplies.
<p>President George W. Bush's 2001 limitation on federal funding for embryonic
stem cell research<sup>1</sup> is one of a number of policies that have brought
him into conflict with scientists. Critics claim that the collective impact will
cost the United States its status as the world leader in scientific advancement.
"The level of manipulation by this administration is unprecedented,"
says Representative Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), a ranking member of the House
Government Reform Committee who tried unsuccessfully in May to pass legislation
creating an independent panel to examine the politicization of science.
"Distinguished scientists, scientific organizations, and leading science
journals have objected to this administration's violations of scientific
integrity," he says.
<p><b>COLLECTED CONCERNS </b>Complaints against the administration stem from
its:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Suppressing an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) study that found that
 a Senate bill would do more than a White House-sponsored bill to reduce
 mercury contamination in fish.
 <li>Demanding that EPA remove a section of a report on climate change. This
 came about after administration officials suggested adjustments to emphasize
 the scientific uncertainties, a move that agency scientists resisted.<sup>2</sup>
 <li>Posting information on government Web sites despite objections from the
 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) staff. For example,
 according to former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services
 Patrick Fagan, the National Cancer Institute posted on its Web site that
 there is a link between abortion and breast cancer. The information was
 later removed.
 <li>Placing controversial people in scientific positions. For example, the
 president recommended that the Food and Drug Administration's Reproductive
 Health Advisory Committee be chaired by obstetrician-gynecologist W. David
 Hager, who has written that scripture readings can ease premenstrual
 syndrome. Hager did not become chair, but he was appointed to the panel.
 <li>Stacking scientific advisory panels by eliminating people who supported
 Bush's 2000 election rivals (according to testimony taken during a hearing
 held by Democrats on the House Science Committee), or picking others who
 lacked scientific credentials, but who supported the president's views.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>POLITICAL POSITIONS </b>In February, the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS)--a
group best known for its stands on environmental preservation and nuclear
disarmament--published "Scientific Integrity in Policymaking."<sup>3</sup>
This report examined instances in which scientists claimed that the White House
ignored, suppressed, censored, or distorted either the conclusions of federal
scientists or views that represented a consensus in the scientific community.
<p>While many in the research community are uncomfortable with how the
government uses science, "There's no doubt that every administration has
the right to inject their view of the world into public policy," says Paul
Berg, a Nobel Laureate and Stanford University professor of biochemistry.
"But if the balance is tipped so there is very little exchange or openness,
then society has a right to be suspicious and upset."
<p>With respect to the climate change issue, George Woodwell, director of the
Woods Hole Research Center, claims that the Bush administration "does not
want to hear from the scientists within the government that there is a serious
problem." And the reason for that, he asserts, is "the administration
wishes to perpetuate the fossil-fuel era." He continues: "This means
money for people who have heavy investments in the fossil-fuel business. Those
investments pervade virtually everything."
<p>The Bush administration sees it differently. White House chief science
advisor John Marburger III, himself a scientist, told reporters in May that such
complaints often reflect "a basic disagreement about what you should
do," rather than an intent to manipulate scientific facts. "A lot of
these areas are controversial areas," says Marburger, who in early April
released a point-by-point response<sup>4</sup> dismissing the UCS' complaints.
"The president really likes to know exactly what science is saying."
<p>However, critics claim that the administration distorts scientific findings
so that the White House can draw public-policy conclusions in line with
conservative voters; hence the position on emphasizing sexual abstinence,
resistance to abortion, and opposition to embryonic stem-cell research. For
example, the UCS report said that at the urging of Bush staff, the CDC changed
information on its Web site that said condoms were 80%-90% effective in
preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS. The new information emphasizes abstinence.
<p>Judy Auerrbach, a vice president at the American Foundation for AIDS
Research, said the 80%-90% figure came from the Cochrane Collaboration's
database of systematic review. The well-respected organization pools research on
scientific issues and publishes consensus opinions. "If a credible
scientific group concludes that condoms are 85% effective," says Auerrbach,
"then the public health [consensus] is that condoms are 85%
effective." She adds, "The White House and abstinence supporters
exaggerated the 15% [failure rate], and said it's dangerous to tell people to
use condoms." Marburger, in response, says it is common for federal
agencies to periodically evaluate and revise fact sheets on their Web sites.
<p>In February, the White House abruptly dismissed Elizabeth Blackburn and
William May from the President's Council on Bioethics, which advises on
stem-cell research. Both disagreed with the president's 2001 prohibition on
federally funded research that uses human embryonic stem cells. Critics claim
that the council replacements were people who tend to support the prohibition.
However, according to Peter Lawler, chairman of Berry College's department of
government and international studies and a replacement for one of the open
council positions, committee chairman Leon Kass never asked him about his views
on stem-cell research. Blackburn, a biochemist at University of California, San
Francisco, said she fruitlessly urged Kass to balance reports with opinions from
the nation's leading experts in stem-cell research. "I think [Kass] wanted
certain arguments to be made in the report, and the [scientific] facts were
inconvenient for that argument, but you have to get the science right," she
says.
<p>The recent death of former president Ronald Reagan, who had Alzheimer
disease, has pushed the issue of stem-cell prohibitions to the fore. Former
first lady Nancy Reagan advocates fewer restrictions on stem-cell research, as
has a large group of senators that includes notable conservatives such as Orrin
Hatch (R-Utah). So far, though, efforts to loosen restrictions on stem-cell
research have met with failure.
<p>There is little sign of détente breaking out. In April, a report from the
General Accounting Office (GAO) concluded that the federal government could give
better direction to federal agencies on creating panels that would be
"perceived as balanced."<sup>5</sup> Democrats demanded a
congressional hearing on this report, but committee chairman Sherwood Boehlert
(R-NY), refused to hold one. "What we're dealing with here is whether open,
balanced, and objective scientific information is being made available to
policymakers and to the public," said Representative Brian Baird (D-Wash.)
who may write legislation to enact some of the GAO's suggestions. A spokesman
for Boehlert, by contrast, said: "It's the position of this committee that
the [Union of Concerned Scientists] report is a political document, and
political rhetoric has no value to the committee, or to science."
<p>The upshot could be damage to the US biotechnology industry and the nation's
reputation and dominance in the biological sciences. <i>The New York Times </i>reported
in May that the United States is losing its dominance in crucial areas of
science, citing evidence such as reversals in Americans' share of prizes and
publications in major professional journals.<sup>6</sup>
