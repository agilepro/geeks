<p>What? Now <i>you've</i> opened up your soul to Him
and made a home for the Lord in <i>your</i> heart, too? Give me a break, Matt.
You're just saying that because I told you <i>I'd</i> been born again into new
life in the love and grace of our Lord, the Redeemer, Christ Jesus. Let's get
one thing clear: Jesus is <i>my </i>personal savior, not yours. I don't want
you horning in on my eternal-salvation action.
<p>Get your own Redeemer, Matt. I have a one-on-one,
personal relationship with Jesus, and I don't remember inviting you in on it.
Yes, I know, Jesus said the apostles should spread the good news of His death
and resurrection, and his followers should "go forth and do
likewise." <i>Hello</i>, I'm the one who told <i>you</i> that, remember?
But just because I happen to have proselytized unto you on His behalf, that
doesn't mean I welcomed you into the fold or expected you to embrace the one
true Messiah. I was only saying that stuff out of devotion to His teachings,
not because I wanted you to get with God, too. 
<p><i>I</i> was the one who found that little cartoon pamphlet on the ground.<i> I</i> was the one
who looked into my soul and realized that I'd been living a lie spun by the
great deceiver. <i>I </i>was the one who got down on my hands and knees, right
there in the bus shelter, and accepted the Lord Jesus Christ into my heart—not
you. <i>I</i> broke the bonds of sin and was reborn into a new and beautiful
world of eternal life, man! And now, you want to get some of my eternal life
after death for yourself.
<p>You're lucky I've devoted myself to the worship of
a forgiving and benevolent messianic figure, or else I'd seriously want to pop
you one right now.
<p>Spare me the rhetoric about loving kindness,
turning the other cheek, and "all are welcome at the table of the
Lord." This isn't about that, Matt, and you know it. This is about me
finding something really great, and then you swooping in from outside to take
my cool new personal Savior and claim Him for yourself.
<p>Remember when I got into Linkin Park? That's
right, I saw the video for "One Step Closer" on MTV. You said they
were a one-hit wonder, but I stood behind them. Then you bought <i>Hybrid
Theory</i> and started acting like you'd been a big fan all along. 
<p>Or what about Owen Wilson? I was all into him
after <i>Bottle Rocket</i>. I said he was a real talent with the potential to
be a big star. Then <i>Shanghai Noon</i> comes out, and there's Matt, jumping
on the Owen Wilson bandwagon, waving the Owen Wilson flag! 
<p>And don't give me that "Judge not lest ye be
judged" crap. Jesus may be an all-compassionate avatar of God's divine
forgiveness, but just because I've chosen Him as my personal Savior, that
doesn't mean I'm obliged to let you walk all over me. I don't need you coming
in here with your "Jesus accepts all into His all-forgiving bosom, even
the sinners, tax collectors, and whores, so why not old Matt?" crap. Don't
start going off on <i>me </i>about Christ's repudiations of the exclusionary
doctrines of the Pharisees, okay? If it weren't for me, you wouldn't even know
the word "Pharisee."
<p>No, Matt, because you don't come up with your own
ideas. You just latch on to stuff that other people already like and leech off
them like a parasite. Man, if it weren't for that "love your enemies as
yourself" doctrine and the whole bit about fellowship and stewardship of
God's Kingdom on Earth, I'd be just about through with you.
<p>Okay, fine. Jesus is <i>your</i> personal savior.
Congratulations! Matt's found eternal bliss in the afterlife, everybody! He's a
big man! Go ahead—enjoy worshipping your newfound Messiah all you want. I'm
moving on. From now on, Jesus is no longer my own personal Savior. You can have
Him all to yourself. I'm leaving behind selflessness and forgiveness and
individual sacrifice for the greater good, and I'm finding something else to
center my universe on. 
<p>From now on, I'm devoting myself, heart and soul,
to cool old sports cars. And I don't want to see you in six months talking
about how awesome the '63 Corvette is, either. Collectible '60s sports cars are
for me only. Got it? Good. Now, go and enjoy your transubstantiation of bread
and wine into the body and blood of the Lord in the holy sacrament of Communion
and leave me alone.
<p>What's that? Oh, I'm being an asshole about it, am
I? Thou sayest, motherfucker. <i>Thou sayest.</i>
