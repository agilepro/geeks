<p><h1>Evolution 101</h1>
<h3>The Definition:</h3>
Biological evolution, simply put, is descent with modification. This<br>
definition encompasses small-scale evolution (changes in gene frequency in a<br>
population from one generation to the next) and large-scale evolution (the<br>
descent of different species from a common ancestor over many generations).<br>
Evolution helps us to understand the history of life.<br>
<h3>The Explanation:</h3>
Biological evolution is not simply a matter of change over time. Lots of<br>
things change over time: trees lose their leaves, mountain ranges rise and<br>
erode, but they aren't examples of biological evolution because they don't<br>
involve descent through genetic inheritance.<p>
The central idea of biological evolution is that all life on Earth shares a<br>
common ancestor, just as you and your cousins share a common grandmother.<p>
Through the process of descent with modification, the common ancestor of<br>
life on Earth gave rise to the fantastic diversity that we see documented in<br>
the fossil record and around us today. Evolution means that we're all<br>
distant cousins: humans and oak trees, hummingbirds and whales.<br>
<h3>Mechanisms: The Processes of Evolution</h3>
Evolution is the process by which modern organisms have descended from<br>
ancient ancestors. Evolution is responsible for both the remarkable<br>
similarities we see across all life and the amazing diversity of that<br>
life—but exactly how does it work?<p>
Fundamental to the process is genetic variation upon which selective forces<br>
can act in order for evolution to occur. This section examines the<br>
mechanisms of evolution focusing on:<p>
- *Descent* and the genetic differences that are heritable and passed<br>
on to the next generation;<br>
- Mutation, migration (gene flow), genetic drift, and natural<br>
selection as *mechanisms of change*;<br>
- The importance of *genetic variation*;<br>
- The random nature of *genetic drift* and the effects of a reduction<br>
in genetic variation;<br>
- How variation, differential reproduction, and heredity result in<br>
evolution by *natural selection*; and<br>
- How different species can affect each other's evolution through *<br>
coevolution*.<br>
<h3>Descent with Modification</h3>
We've defined evolution as descent with modification from a common ancestor,<br>
but exactly what has been modified? Evolution only occurs when there is a<br>
change in gene frequency within a population over time. These genetic<br>
differences are heritable and can be passed on to the next generation—which<br>
is what really matters in evolution: long term change.<p>
Compare these two examples of change in beetle populations. Which one is an<br>
example of evolution?<br>
</h3>Beetles on a diet</h3>
Imagine a year or two of drought in which there are few plants that these<br>
beetles can eat.<p>
All the beetles have the same chances of survival and reproduction, but<br>
because of food restrictions, the beetles in the population are a little<br>
smaller than the preceding generation of beetles.<p>
Beetles of a different color<br>
Most of the beetles in the population (say 90%) have the genes for bright<br>
green coloration and a few of them (10%) have a gene that makes them more<br>
brown.<p>
Some number of generations later, things have changed: brown beetles are<br>
more common than they used to be and make up 70% of the population.<p>
Which example illustrates descent with modification—a change in gene<br>
frequency over time?<p>
The difference in weight in example 1 came about because of environmental<br>
influences—the low food supply—not because of a change in the frequency of<br>
genes. Therefore, example 1 is not evolution. Because the small body size in<br>
this population was not genetically determined, this generation of<br>
small-bodied beetles will produce beetles that will grow to normal size if<br>
they have a normal food supply.<p>
The changing color in example 2 is definitely evolution: these two<br>
generations of the same population are genetically different. But how did it<br>
happen?<br>

<h2>Mechanisms of Change</h2>
Each of these four processes is a basic mechanism of evolutionary change.<br>
<h3>*Mutation*</h3>
A mutation could cause parents with genes for bright green coloration to<br>
have offspring with a gene for brown coloration. That would make the genes<br>
for brown beetles more frequent in the population.<br>
<h3>*Migration*</h3>
Some individuals from a population of brown beetles might have joined a<br>
population of green beetles. That would make the genes for brown beetles<br>
more frequent in the green beetle population.<br>
<h3>*Genetic Drift*</h3>
Imagine that in one generation, two brown beetles happened to have four<br>
offspring survive to reproduce. Several green beetles were killed when<br>
someone stepped on them and had no offspring. The next generation would have<br>
a few more brown beetles than the previous generation—but just by chance.<br>
These chance changes from generation to generation are known as genetic<br>
drift.<br>
<h3>*Natural Selection*</h3>
Imagine that green beetles are easier for birds to spot (and hence, eat).<br>
Brown beetles are a little more likely to survive to produce offspring. They<br>
pass their genes for brown coloration on to their offspring. So in the next<br>
generation, brown beetles are more common than in the previous generation.<p>
All of these mechanisms can cause changes in the frequencies of genes in<br>
populations, and so all of them are mechanisms of evolutionary change.<br>
However, natural selection and genetic drift cannot operate unless there is<br>
*genetic variation*—that is, unless some individuals are genetically<br>
different from others. If the population of beetles were 100% green,<br>
selection and drift would not have any effect because their genetic make-up<br>
could not change.<p>
So, what are the sources of genetic variation?<br>
<h3>Genetic Variation</h3>
Without genetic variation, some of the basic mechanisms of evolutionary<br>
change cannot operate.<p>
There are three primary sources of genetic variation, which we will learn<br>
more about:<p>
1. *Mutations* are changes in the DNA. A single mutation can have a<br>
large effect, but in many cases, evolutionary change is based on the<br>
accumulation of many mutations.<br>
2. *Gene flow *is any movement of genes from one population to another<br>
and is an important source of genetic variation.<br>
3. *Sex* can introduce new gene combinations into a population. This<br>
genetic shuffling is another important source of genetic variation.<br>
<h2>Mutations</h2>
Mutation is a change in DNA, the hereditary material of life. An organism's<br>
DNA affects how it looks, how it behaves, and its physiology—all aspects of<br>
its life. So a change in an organism's DNA can cause changes in all aspects<br>
of its life.<br>
<h3>*Mutations are random.*</h3>
Mutations can be beneficial, neutral, or harmful for the organism, but<br>
mutations do not "try" to supply what the organism "needs." In this respect,<br>
mutations are random —whether a particular mutation happens or not is<br>
unrelated to how useful that mutation would be.<br>
<h3>*Not all mutations matter to evolution.*</h3>
Since all cells in our body contain DNA, there are lots of places for<br>
mutations to occur; however, not all mutations matter for evolution. *Somatic<br>
mutations* occur in non-reproductive cells and won't be passed onto offspring.<p>
The only mutations that matter to large-scale evolution are those that can<br>
be passed on to offspring. These occur in reproductive cells like eggs and<br>
sperm and are called germ line mutations.<br>
A single germ line mutation can have a range of effects:<p>
1. *No change occurs in phenotype.<br>
*You've probably heard of "junk DNA," DNA that doesn't seem to do<br>
anything. Mutations in junk DNA get passed on to offspring, but as far as we<br>
know, have no obvious effect on the phenotype.<br>
**<br>
2. *Small change occurs in phenotype.<br>
*A single mutation caused this cat's ears to curl backwards slightly.<br>
**<br>
3. *Big change occurs in phenotype.<br>
*Some really important phenotypic changes, like DDT resistance in<br>
insects are sometimes caused by single mutations. A single mutation can also<br>
have strong negative effects for the organism. Mutations that cause the<br>
death of an organism are called lethals—and it doesn't get more negative<br>
than that.<p>
There are some sorts of changes that a single mutation, or even a lot of<br>
mutations, could not cause. Neither mutations nor wishful thinking will make<br>
pigs have wings; only pop culture could have created Teenage Mutant Ninja<br>
Turtles—mutations could not have done it.<br>
<h3>The Causes of Mutations</h3>
Mutations happen for several reasons.<p>
1. *DNA fails to copy accurately.*<br>
Most of the mutations that we think matter to evolution are<br>
"naturally-occurring." For example, when a cell divides, it makes a copy of<br>
its DNA—and sometimes the copy is not quite perfect. That small difference<br>
from the original DNA sequence is a mutation.<br>
2. *External influences can create mutations*.<br>
Mutations can also be caused by exposure to specific chemicals or<br>
radiation. These agents cause the DNA to break down. This is not necessarily<br>
unnatural—even in the most isolated and pristine environments, DNA breaks<br>
down.<p>
Nevertheless, when the cell repairs the DNA, it might not do a perfect job<br>
of the repair. So the cell would end up with DNA slightly different than the<br>
original DNA and hence, a mutation.<br>
<h3>Gene Flow</h3>
*Gene flow*—also called migration—is any movement of genes from one<br>
population to another. Gene flow includes lots of different kinds of events,<br>
such as pollen being blown to a new destination or people moving to new<br>
cities or countries. If genes are carried to a population where those genes<br>
previously did not exist, gene flow can be a very important source of<br>
genetic variation. In the graphic below, the gene for brown coloration moves<br>
from one population to another.<br>
<h3>Sex and Genetic Shuffling</h3>
*Sex* can introduce new gene combinations into a population and is an<br>
important source of genetic variation.<p>
You probably know from experience that siblings are not genetically<br>
identical to their parents or to each other (except, of course, for<br>
identical twins). That's because when organisms reproduce sexually, some<br>
genetic "shuffling" occurs, bringing together new combinations of genes. For<br>
example, you might have bushy eyebrows and a big nose since your mom had<br>
genes associated with bushy eyebrows and your dad had genes associated with<br>
a big nose. These combinations can be good, bad, or neutral. If your spouse<br>
is wild about the bushy eyebrows/big nose combination, you were lucky and<br>
hit on a winning combination!<p>
This shuffling is important for evolution because it can introduce new<br>
combinations of genes every generation. However, it can also break up "good"<br>
combinations of genes.<br>
<h3>Development</h3>
*Development* is the process through which an embryo becomes an adult<br>
organism and eventually dies. Through development, an organism's genotype is<br>
expressed as a phenotype , exposing genes to the action of natural<br>
selection.<p>
Studies of development are important to evolutionary biology for several<br>
reasons:<br>
<h3>- *Explaining major evolutionary change*</h3>
Changes in the genes controlling development can have major effects on<br>
the morphology of the adult organism. Because these effects are so<br>
significant, scientists suspect that changes in developmental genes have<br>
helped bring about large-scale evolutionary transformations. Developmental<br>
changes may help explain, for example, how some hoofed mammals evolved into<br>
ocean-dwellers, how water plants invaded the land, and how small, armored<br>
invertebrates evolved wings.
<h3>- *Learning about evolutionary history *</h3>
An organism's development may contain clues about its history that<br>
biologists can use to build evolutionary trees.<br>
<h3>- *Limiting evolutionary change*</h3>
Developmental processes may constrain evolution, preventing certain<br>
characters from evolving in certain lineages. For example, development may<br>
help explain why there are no truly six-fingered tetrapods.<br>
<h3>*Genetic Drift*</h3>
*Genetic drift*—along with natural selection, mutation, and migration—is one<br>
of the basic mechanisms of evolution.<p>
In each generation, some individuals may, just by chance, leave behind a few<br>
more descendents (and genes, of course!) than other individuals. The genes<br>
of the next generation will be the genes of the "lucky" individuals, not<br>
necessarily the healthier or "better" individuals. That, in a nutshell, is<br>
genetic drift. It happens to ALL populations—there's no avoiding the<br>
vagaries of chance.<p>
Genetic drift affects the genetic makeup of the population but, unlike<br>
natural selection, through an entirely random process. So although genetic<br>
drift is a mechanism of evolution, it doesn't work to produce adaptations.<br>
<h3>Natural Selection</h3>
Natural selection is one of the basic mechanisms of evolution, along with<br>
mutation, migration, and genetic drift.<p>
Darwin's grand idea of evolution by natural selection is relatively simple<br>
but often misunderstood. To find out how it works, imagine a population of<br>
beetles.<p>
1. *There is variation in traits.*<br>
For example, some beetles are green and some are brown.<br>
2. *There is differential reproduction.*<br>
Since the environment can't support unlimited population growth, not<br>
all individuals get to reproduce to their full potential. In this example,<br>
green beetles tend to get eaten by birds and survive to reproduce less often<br>
than brown beetles do.<br>
3. *There is heredity.*<br>
The surviving brown beetles have brown baby beetles because this trait<br>
has a genetic basis.<br>
4. *End result:*<br>
The more advantageous trait, brown coloration, which allows the beetle<br>
to have more offspring, becomes more common in the population. If this<br>
process continues, eventually, all individuals in the population will be<br>
brown. If you have variation, differential reproduction, and heredity, you<br>
will have evolution by natural selection as an outcome. It is as simple as<br>
that.<br>
<h3>Natural Selection at Work</h3>
Scientists have worked out many examples of *natural selection*, one of the<br>
basic mechanisms of evolution.<p>
Any coffee table book about natural history will overwhelm you with<br>
full-page glossies depicting amazing adaptations produced by natural<br>
selection, such as examples like these: Orchids fool wasps into "mating"<br>
with them; Katydids have camouflage to look like leaves; Non-poisonous king<br>
snakes mimic poisonous coral snakes.<p>
Behavior can also be shaped by natural selection. Behaviors such as birds'<br>
mating rituals, bees' wiggle dance, and humans' capacity to learn language<br>
also have genetic components and are subject to natural selection. The male<br>
blue-footed booby, for example, exaggerates his foot movements to attract a<br>
mate.<p>
In some cases, we can directly observe natural selection. Very convincing<br>
data show that the shape of finches' beaks on the Galapagos Islands has<br>
tracked weather patterns: after droughts, the finch population has deeper,<br>
stronger beaks that let them eat tougher seeds.<p>
In other cases, human activity has led to environmental changes that have<br>
caused populations to evolve through natural selection. A striking example<br>
is that of the population of dark moths in the 19th century in England,<br>
which rose and fell in parallel to industrial pollution. These changes can<br>
often be observed and documented.<br>
<h3>What about Fitness?</h3>
Biologists use the word fitness to describe how good a particular genotype<br>
is at leaving offspring in the next generation relative to how good other<br>
genotypes are at it. So if brown beetles consistently leave more offspring<br>
than green beetles because of their color, you'd say that the brown beetles<br>
had a higher fitness.<p>
The brown beetles have a greater fitness relative to the green beetles.<p>
Of course, fitness is a relative thing. A genotype's fitness depends on the<br>
environment in which the organism lives. The fittest genotype during an ice<br>
age, for example, is probably not the fittest genotype once the ice age is<br>
over.<p>
Fitness is a handy concept because it lumps everything that matters to<br>
natural selection (survival, mate-finding, reproduction) into one idea. The<br>
fittest individual is not necessarily the strongest, fastest, or biggest. A<br>
genotype's fitness includes its ability to survive, find a mate, produce<br>
offspring—and ultimately leave its genes in the next generation.<p>
Caring for your offspring and producing thousands of young—many of whom<br>
won't survive, and sporting fancy feathers that attract females are a burden<br>
to the health and survival of the parent. These strategies do, however,<br>
increase fitness because they help the parents get more of their offspring<br>
into the next generation.<p>
It might be tempting to think of natural selection acting exclusively on<br>
survival ability—but, as the concept of fitness shows, that's only half the<br>
story. When natural selection acts on mate-finding and reproductive<br>
behavior, biologists call it sexual selection.<br>
<h3>Sexual Selection</h3>
Sexual selection is a "special case" of natural selection. Sexual selection<br>
acts on an organism's ability to obtain (often by any means necessary!) or<br>
successfully copulate with a mate.<p>
Selection makes many organisms go to extreme lengths for sex: peacocks<br>
maintain elaborate tails, elephant seals fight over territories, fruit flies<br>
perform dances, and some species deliver persuasive gifts. After all, what<br>
female Mormon cricket could resist the gift of a juicy sperm-packet? Going<br>
to even more extreme lengths, the male redback spider literally flings<br>
itself into the jaws of death in order to mate successfully.<p>
Sexual selection is often powerful enough to produce features that are<br>
harmful to the individual's survival. For example, extravagant and colorful<br>
tail feathers or fins are likely to attract predators as well as interested<br>
members of the opposite sex.<p>
It's clear why sexual selection is so powerful when you consider what<br>
happens to the genes of an individual who lives to a ripe old age but never<br>
got to mate: no offspring means no genes in the next generation, which means<br>
that all those genes for living to a ripe old age don't get passed on to<br>
anyone! That individual's fitness is zero.<br>
<h3>Selection is a two-way street.</h3>
Sexual selection usually works in two ways, although in some cases we do see<br>
sex role reversals:<p>
- *Male competition*<br>
Males compete for access to females, the amount of time spent mating<br>
with females, and even whose sperm gets to fertilize her eggs. For example,<br>
male damselflies scrub rival sperm out of the female reproductive tract when<br>
mating.<br>
- *Female choice*<br>
Females choose which males to mate with, how long to mate, and even<br>
whose sperm will fertilize her eggs. Some females can eject sperm from an<br>
undesirable mate.<br>
<h3>Artificial Selection</h3>
Long before Darwin and Wallace, farmers and breeders were using the idea of<br>
selection to cause major changes in the features of their plants and animals<br>
over the course of decades. Farmers and breeders allowed only the plants and<br>
animals with desirable characteristics to reproduce, causing the evolution<br>
of farm stock. This process is called artificial selection because people<br>
(instead of nature) select which organisms get to reproduce.<p>
Farmers have cultivated numerous popular crops from the wild mustard, by<br>
artificially selecting for certain attributes.<p>
These common vegetables were cultivated from forms of wild mustard. This is<br>
evolution through artificial selection.<br>
<h3>Adaptation</h3>
An adaptation is a feature that is common in a population because it<br>
provides some improved function. Adaptations are well fitted to their<br>
function and are produced by natural selection.<p>
Adaptations can take many forms: a behavior that allows better evasion of<br>
predators, a protein that functions better at body temperature, or an<br>
anatomical feature that allows the organism to access a valuable new<br>
resource—all of these might be adaptations. Many of the things that impress<br>
us most in nature are thought to be adaptations.<p>
Mimicry of leaves by insects is an adaptation for evading predators.<p>
The creosote bush is a desert-dwelling plant that produces toxins that<br>
prevent other plants from growing nearby, thus reducing competition for<br>
nutrients and water.<p>
Echolocation in bats is an adaptation for catching insects.<p>
So what's not an adaptation? The answer: a lot of things. One example is<br>
vestigial structures. A vestigial structure is a feature that was an<br>
adaptation for the organism's ancestor, but that evolved to be<br>
non-functional because the organism's environment changed.<p>
Fish species that live in completely dark caves have vestigial,<br>
non-functional eyes. When their sighted ancestors ended up living in caves,<br>
there was no longer any natural selection that maintained the function of<br>
the fishes' eyes. So, fish with better sight no longer out-competed fish<br>
with worse sight. Today, these fish still have eyes—but they are not<br>
functional and are not an adaptation; they are just the by-products of the<br>
fishes' evolutionary history.<p>
In fact, biologists have a lot to say about what is and is not an<br>
adaptation.<br>
<h3>Misconceptions about Natural Selection</h3>
Because natural selection can produce amazing adaptations, it's tempting to<br>
think of it as an all-powerful force, urging organisms on, constantly<br>
pushing them in the direction of progress—but this is not what natural<br>
selection is like at all.<p>
First, natural selection is not all-powerful; it does not produce<br>
perfection. If your genes are "good enough," you'll get some offspring into<br>
the next generation—you don't have to be perfect. This should be pretty<br>
clear just by looking at the populations around us: people may have genes<br>
for genetic diseases, plants may not have the genes to survive a drought, a<br>
predator may not be quite fast enough to catch her prey every time she is<br>
hungry. No population or organism is perfectly adapted.<p>
Second, it's more accurate to think of natural selection as a process rather<br>
than as a guiding hand. Natural selection is the simple result of variation,<br>
differential reproduction, and heredity—it is mindless and mechanistic. It<br>
has no goals; it's not striving to produce "progress" or a balanced<br>
ecosystem. Evolution does not work in this way.<p>
This is why "need," "try," and "want" are not very accurate words when it<br>
comes to explaining evolution. The population or individual does not "want"<br>
or "try" to evolve, and natural selection cannot try to supply what an<br>
organism "needs." Natural selection just selects among whatever variations<br>
exist in the population. The result is evolution.<p>
At the opposite end scale, natural selection is sometimes interpreted as a<br>
random process. This is also a misconception. The genetic variation that<br>
occurs in a population because of mutation is random-but selection acts on<br>
that variation in a very non-random way: genetic variants that aid survival<br>
and reproduction are much more likely to become common than variants that<br>
don't. Natural selection is NOT random!<br>
<h3>Coevolution</h3>
The term coevolution is used to describe cases where two (or more) species<br>
reciprocally affect each other's evolution. So for example, an evolutionary<br>
change in the morphology of a plant, might affect the morphology of an<br>
herbivore that eats the plant, which in turn might affect the evolution of<br>
the plant, which might affect the evolution of the herbivore...and so on.<p>
Coevolution is likely to happen when different species have close ecological<br>
interactions with one another. These ecological relationships include:<p>
1. Predator/prey and parasite/host<br>
2. Competitive species<br>
3. Mutualistic species<p>
Plants and insects represent a classic case of coevolution—one that is<br>
often, but not always, mutualistic. Many plants and their pollinators are so<br>
reliant on one another and their relationships are so exclusive that<br>
biologists have good reason to think that the "match" between the two is the<br>
result of a coevolutionary process.<p>
But we can see exclusive "matches" between plants and insects even when<br>
pollination is not involved. Some Central American Acacia species have<br>
hollow thorns and pores at the bases of their leaves that secrete nectar.<br>
These hollow thorns are the exclusive nest-site of some species of ant that<br>
drink the nectar. But the ants are not just taking advantage of the<br>
plant—they also defend their acacia plant against herbivores.<p>
This system is probably the product of coevolution: the plants would not<br>
have evolved hollow thorns or nectar pores unless their evolution had been<br>
affected by the ants, and the ants would not have evolved herbivore defense<br>
behaviors unless their evolution had been affected by the plants.<p>
<h2>Microevolution</h2>
House sparrows have adapted to the climate of North America, mosquitoes have<br>
evolved in response to global warming, and insects have evolved resistance<br>
to our pesticides. These are all examples of microevolution—evolution on a<br>
small scale.<p>
Here, you can explore the topic of microevolution through several case<br>
studies in which we've directly observed its action.<p>
We can begin with an exact definition.<br>
<h3>Defining Microevolution</h3>
Microevolution is evolution on a small scale—within a single population.<br>
That means narrowing our focus to one branch of the tree of life.<p>
If you could zoom in on one branch of the tree of life scale—the insects,<br>
for example—you would see another phylogeny relating all the different<br>
insect lineages. If you continue to zoom in, selecting the branch<br>
representing beetles, you would see another phylogeny relating different<br>
beetle species. You could continue zooming in until you saw the<br>
relationships between beetle populations.<p>
But how do you know when you've gotten to the population level?<br>
<h3>Defining populations</h3>
For animals, it's fairly easy to decide what a population is. It is a group<br>
of organisms that interbreed with each other—that is, they all share a gene<br>
pool. So for our species of beetle, that might be a group of individuals<br>
that all live on a particular mountaintop and are potential mates for one<br>
another.<p>
The potential to interbreed in nature defines the boundaries of a<br>
population.<p>
Biologists who study evolution at this level define evolution as a change in<br>
gene frequency within a population.<br>
<h3>Detecting Microevolutionary Change</h3>
We've defined microevolution as a change in gene frequency in a population<br>
and a population as a group of organisms that share a common gene pool—like<br>
all the individuals of one beetle species living on a particular<br>
mountaintop.<p>
Imagine that you go to the mountaintop this year, sample these beetles, and<br>
determine that 80% of the genes in the population are for green coloration<br>
and 20% of them are for brown coloration. You go back the next year, repeat<br>
the procedure, and find a new ratio: 60% green genes to 40% brown genes.<p>
You have detected a microevolutionary pattern: a change in gene frequency. A<br>
change in gene frequency over time means that the population has evolved.<p>
The big question is, how did it happen?<br>
<h3>Mechanisms of Microevolution</h3>
There are a few basic ways in which microevolutionary change happens.<br>
Mutation, migration, genetic drift, and natural selection are all processes<br>
that can directly affect gene frequencies in a population.<p>
Imagine that you observe an increase in the frequency of brown coloration<br>
genes and a decrease in the frequency of green coloration genes in a beetle<br>
population. Any combination of the mechanisms of microevolution might be<br>
responsible for the pattern, and part of the scientist's job is to figure<br>
out which of these mechanisms caused the change:<p>
*Mutation*: Some "green genes" randomly mutated to "brown genes" (although<br>
since any particular mutation is rare, this process alone cannot account for<br>
a big change in allele frequency over one generation).<p>
*Migration* (or gene flow): Some beetles with brown genes immigrated from<br>
another population, or some beetles carrying green genes emigrated.<p>
*Genetic drift*: When the beetles reproduced, just by random luck more brown<br>
genes than green genes ended up in the offspring. In the diagram at right,<br>
brown genes occur slightly more frequently in the offspring (29%) than in<br>
the parent generation (25%).<p>
*Natural selection*: Beetles with brown genes escaped predation and survived<br>
to reproduce more frequently than beetles with green genes, so that more<br>
brown genes got into the next generation.<br>
<h3>Speciation</h3>
What are species anyway, and how do new ones evolve?<p>
Here, you can explore different ways to define a species and learn about the<br>
various processes through which speciation can occur. This section also<br>
addresses the topics of cospeciation—when two lineages split in concert with<br>
one another—and modes of speciation that are specific to plants.<p>
Let's start by defining a species.<br>
<h3>Defining a Species</h3>
A species is often defined as a group of individuals that actually or<br>
potentially interbreed in nature. In this sense, a species is the biggest<br>
gene pool possible under natural conditions.<p>
That definition of a species might seem cut and dried, but it is not—in<br>
nature, there are lots of places where it is difficult to apply this<br>
definition. For example, many bacteria reproduce mainly asexually. An<br>
example of this would be by binary fission. The definition of a species as a<br>
group of interbreeding individuals cannot be easily applied to organisms<br>
that reproduce only or mainly asexually.<p>
Also, many plants, and some animals, form hybrids in nature. Hooded crows<br>
and carrion crows look different, and largely mate within their own<br>
groups—but in some areas, they hybridize. Should they be considered the same<br>
species or separate species?<p>
If two lineages of oak look quite different, but occasionally form hybrids<br>
with each other, should we count them as different species? There are lots<br>
of other places where the boundary of a species is blurred. It's not so<br>
surprising that these blurry places exist—after all, the idea of a species<br>
is something that we humans invented for our own convenience!<br>
<h3>Defining Speciation</h3>
Speciation is a lineage-splitting event that produces two or more separate<br>
species. Imagine that you are looking at a tip of the tree of life that<br>
constitutes a species of fruit fly. Move down the phylogeny to where your<br>
fruit fly twig is connected to the rest of the tree. That branching point,<br>
and every other branching point on the tree, is a speciation event. At that<br>
point genetic changes resulted in two separate fruit fly lineages, where<br>
previously there had just been one lineage. But why and how did it happen?<p>
The branching points on this partial Drosophila phylogeny represent long<br>
past speciation events. Here is one scenario that exemplifies how speciation<br>
can happen:<p>
*The scene*: a population of wild fruit flies minding its own business on<br>
several bunches of rotting bananas, cheerfully laying their eggs in the<br>
mushy fruit...<p>
*Disaster strikes*: A hurricane washes the bananas and the immature fruit<br>
flies they contain out to sea. The banana bunch eventually washes up on an<br>
island off the coast of the mainland. The fruit flies mature and emerge from<br>
their slimy nursery onto the lonely island. The two portions of the<br>
population, mainland and island, are now too far apart for gene flow to<br>
unite them. At this point, speciation has not occurred—any fruit flies that<br>
got back to the mainland could mate and produce healthy offspring with the<br>
mainland flies.<p>
*The populations diverge*: Ecological conditions are slightly different on<br>
the island, and the island population evolves under different selective<br>
pressures and experiences different random events than the mainland<br>
population does. Morphology, food preferences, and courtship displays change<br>
over the course of many generations of natural selection.<p>
*So we meet again*: When another storm reintroduces the island flies to the<br>
mainland, they will not readily mate with the mainland flies since they've<br>
evolved different courtship behaviors. The few that do mate with the<br>
mainland flies, produce inviable eggs because of other genetic differences<br>
between the two populations. The lineage has split now that genes cannot<br>
flow between the populations.<p>
This is a simplified model of speciation by geographic isolation, but it<br>
gives an idea of some of the processes that might be at work in speciation.<br>
In most real-life cases, we can only put together part of the story from the<br>
available evidence. However, the evidence that this sort of process does<br>
happen is strong.<br>
<h3>Causes of Speciation</h3>
1. *Geographic Isolation*<br>
In the fruit fly example, some fruit fly larvae were washed up on an<br>
island, and speciation started because populations were prevented from<br>
interbreeding by geographic isolation. Scientists think that geographic<br>
isolation is a common way for the process of speciation to begin: rivers<br>
change course, mountains rise, continents drift, organisms migrate, and what<br>
was once a continuous population is divided into two or more smaller<br>
populations.<p>
It doesn't even need to be a physical barrier like a river that<br>
separates two or more groups of organisms—it might just be unfavorable<br>
habitat between the two populations that keeps them from mating with one<br>
another.<br>
2. *Reduction of Gene Flow<br>
*However, speciation might also happen in a population with no<br>
specific extrinsic barrier to gene flow. Imagine a situation in which a<br>
population extends over a broad geographic range, and mating throughout the<br>
population is not random. Individuals in the far west would have zero chance<br>
of mating with individuals in the far eastern end of the range. So we have<br>
reduced gene flow, but not total isolation. This may or may not be<br>
sufficient to cause speciation. Speciation would probably also require<br>
different selective pressures at opposite ends of the range, which would<br>
alter gene frequencies in groups at different ends of the range so much that<br>
they would not be able to mate if they were reunited.<p>
Even in the absence of a geographic barrier, reduced gene flow across<br>
a species' range can encourage speciation.<br>
<h2>Macroevolution</h2>
*Macroevolution* is evolution on a grand scale—what we see when we look at<br>
the over-arching history of life: stability, change, lineages arising, and<br>
extinction.<p>
Here, you can examine the patterns of macroevolution in evolutionary history<br>
and find out how scientists investigate deep history.<br>
<h3>Definition: What is Macroevolution?</h3>
Macroevolution generally refers to evolution above the species level. So<br>
instead of focusing on an individual beetle species, a macroevolutionary<br>
lens might require that we zoom out on the tree of life, to assess the<br>
diversity of the entire beetle clade and its position on the tree.<p>
Macroevolution encompasses the grandest trends and transformations in<br>
evolution, such as the origin of mammals and the radiation of flowering<br>
plants. Macroevolutionary patterns are generally what we see when we look at<br>
the large-scale history of life.<p>
It is not necessarily easy to "see" macroevolutionary history; there are no<br>
firsthand accounts to be read. Instead, we reconstruct the history of life<br>
using all available evidence: geology, fossils, and living organisms.<p>
Once we've figured out what evolutionary events have taken place, we try to<br>
figure out how they happened. Just as in microevolution, basic evolutionary<br>
mechanisms like mutation, migration, genetic drift, and natural selection<br>
are at work and can help explain many large-scale patterns in the history of<br>
life.<p>
The basic evolutionary mechanisms—mutation, migration, genetic drift, and<br>
natural selection—can produce major evolutionary change if given enough<br>
time.<p>
A process like mutation might seem too small-scale to influence a pattern as<br>
amazing as the beetle radiation, or as large as the difference between dogs<br>
and pine trees, but it's not. Life on Earth has been accumulating mutations<br>
and passing them through the filter of natural selection for 3.8 billion<br>
years—more than enough time for evolutionary processes to produce its grand<br>
history.<br>
<h3>Patterns in Macroevolution</h3>
You can think of patterns as "what happened when." All of the changes,<br>
diversifications, and extinctions that happened over the course of life's<br>
history are the patterns of macroevolution.<p>
However, beyond the details of individual past events—such as, when the<br>
beetle radiation began or what the first flowers looked like—biologists are<br>
interested in general patterns that recur across the tree of life:<p>
1. *Stasis*: Many lineages on the tree of life exhibit stasis, which<br>
just means that they don't change much for a long time, as shown in the<br>
figure to the right.<br>
In fact, some lineages have changed so little for such a long time<br>
that they are often called living fossils. Coelacanths comprise a fish<br>
lineage that branched off of the tree near the base of the vertebrate clade.<br>
Until 1938, scientists thought that coelacanths went extinct 80 million<br>
years ago. But in 1938, scientists discovered a living coelacanth from a<br>
population in the Indian Ocean that looked very similar to its fossil<br>
ancestors. Hence, the coelacanth lineage exhibits about 80 million years'<br>
worth of morphological stasis.<br>
2. *Character change*: Lineages can change quickly or slowly.<br>
Character change can happen in a single direction, such as evolving<br>
additional segments, or it can reverse itself by gaining and then losing<br>
segments. Changes can occur within a single lineage or across several<br>
lineages. In the figure to the right, lineage A changes rapidly but in no<br>
particular direction. Lineage B shows slower, directional change.<p>
Trilobites, animals in the same clade as modern insects and<br>
crustaceans, lived over 300 million years ago. As shown below, their fossil<br>
record clearly suggests that several lineages underwent similar increases in<br>
segment number over the course of millions of years.<br>
3. *Lineage-splitting (or speciation)*: Patterns of lineage-splitting<br>
can be identified by constructing and examining a phylogeny. The phylogeny<br>
might reveal that a particular lineage has undergone unusually frequent<br>
lineage-splitting, generating a "bushy" tuft of branches on the tree. It<br>
might reveal that a lineage has an unusually low rate of lineage-splitting,<br>
represented by a long branch with very few twigs coming off. Or it might<br>
reveal that several lineages experienced a burst of lineage-splitting at the<br>
same time.<br>
4. *Extinction*: Extinction is extremely important in the history of<br>
life. It can be a frequent or rare event within a lineage, or it can occur<br>
simultaneously across many lineages (mass extinction). Every lineage has<br>
some chance of becoming extinct, and overwhelmingly, species have ended up<br>
in the losing slots on this roulette wheel: over 99% of the species that<br>
have ever lived on Earth have gone extinct.<br>
<h2>The Big Issues</h2>
All available evidence supports the central conclusions of evolutionary<br>
theory, that life on Earth has evolved and that species share common<br>
ancestors. Biologists are not arguing about these conclusions. But they are<br>
trying to figure out how evolution happens—and that's not an easy job. It<br>
involves collecting data, proposing hypotheses, creating models, and<br>
evaluating other scientists' work. These are all activities that we can, and<br>
should, hold up to our checklist and ask the question: are they doing<br>
science?<p>
All sciences ask questions about the natural world, propose explanations in<br>
terms of natural processes, and evaluate these explanations using evidence<br>
from the natural world. Evolutionary biology is no exception. Darwin's basic<br>
conception of evolutionary change and diversification explains many<br>
observations in terms of natural processes and is supported by evidence from<br>
the natural world.<p>
Some of the questions that evolutionary biologists are trying to answer<br>
include:<p>
1. Does evolution tend to proceed slowly and steadily or in quick<br>
jumps?<br>
2. Why are some clades very diverse and some unusually sparse?<br>
3. How does evolution produce new and complex features?<br>
4. Are there trends in evolution, and if so, what processes generate<br>
them?<br>
<h3>The Pace of Evolution</h3>
Does evolution occur in rapid bursts or gradually? This question is<br>
difficult to answer because we can't replay the past with a stopwatch in<br>
hand. However, we can try to figure out what patterns we'd expect to observe<br>
in the fossil record if evolution did happen in bursts, or if evolution<br>
happened gradually. Then we can check these predictions against what we<br>
observe.<p>
- *What should we observe in the fossil record if evolution is slow<br>
and steady?*<br>
If evolution is slow and steady, we'd expect to see the entire<br>
transition, from ancestor to descendent, displayed as transitional forms<br>
over a long period of time in the fossil record.<br>
- *What would we observe in the fossil record if evolution happens in<br>
"quick" jumps (perhaps fewer than 100,000 years for significant change)?<br>
* If evolution happens in "quick" jumps, we'd expect to see big<br>
changes happen quickly in the fossil record, with little transition between<br>
ancestor and descendent.<p>
When evolution is rapid, transitional forms may not be preserved, even<br>
if fossils are laid down at regular intervals. We see many examples of this<br>
"quick" jumps pattern in the fossil record.<br>
- *Does a jump in the fossil record necessarily mean that evolution<br>
has happened in a "quick" jump?* We expect to see a jump in the<br>
fossil record if evolution has occurred as a "quick" jump, but a jump in the<br>
fossil record can also be explained by irregular fossil preservation.<p>
This possibility can make it difficult to conclude that evolution has<br>
happened rapidly.<p>
We observe examples of both slow, steady change and rapid, periodic change<br>
in the fossil record. Both happen. But scientists are trying to determine<br>
which pace is more typical of evolution and how each sort of evolutionary<br>
change happens.<br>
<h3>Diversity in Clades</h3>
Imagine that you've traveled back in time to around 350 million years ago,<br>
give or take 50 million years. Your goal is to check out the cool insects<br>
living at this point in time. You see a lot of little insects that look like<br>
modern silverfish—no big deal.<p>
But something interesting and significant is happening that you can't see—a<br>
lineage has split into two. One of these newly isolated lineages will<br>
eventually give rise to about 400 extant species that look a lot like the<br>
ancient insects you see. But the other lineage will give rise to millions of<br>
extant insect species, the bulk of animal life on Earth today. Why is there<br>
such a big difference in diversity between these two lineages? After all,<br>
they were indistinguishable 350 million years ago...<p>
Why would one lineage lead to millions of species and the other to only 400?<p>
<br>
1. *Opportunity knocks*: One possibility is that the now-diverse lineage<br>
happened to be in the right place at the right time. The environment<br>
presented opportunities, and the lineage was able to take advantage of them.<br>
What sorts of factors in the environment might encourage diversification?<p>
<br>
- The environment may have offered opportunities for specialization.<br>
- A fragmented environment might make reproductive isolation<br>
likely.<br>
- The environment may have provided a release from competition<br>
with other insects.<p>
All of these factors might be at work in some situations. Consider a<br>
plant-eating insect that colonizes a tropical island. On its mainland home,<br>
the insect's population size and range of resources is constrained by other<br>
species competing for the same resources. But the lack of similar species on<br>
the island means open niches and reduced competition from other species.<br>
Further, the island offers new kinds of food in the form of plants that the<br>
insect has never seen before. Selection might allow some insects to<br>
specialize on these new plants. Hanging around each kind of plant might mean<br>
that the insects get to mate with insects on a different plant less<br>
frequently, encouraging reproductive isolation. All of these factors can<br>
drive diversification—but only if the population has the genetic variation<br>
to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the environment. Being<br>
in the right place at the right time is a reason that one clade might be<br>
more diverse than another.<p>
2. *Adaptive Radiation*: If all of this diversification happens in a short<br>
amount of time, it is often referred to as an adaptive radiation. Although<br>
biologists have different standards for defining an adaptive radiation, it<br>
generally means an event in which a lineage rapidly diversifies, with the<br>
newly formed lineages evolving different adaptations. The rapid<br>
diversification of mammals shown below may constitute an adaptive radiation.<p>
<br>
3. *Historical changes in diversity*: Many events have left their marks on<br>
the diversity of life on Earth, pruning or growing the tree of lifeóbut a<br>
few stand out as unusually important:<p>
a. Explosion: About 530 million years ago, a huge variety of marine animals<br>
suddenly burst onto the evolutionary scene. (Of course, "suddenly," in<br>
geological terms, means in perhaps 10 million years). These animals had a<br>
variety of new body forms that evolution has been using to produce<br>
"spin-offs" ever since, such as these representatives from the Burgess<br>
Shale.<p>
b. Extinction: About 225 million years ago, over 90% of the species alive at<br>
the time went extinct in fewer than 10 million years. Some groups that were<br>
dominant before the extinction never recovered. The cause of this extinction<br>
is the subject of much debate, but of equal significance is that it set the<br>
stage for a massive diversification of taxa that filled the empty niches.<br>
<h3>Looking at Complexity</h3>
Complex adaptions: bird wings, insect wings, insect eyes, and vertebrate<br>
eyes. Life is full of grand complications, such as aerodynamic wings,<br>
multi-part organs like eyes, and intricate chemical pathways. When faced<br>
with such complexity, both opponents and proponents of evolution, Darwin<br>
included, have asked the question: how could it evolve? Science does not<br>
sweep such difficult questions under the rug, but takes them up as<br>
interesting areas for research. The difficulty is as follows.<p>
Since many of these complex traits seem to be adaptive, they are likely to<br>
have evolved in small steps through natural selection. That is, intermediate<br>
forms of the adaptation must have evolved before evolution arrived at a<br>
fully-fledged wing, chemical pathway, or eye. But what good is half a wing<br>
or only a few of the elements of an eyeball? The intermediate forms of these<br>
adaptations may not seem adaptive—so how could they be produced by natural<br>
selection?<p>
There are several ways such complex novelties may evolve:<p>
- *Advantageous intermediates*: It's possible that those intermediate<br>
stages actually were advantageous, even if not in an obvious way. What good<br>
is "half an eye?" A simple eye with just a few of the components of a<br>
complex eye could still sense light and dark, like eyespots on simple<br>
flatworms do. This ability might have been advantageous for an organism with<br>
no vision at all and could have evolved through natural selection.<br>
- *Co-opting*: The intermediate stages of a complex feature might have<br>
served a different purpose than the fully-fledged adaptation serves. What<br>
good is "half a wing?" Even if it's not good for flying, it might be good<br>
for something else. The evolution of the very first feathers might have had<br>
nothing to do with flight and everything to do with insulation or display.<br>
Natural selection is an excellent thief, taking features that evolved in one<br>
context and using them for new functions.<br>
<h3>Trends in Evolution</h3>
<br>
1. *What is a trend?<br>
*An evolutionary trend can be either directional change within a<br>
single lineage or parallel change across lineages, in other words, several<br>
lineages undergoing the same sort of change. However, not just any change<br>
counts as a trend. After all, if the weather gets warmer one day, you<br>
wouldn't call it a warming trend; warming would have to go on for some<br>
length of time before you'd call it a trend. Biologists think about<br>
evolutionary trends in the same way—there has to be something about the<br>
change that suggests that it's not just a random fluctuation before it<br>
counts as a "trend."<p>
For example, titanotheres (a cool, extinct clade related to modern<br>
horses and rhinos) exhibit an evolutionary trend. Titanotheres had bony<br>
protuberances extending from their noses. The sequence of fossil skulls from<br>
these animals shows that evolutionary changes in the size of these "horns"<br>
were not random; instead, changes were biased in the direction of increasing<br>
horn size. And in fact, several different titanothere lineages experienced<br>
the same sort of change in horn size.<p>
The titanothere reconstructions range from about 55 mya to 35 mya.<br>
The cause of this trend is not obvious. It may be a by-product of selection for<br>
increasing body size, and/or it may be a result of selection on horn size<br>
directly: big-horned individuals may have had an advantage in "butting"<br>
contests for females, as in sheep and goats.<p>
Other evolutionary trends are not so consistent across lineages. For<br>
example, many different animal lineages have undergone cephalization,<br>
basically "the evolution of a head." Cephalization involves concentrating<br>
neurons into a brain at one end of the animal and evolving sensory organs at<br>
that same end. Arthropods (crustaceans, insects, and family), annelids<br>
(segmented worms), and chordates have all undergone increasing<br>
cephalization. However, many animal lineages have not undergone much<br>
cephalization (where's the head on a starfish?), and other lineages, such as<br>
many internal parasites, have gone in the reverse direction, losing the<br>
"heads" they started out with.<br>
2. *Is evolution progressive?*<br>
This is not an easy question to answer. From a plant's perspective,<br>
the best measure of progress might be photosynthetic ability; from a<br>
spider's it might be the efficiency of a venom delivery system.<p>
The problem is that we humans are hung up on ourselves. We often<br>
define progress in a way that hinges on our view of ourselves, a way that<br>
relies on intellect, culture, or emotion. But that definition is<br>
anthropocentric.<p>
It is tempting to see evolution as a grand progressive ladder with<br>
Homo sapiens emerging at the top. But evolution produces a tree, not a<br>
ladder—and we are just one of many leaves on the tree.</p>
