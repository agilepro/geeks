Jesus was a man who lived and preached in Palestine during the early first
century, who gave rise to a faith movement centered upon himself which would go
on to become one of the world’s great religions, might seem to be a fairly
straightforward proposition. The idea lies at the base of nearly 2000 years of
Christian belief and remains the starting point for almost all scholarly study
of Christian origins. And yet, accommodating such a simple assumption to the
documentary evidence is an exceedingly difficult task, a puzzle whose solution
has proven stubbornly, perplexingly, maddeningly elusive.</font></font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">If we could reduce the complexity of
the evidence to a number of identifiable elements, including the wider setting
of the times in which Christianity arose, we might come up with a list of ten
puzzle pieces:</font>
<p><b><i><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman">Piece No. 1: A Conspiracy of
Silence</font></i></b>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">In the first half century of Christian
correspondence, including letters attributed to Paul and other epistles under
names like Peter, James and John, the Gospel story cannot be found. When these
writers speak of their divine Christ, echoes of Jesus of Nazareth are virtually
inaudible, including details of a life and ministry, the circumstances of his
death, the attribution of any teachings to him. God himself is often identified
as the source of Christian ethics. No one speaks of miracles performed by Jesus,
his apocalyptic predictions, his views on any of the great issues of the time.
The very fact that he preached in person is never mentioned, his appointment of
apostles or his directive to carry the message to the nations of the world is
never appealed to. No one looks back to Jesus’ life and ministry as the genesis
of the Christian movement, or as the pivot point of salvation history. The great
characters of the Jesus story, Mary his mother, Joseph his father, John his
herald, Judas his betrayer, Pilate his executioner: none of them receive a
mention in all the Christian correspondence of the first century. As for holy
places, there are none to be found, for not a single epistle writer breathes a
word about any of the sites of Jesus’ career, not even Calvary where he died for
the world’s sins, or the empty tomb where he rose from the dead to guarantee a
universal resurrection.</font>
<br><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="+1">The one clear placement of
Christ in recent times, the accusation in 1 Thessalonians 2:15-16 that Jews in
Judea had killed the Lord Jesus, has been rejected as an interpolation by most
of today’s liberal scholars,<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#1">1</a></sup>
while the one Gospel episode Paul seems to allude to, Jesus’ words over the
bread and wine at what he calls "the Lord’s Supper" in 1 Corinthians 11:23f, can
be interpreted as a mythical scene Paul has himself developed through perceived
revelation (see Piece No. 5). Otherwise, no non-Gospel writer of the first
century makes any statement which would link the divine spiritual Son and Christ
they all worship and look to for salvation, with a man who had recently walked
the sands of Palestine, taught and prophecied and performed miracles, a man
executed by Pontius Pilate on Good Friday outside Jerusalem, to rise from a
nearby tomb on Easter Sunday morning. This "conspiracy of silence" is as
pervasive as it is astonishing.</font>[See
<a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/partone.htm">Part One: A Conspiracy of
Silence</a> in the Main Articles.]</font>
<br><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="+1">The Gospel Jesus and his story
is equally missing from the non-Christian record of the time. Philo of
Alexandria, the Jewish historian Justus of Tiberias, Pliny the Elder as
collector of reputed natural phenomena, early Roman satirists and philosophers:
all are silent. Pliny the Younger, in his letter to Trajan from Bithynia c.112,
does not speak of Christ in historical terms. Josephus’ famous passage in <i>
Antiquities</i> 18 is acknowledged to be, as it stands, a Christian
interpolation, and arguments that an original reference to Jesus either stood
there or can be distilled from the present one, founder on the universal silence
about such a reference on the part of Christian commentators until the 4th
century.<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#2">2</a></sup>
As for the reference in <i>Antiquities</i> 20 to James as "brother of Jesus, the
one called (the) Christ", this passage also bears the marks of Christian
interference.<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#3">3</a></sup>
The phrase originally used by Josephus may have been the same designation which
Paul gives to James (Galatians 1:19), namely "brother of the Lord," which would
have referred not to a sibling relationship with Jesus, but to James’ position
in the Jerusalem brotherhood, something which was probably widely known. A
Christian copyist could later have altered the phrase (under the influence of
Matthew 1:16) to render it more "historical" after Jesus of Nazareth was
developed.</font>[For a complete examination (and partial rethinking) of the
Josephus question, see Supplementary Article No 10:

Reopening the Josephus Question</a>.]</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">The Roman historian Tacitus (<i>Annals</i>
15:44), is the first pagan writer to speak of Jesus as a man crucified by
Pilate. Rather than representing information he dug out of an archive (the
Romans would hardly have kept a record of the countless crucifixions around the
empire going back a century), this was probably derived from Christian hearsay
about a human founder of the movement, newly circulating in the Rome of Tacitus’
day (c.115). On the other hand, there are those who question the authenticity of
this passage as well. Around the same time, Suetonius’ report (<i>Claudius,</i>
25) about Jews in Rome agitating under "Chrestus" in the reign of Claudius is so
brief and uncertain, it may not be about Christ and Christians at all. In any
case, it would not witness to an historical Jesus.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">As for the references to Jesus in the
Jewish Talmud: even though some remarks are attributed to rabbis who flourished
around the end of the first century (none earlier), they were not written down
before the third century, and thus are unreliable. In any case, they are so
cryptic and off the mark, they can scarcely be identified with the Gospel
figure.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">[For the non-Christian witness to Jesus, see

Main Articles.]</font>
<p><b><i><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman">Piece No. 2: A Transcendent
Christ and a Missing Equation</font></i></b>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">When early writers like Paul speak of
their "Christ Jesus", they do so in exclusively mythological terms. He is the
divine Son in heaven, speaking through scripture, connected to the believer in
mystical ways. Christ Jesus is the very substance of Godhead, pre-existent and
the image of the Father. Through him God effected creation, and his sustaining
power holds the universe together. Christ is also the cosmic redeemer who
descended from heaven to undergo a sacrificial death (an earthly time and place
is never stated) and was subsequently exalted and enthroned by God’s side.
Through this saving drama, Christ has subjugated the demon spirits of the air
who harass humanity, he has brought the souls of the dead righteous out of
Shoel, he has been given kingship over all supernatural and earthly powers, and
he has reconciled an estranged universe to God. He has also been given divine
titles formerly reserved for God.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Heady stuff. And all within two
decades or less of the presumed man’s life, a life which has apparently
disappeared from the minds of those early believers in the cosmic Son, since
they provide no mention of it, nor make any connection between the two. For all
that Paul and others have to say about faith, no one ever raises the need to
have faith that Jesus of Nazareth was the Son of God and Messiah. The very
equation: "The divine, spiritual Son = Jesus of Nazareth, recently on earth," is
universally missing.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Even the death of Christ is presented
in mythical terms. Passages like 1 Thessalonians 4:13 ("We believe Jesus died
and rose again"), and the apparent designation of scripture as the source of
Paul’s doctrine that Christ died for our sins (1 Corinthians 15:3), suggest that
Christ’s death was an article of faith, not a remembered historical event. The
same is true, of course, for the resurrection. Paul never places Jesus’ death in
an historical setting (he never even tells us that Christ was <i>tried</i>), and
in 1 Corinthians 2:8 he assigns responsibility for the crucifixion to the
"rulers of this age" who unwittingly crucified "the Lord of glory" and thereby
ensured their own destined destruction.</font>
<br><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="+1">While the meaning of the phrase
"rulers of this age" has been much debated, weight of opinion<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#4">4</a></sup>
has come down on the side of the demon powers who were thought to inhabit the
lower celestial spheres and were responsible for the evils of the world and its
separation from God. This interpretation is supported by references to the
demonic powers in relation to Christ’s work in Colossians 2:15 and Ephesians
3:10; and by chapter 9 of the Ascension of Isaiah, which describes the descent
of the Son through the heavenly spheres and declares that he shall be hung upon
a tree "by the god of that world," meaning Satan and his angels of the
firmament. They, too, do not know who he is (9:13,15).</font>[See Supplementary
Article No. 3: <a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/supp03.htm">Who
Crucified Jesus?</a>]</font>
<br><p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">2 Timothy 1:9 is another passage which
alludes to an upper-world, beyond-time setting for the redeeming act: "God’s
grace was given to us in Christ Jesus <i>pro chronon aionion—</i>before the
beginning of time..." Knowledge of it has only now been brought to light by the
revelation of the savior Jesus Christ (verse 10). The meaning of that Greek
phrase is another much-debated item,<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#5">5</a></sup>
but it would seem to be an attempt to convey that Christ’s redeeming act took
place outside the normal boundaries of time and space, in an upper Platonic
realm of God.</font>

<p><b><i><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman">Piece No. 3: A Time of
Revelation</font></i></b>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">How do Paul and other apostles like
himself know of their Son and Redeemer? Is it through the words and deeds of
Jesus on earth? Through traditions about him going back to those who had
witnessed his ministry? No, Paul has learned of the Son through revelation and
scripture. "God chose to reveal his Son through me," he says in Galatians 1:16.
The writer of Ephesians, in 3:4-5, gives us the main elements of the new
revelatory drama: "The mystery about Christ, which in former generations was not
revealed to men, is now disclosed to dedicated apostles and prophets through the
Spirit." Paul points to scripture (Romans 1:2, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4) as the
source of his gospel, his knowledge about Christ and his saving work. It is God,
through the Spirit, who has supplied this gospel, God who has appointed apostles
like Paul to carry the message. All of it is couched in revelatory language,
with words like <i>phaneroo</i>, <i>apokalupto</i>, <i>epiphaneia</i>.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">The existence and role of the divine
Son has hitherto been unknown. He has been a secret, a "mystery" hidden for long
ages with God in heaven, now revealed together with the benefits of his saving
act. This is what Paul and the other epistle writers are constantly telling us:
in Romans 3:21f, 16:25-27, Colossians 1:26 and 2:2, 1 Peter 1:20. They trace
nothing back to a human Jesus and indeed, as in Titus 1:2-3, often leave no room
for such a figure in their picture of the beginnings of the Christian movement.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Instead, they speak of Christ as <i>
now</i> present on earth (e.g., 1 John 5:20), sent by God as he has also sent
the Spirit. (The Spirit and the Son are sometimes linked, as in Romans 8:9,
Galatians 4:6, Phil. 1:19.) As the Pauline letters convey through the use of
their ubiquitous phrase "in—or through—Christ" (e.g., Romans 6:11, Ephesians
1:4, Titus 3:6), Christ is a spiritual medium through which God is revealing
himself and doing his work in the world. He is a mystical force, part of and
interacting with his believers, and he is God’s agent of salvation. All this
lies plainly on the pages of the New Testament epistles, while beside it stands
a void on the Gospel Jesus.</font>

Gospel</a>.]</font>
<p><b><i><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman">Piece No. 4: The Mythological
Picture of the Times</font></i></b>
<br><p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">When we examine the mythological
features supposedly conferred upon an historical Jesus so soon after his
passing, we find that they all have their roots in contemporary religious
philosophy. The developing concept that an increasingly transcendent God
required an intermediary in order to have contact with the base world of matter
had led to the invention of secondary divine forces in both Greek and Jewish
thinking. For the Greeks, as well as philosophers of Hellenistic Judaism like
Philo, the Logos (largely an abstract concept) became the Platonic intermediary
who was the image of God, the force which had produced creation, and a continual
channel of spiritual communion between Deity and humanity.<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#6">6</a></sup>
All these properties are present in the early Christian view of the spiritual
Christ.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">In Jewish thinking, the figure of
personified Wisdom was envisioned as an emanation of God, his communicating
aspect and one who brought knowledge of him and his will to humanity. She
developed her own myths about coming to the world and inviting men and women to
learn from her (as in Proverbs, Baruch, the Wisdom of Solomon). She eventually
became very Logos-like, described as God’s agent of creation and the divine
power that pervades and sustains all things (Wisdom of Solomon 7:22-30). She was
God’s throne-partner and his very image.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">These features, too, are part of the
language about Christ used by Paul and his contemporaries. Christ sits at the
right hand of God, it was through him that "all things came to be and we through
him," (1 Corinthians 8:6); he too sustains the universe by his word of power
(Hebrews 1:3, Colossians 1:15f). Like the Logos and Sophia (Wisdom), only the
Son "knows" the Father, and humanity can only know God through the Son.</font>

<p><b><i><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman">Piece No. 5: Savior Deities in a
Layered Universe</font></i></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="+1">The most popular expression of
religious faith during the era which saw the rise of Christianity was not the
official state religion of "Olympian" gods, but the salvation cults known as the
"mystery religions". Each of these had its savior god or goddess, such as
Mithra, Dionysos, Attis, Isis, Osiris. Most of these cults possessed myths in
which the savior deity had overcome death in some way (not necessarily raised
from it), or performed some act whose effects guaranteed for the initiates good
fortune in this world and a happy existence in the next. Their rituals included
communal sacred meals, often involving such things as bread and wine and bearing
strong resemblance to Christian sacramentalism (Paul’s Lord’s Supper myth may
well have been influenced by Mithraic counterparts), and the mystical
relationships between initiate and deity are very similar to those expounded by
Paul in his branch of Christian belief. While Christianity and the pagan cults
interacted on one another as time went on, both can be regarded as more or less
independent branches of the same broad, ancient-world tree.</font>[For the
mysteries, see <a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/parttwo.htm">Part Two:
Who Was Christ Jesus?</a> and Supplementary Article No. 6:
<a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/supp06.htm">The Source of Paul's
Gospel: </a><i>Learning of a Sacred Meal</i>, and
<a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/rfset4.htm#Miles">Response to Miles</a>.]</font>
<br><p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">In the period around the turn of the
era, Platonism divided the universe into a timeless, perfect higher realm
(containing the "genuine" reality, accessible to the intellect), and an
imperfect, transient world of matter as its copy. The mythical activity of the
cultic gods was thought to take place in this upper dimension of reality, having
effects on humanity below. (Such Platonic-style thinking tended to supplant
older views of myth which regarded this activity of gods as having occurred in a
primordial, sacred past.) This was combined with other, more popular views which
saw the universe as multi-layered, from the world of base matter where humans
lived, to the highest level of pure spirit where the ultimate God dwelled. The
layers between (usually seven, plus the air or "firmament" between earth and
moon) were populated by various sorts of angels, spirits and demons. The latter,
responsible for the evils that afflicted mankind and in the Jewish mind
associated with Satan, filled the lowest spirit layer and were regarded as part
of the realm of "flesh",<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#7">7</a></sup>
cutting off earth from heaven.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="+1">To perform their salvific work,
the savior gods descended into the lower reaches of the spiritual world, taking
on increasing resemblance to lower and material forms: Attis, for example (so
Julian the "Apostate" relates in <i>Orations V</i>), to the level just above the
moon; Christ, so Paul indicates in 1 Corinthians 2:8, along with the writer of
the Ascension of Isaiah 9, to the sphere of Satan and his powers in the
firmament. Here Christ, having assumed the "likeness" of flesh and a man
(Ascension 9:13 and Philippians 2:7-8), was crucified. As passages like
Ephesians 6:12 indicate, a cosmic battle was going on for control of the world,
between the forces of darkness headed by Satan, and the forces of good directed
by God. Christ was God’s agent, his Messiah, in this struggle. The crucifixion
was regarded as a decisive move in the cosmic battle with the demons, wherein
Christ subjected these spirits to himself and restored the unity of the universe
(Ephesians 1:10).</font>[See Supplementary Article No. 3:
<a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/supp03.htm">Who Crucified Jesus?</a>]</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">More sophisticated philosophers like
Plutarch and Sallustius regarded the stories of the Greek salvation cults as
allegorical interpretations only, "eternal meanings clothed in myth."
Sallustius, writing in the 4th century, speaks of the story of Attis as "an
eternal cosmic process, not an isolated event of the past" (<i>On Gods and the
World</i>, 9). Paul, while he shows no sign of regarding the myth and suffering
of Jesus in anything but literal terms, would have been quite capable of placing
such redeeming activity in this upper, spiritual realm, and indeed his language
shows every sign of such an interpretation.</font>

section I.]</font>
<p><b><i><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman">Piece No. 6: A Single Story of
Jesus</font></i></b>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">The story of Jesus of Nazareth is, for
the first hundred years of Christianity, to be found only in the Gospels.
Moreover, each of the Gospels is dependent for that story on the first one
written, "Mark". That Matthew and Luke are reworkings of Mark with extra, mostly
teaching, material added, is now almost universally accepted. Opinion is split
as to whether the narrative elements of John are derived from some Synoptic
source as well. But since the Fourth Gospel, despite some considerable revamping
to fit John’s own theology, gives us no fundamentally different material in its
narrative of Jesus’ life from that of the Synoptics, it is likely that it too
goes back ultimately to the first Gospel for its picture of the "historical
Jesus." (The so-called Discourses and distinctive Johannine Christology may well
be the earliest layer of tradition, originally applied to a spiritual Revealer
Son, upon which the "historical" Synoptic-derived biography has been overlaid.)
We thus have a Christian movement spanning half the empire and a full century of
existence which nevertheless has managed to produce only one version of the
events that are supposed to lie at its inception.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Modern scholars often refer to the
common teaching and anecdotal material extracted from Matthew and Luke, now
known by the designation "Q", as a "Gospel", though it is not a narrative work,
nor organized according to any other fashion than the traditional sayings
collection. But their confident claim that the material of this lost document,
or at least the earliest stratum of it, can be traced back to an historical
Jesus and thus constitutes an independent witness to him is not warranted, as I
will try to demonstrate in Part Three [of this article].</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Acts, too, as an historical witness to
Jesus or the beginnings of the Christian movement, cannot be relied upon. The
more recent tendency is to see Acts as a second century product, probably of
Roman provenance, highly tendentious and written for the purpose of creating a
picture of Christian origins traceable to a unified body of apostles in
Jerusalem who were followers of an historical Jesus. Much of it is sheer
fabrication, and highly incompatible with information found in the letters of
Paul. There is no attestion for Acts prior to the 170s.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">[See
<a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/partthre.htm">Part Three: The
Evolution of Jesus of Nazareth</a>.]</font>
<p><b><i><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman">Piece No. 7: The Gospels in
Limbo</font></i></b>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">The dating of the Gospels is partly to
be determined by their attestion in the wider Christian writings. Here we run
into an astonishing state of affairs, for there is no clear sign of them before
the middle of the second century. No surviving writer before Justin makes use of
narrative documents containing words and deeds of Jesus of Nazareth, and more
often than not Justin’s quotations do not fit our canonical texts, indicating
that such works were still in the process of development, not to be finalized
until some time later.</font>
<br><p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Earlier allusions to teachings or
anecdotes resembling those of the Gospels seem not to be from written works, but
probably reflect developing traditions which themselves found their way into the
written Gospels.<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#8">8</a></sup>
And Papias’ reference (around 120-130?, as reported by Eusebius) to documents
attributed to "Matthew" and "Mark" cannot be reconciled with the narrative
Gospels which now go by those names, names which were still unknown to Justin as
belonging to his "memoirs of the Apostles". Moreover, these were documents which
Papias himself had not seen,<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#9">9</a></sup>
but had learned about from another, making the whole report a distant third
hand.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Thus, when scholars regularly date the
Gospels between 65 and 100, they present us with a scenario in which the story
of Jesus’ life as told by the evangelists remains in a limbo and fails to
register on the wider Christian consciousness for almost a hundred years after
it was first committed to paper. A generally later dating would seem to be
required, perhaps with Mark in its initial version coming no earlier than the
year 90. (The standard dating based on Mark 13 is not necessarily valid, since
apocalyptic expectations continued until at least the end of the century, and
Jesus’ suggestion in 13:7 is that some time must pass after the Jewish War
before the End-time arrives.)</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">[See

Evolution of Jesus of Nazareth</a>.]</font>
<p><b><i><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman">Piece No. 8: The Gospels Not
History</font></i></b>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">When the content of the Gospels is
examined, two fundamental characteristics emerge to cast serious doubt on the
historicity of their story of Jesus.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">One is their incompatible nature. The
irreconcilability of such things as the baptism and nativity stories, the
finding of the empty tomb and Jesus’ post-resurrection appearances, is, of
course, universally recognized, but the myriad other contradictions and
disagreements in the accounts of Jesus’ words and deeds are more than simple
divergences in eyewitness testimony or imperfections in transmission. Since at
least the middle of this century, scholars have recognized that the
non-agreement between the evangelists, or between an evangelist and his sources,
is editorial, deliberate. That is, these writers were consciously redacting
their received material according to their own beliefs and purposes, while many
Gospel elements are recognized to be the evangelists’ own creation. It follows
that, if even the purported words of the Lord could be arbitrarily changed or
invented for tendentious reasons, there could be no thought of preserving
"history". These writers obviously looked upon their stories as artificial
products, designed for the needs of their own communities. Such insights have
led the last two generations of scholars (and more) to label the Gospels "faith
documents", not historical accounts.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">The second characteristic is the
dependence of so many elements of the Jesus story on passages and motifs from
the Jewish scriptures. The Passion story is a veritable pastiche of verses from
the Psalms, Isaiah and various other prophets. Overall, it represents the new
telling of a tale found repeatedly throughout the Hebrew bible and related
writings. Scholars call it The Suffering and Vindication of the Innocent
Righteous One. The story of Jesus’ fate follows in virtual lockstep this age-old
pattern, its details culled from scriptural passages. No history in view here.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">This process of mining the scriptures
was a reflection of a traditional Jewish practice known as "midrash", in which
the writer interpreted and enlarged upon individual or combinations of passages
from the bible to draw out new meanings and relevance, to offer a new truth for
contemporary times. One midrashic method was to refashion an existing biblical
narrative in a new setting. Thus Jesus was portrayed as a new Moses, with
features which paralleled the stories of Moses.</font>
<br><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="+1">John Shelby Spong (in his <i>
Liberating the Gospels</i>) regards the Synoptic Gospels as midrashic fiction in
virtually every detail, though he believes it was based on an historical man.
Spong, building on earlier research by Michael D. Goulder,<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#10">10</a></sup>
has argued that the Gospel story was designed to provide suitable lectionary
material for year-round Christian observances, based on the traditional cycle of
Jewish Sabbath and festival themes. This would entirely remove from the Gospels
any semblance of history.</font>[See the book review of Spong's <i>

<p><b><i><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman">Piece No. 9: A Diverse Patchwork</font></i></b>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">If Christianity is to be regarded as a
single movement, then it is a wildly schizophrenic one. The variety and scale of
response to one man defies explanation. The "cultic" expression, epitomized by
Paul, apparently abandoned all interest in the earthly life and identity of
Jesus and turned him into a cosmic Christ who created the world and redeemed it
by his death and resurrection. Individual communities like those responsible for
the Q document and the Gospel of Thomas, ignored that death and resurrection and
present a teaching Jesus, a preacher of the coming Kingdom of God. In what is
probably the earliest stratum of material in the Gospel of John, Jesus is a type
of "descending-ascending" redeemer from heaven who saves by being God’s revealer
(though he reveals nothing about him except that Jesus is his Son and
representative); later, John equates Jesus with the Greek Logos. In the Epistle
to the Hebrews, Jesus is the heavenly High Priest who offers his sacrifice in a
heavenly sanctuary, an expression of Alexandrian-style Platonism. In the
Didache, Jesus is reduced to a non-suffering intermediary servant/child of God.
He is presumed to lie behind the Wisdom-Word-Son mysticism of the Odes of
Solomon. In the diverse strands of Gnosticism, Jesus (or Christ) is a mythical
part of the heavenly pleroma of Godhead, sometimes a revealer akin to John’s,
sometimes surfacing under other names like Derdekeas or the Third Illuminator.<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#11">11</a></sup>
How many other forms of "Jesus" did not survive in extant documents is
impossible to tell, though Paul in his letters hints at divergent groups and
apostles all over the place, who "preach another Jesus" so different from his
own that he can lay curses upon them and accuse them of being agents of Satan.</font>
<br><p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Scholars like Burton Mack<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#12">12</a></sup>
think to find behind the Gospels and other documents all sorts of little groups
preserving and formulating this or that type of tradition about Jesus and
viewing him in different ways. The Jesus extracted from Q and assigned to a Q
community is only the most prominent of these. All this fragmentation of an
historical man, the breakup of Jesus into a multitude of component parts, is an
unprecedented phenomenon, and not only does no document exist which embodies
such a process or even gives a clue as to why it took place, each of these
component parts seems blissfully unaware of the others. Paul’s letters give no
hint that there were communities centered around the very elements of Jesus’
life and preaching which he had abandoned as of no interest. On the other hand,
communities like that of Q seem impervious to the cosmic dimensions which the
cultic circles have bestowed upon their preacher of the Kingdom. Only the
evangelists (which is to say, the first of them, Mark) thought to bring these
disparate elements together. The question is, where did all the various elements
come from, and were they associated with a human Jesus in their pre-Gospel
stages?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">[See
<a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/partthre.htm">Part Three: The
Evolution of Jesus of Nazareth</a>, and the book review of Burton Mack's <i>
<a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/review1.htm">Who Wrote the New
Testament?</a></i>]</font>
<p><b><i><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman">Piece No. 10: The Second Century</font></i></b>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">If the historical Jesus seems unknown
to all in the first century but the early evangelists (and, in a different
sense, the later redactors of Q), the first stirrings of a "knowledge" of an
historical Jesus emerge soon after the second century gets under way. Ignatius
in his letters (by tradition written around 107 while on his way to martyrdom in
Rome) offers the earliest non-Gospel reference to Jesus as a man born of Mary at
the time of Herod and crucified by Pontius Pilate. Shortly after, Tacitus’
reference appears, the first in non-Christian literature identifying Jesus as an
historical man who was executed at the time of Pilate. Polycarp (writing about
130?), reflects the same outlook as Ignatius, and the Epistle of Barnabas (c.
120?) seems to regard Jesus as an historical man, but the writer is still
dependent on scripture for much of what he assigns to this figure. If Eusebius
is to be relied upon, Papias too reflects a belief in an historical Jesus (in
Asia Minor), and he witnesses (at second hand) to some circulating collections
of sayings and possibly anecdotes that have become associated with this figure.</font>
<br><p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">And yet, there are major Christian
writings of the second century which fail to present an historical Jesus. Both
the Didache (which may have roots in the late first century) and the monumental
Shepherd of Hermas are devoid of any such figure; the latter never utters the
name Jesus. Even the New Testament epistles generally dated in the early second
century, 2 Peter and the three Pastorals, seem to lack an historical man. (The
sole reference to Pilate in the New Testament epistles, 1 Timothy 6:13, has been
examined with some suspicion by certain commentators<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#13">13</a></sup>,
since it doesn’t seem to fit the context well. I regard it, along with 1
Thessalonians 2:15-16, as an interpolation.)</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Most astonishingly, all the major
apologists before the year 180, with the sole exception of Justin (and a minor
apologist from Syria, Aristides), fail to include an historical Jesus in their
defences of Christianity to the pagans. This includes Tatian in his pre-<i>Diatessaron</i>
days. Instead, the apologists bear witness to a Christian movement which is
grounded in Platonic philosophy and Hellenistic Judaism, preaching the worship
of the monotheistic Jewish God and a Logos-type Son; the latter is a force
active in the world who serves as revealer and intermediary between God and
humanity. Theophilus of Antioch, Athenagoras of Athens, Tatian in his Apology,
Minucius Felix in Rome (or North Africa) offer no beliefs in an historical
figure crucified as an atoning act, nor in a resurrection. (Nor do they have
anything in common with Paul.) In not one of them does the name Jesus appear,
and none speak of an incarnation of their Logos. Theophilus explains the meaning
of the name "Christian" as signifying that "we are anointed with the oil of
God."</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Minucius Felix heaps scorn on any
doctrine of a crucified man as divine and redeemer (indicating that he is aware
of some who hold to such a thing), while Tatian alludes to "stories" told by
both Greeks and Christians, implying that both are of the same nature, mythical
tales not to be taken literally. Only Justin has embraced the story and the
figure as presented in some early form of written Gospel, but even he, in
recounting his conversion experience of a couple of decades earlier (<i>Dialogue
with Trypho</i>, 3-8), shows a telltale void about belief in an historical man
in the faith movement he joined. Into Trypho’s mouth (8:6) he places the
accusation that "you invent a Christ for yourselves."</font>

PROBLEM SOLUTIONS TO THE PUZZLE</font></b></center>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="+3">I</font><font size="+1">f these
are the salient pieces of the documentary record of the time, how have scholars
traditionally tried to put them together? Almost universally, they have taken
the figure of Jesus of Nazareth, which is attested to only in Gospels beginning
in the late first century, and placed him prior to the earliest records—the
letters of Paul and other epistles of the New Testament—which themselves contain
no sign of him. To compensate for this absence in the early record, they have
extracted elements from the Gospels and attempted to trace roots of these back
to the supposed time of Jesus, thinking to uncover words and deeds which can be
attributed to him. These attempted excavations will be evaluated later.</font></font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">But the other anomaly which scholars
have had to address is perhaps even more challenging. If Jesus died around 30
CE, and was no more than a charismatic preacher of the Kingdom (not too
charismatic, since he sank without a trace in all the non-Christian record of
the first century), how are we to explain the manner in which he is presented in
the earliest surviving Christian writings which begin no more than two decades
after his death, and which would seem to contain older elements reaching back to
a time when he had scarcely been laid in his grave?</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Scholars have long realized that early
Christian writers present us with a thoroughly divine Christ. They acknowledge
that Paul, together with the cultic circles he represents, has made a leap so
far beyond the human Jesus portrayed in the Gospels that the latter figure has
been completely lost sight of. Herman Ridderbos is only one of a multitude of
voices expressing the same resounding perplexity:</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">"No one who examines the Gospels...and
then reads the epistles of Paul can escape the impression that he is moving in
two entirely different spheres....When Paul writes of Jesus as the Christ,
historical and human traits appear to be obscure, and Christ appears to have
significance only as a transcendent divine being." (<i>Paul and Jesus</i>, p.3).
He goes on to ask: "Jesus was not dead the length of a human lifetime before his
stature was not only infinitely increased, but also entirely changed. How did
this come about?"</font>
<br><p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Others, such as Rudolf Bultmann,<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#14">14</a></sup>
have put the situation in different terms: that the early church almost
immediately lost all interest in the human life lived by its Master and placed
its entire focus on his nature and role as the Crucified and Risen Lord. Not
even the pinnacle of salvation history, the event of the cross, is located upon
the hill of Calvary, nor his resurrection placed in the context of an empty tomb
outside Jerusalem. Norman Perrin<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#15">15</a></sup>
has presented a picture of the early church which made no real distinction, he
says, between the historical Jesus and the exalted Christ, seeing both figures
as continuous. This made no clarification necessary between what Jesus on earth
had said and what he continued to say in his new spiritual state (an attempt to
explain why nothing of the former actually appears, stated as such, in the
record).</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">In all these scenarios, there are
difficulties which commentators have been reluctant to face, difficulties which
make many of their assumptions virtually impossible.</font>
<p><b><i><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman">Against the Jewish Grain</font></i></b>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">The first difficulty is that the vast
majority of the earliest Christians were, of course, Jews. "God is One," says
the most fundamental of Jewish theological tenets. Moreover, the Jewish mind had
an obsession against associating anything human with God. He could not be
represented by even the suggestion of a human image, and Jews in their thousands
had bared their necks before Pilate’s swords simply to protest against the
mounting of military standards bearing Caesar’s image within sight of the
Temple. The idea that a man was a literal part of God would have been met by any
Jew with horror and apoplexy.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">And yet we are to believe that Jews
were immediately led to elevate Jesus of Nazareth to divine levels unprecedented
in the entire history of human religion. We are to believe not only that they
identified a crucified criminal with the ancient God of Abraham, but that they
went about the empire and practically overnight converted huge numbers of other
Jews to the same outrageous—and thoroughly blasphemous—proposition. Within a
handful of years of Jesus’ supposed death, we know of Christian communities in
many major cities of the empire, all presumably having accepted that a man they
had never met, crucified as a political rebel on a hill outside Jerusalem, had
risen from the dead and was in fact the pre-existent Son of God, creator,
sustainer, and redeemer of the world.</font>
<br><p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Since many of the Christian
communities Paul worked in existed before he got there, and since Paul’s letters
do not support the picture Acts paints of intense missionary activity on the
part of the Jerusalem group around Peter and James, history does not record who
performed this astounding feat.<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#16">16</a></sup>
</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Moreover, it was apparently done
without any need for justification. There is not a murmur in any Pauline letter,
nor in any other epistle, that Christians had to defend such an outlandish
doctrine. No one seems to challenge Christian preaching on these grounds, for
the point is never addressed. Even in 1 Corinthians 1:18-24, where Paul defends
the "wisdom of God" (meaning the message he preaches) against the "wisdom of the
world", he fails to provide any defense for, or even a mention of, the elevation
of Jesus of Nazareth to divinity. He can admit that to the Greeks and Jews the
doctrine of the cross—that is, the idea of a crucified Messiah—is "folly" and "a
stumbling block." But this has nothing to do with turning a man into God, a
piece of folly he never discusses or defends. That his opponents, and the Jewish
establishment in general, would not have challenged him on this basic Christian
position, forcing him to provide some justification, is inconceivable.</font>
<p><b><i><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman">A Reticent Preaching Movement</font></i></b>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Could any apostle have maintained such
a silence in his missionary activities? If Paul were preaching a man who was
God, would not his listeners and converts have demanded to know about the life
of this man, his sayings and deeds? Whether Paul liked it or not, the human
Jesus would have become a focus of discussion between himself and his
congregations, details of which would certainly surface in his letters. None do.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Paul could hardly have set out on a
career to bring the message about Jesus to the gentile all across the known
world without possessing a certain amount of information about the man he
intended to preach. Yet what effort did he make to acquire such information?
During the first 17 years following his conversion, and after waiting three of
those years, he spent exactly two weeks in Jerusalem with the men who had
presumably known Jesus in his ministry and were the custodians of that
information. All he did at the time, so he tells us (Galatians 1:18-19), was
"get to know Peter" and see James. Did they give him a crash course in their
memories of Jesus’ life and ministry? Paul gives no hint of such a thing, and no
details are ever relayed to his readers.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Christianity was in competition with
the Graeco-Roman mystery cults, with many salvation messages spread by wandering
philosophers and devotees of the cultic gods. An important benefit offered by
these deities was protection against the evil spirits. Yet the pseudo-Pauline
Colossians and Ephesians, which have a special interest in these matters, fail
to point out that, unlike the other savior deities, Christ had been incarnated
in flesh and blood in recent history. He had experienced and countered such
demonic forces first hand, on earth. He had demonstrated his power over them
through his miracles, exorcising them from sick people. In his ministry, Jesus
had shown compassion, tolerance, generosity, all those things men and women
thirsted for in confronting a hostile, uncaring world. It is simply unthinkable
that Paul or anyone else would ignore or lose interest in all these advantages
of the human Jesus when presenting to their listeners, gentile or Jew, the
Christian agent of salvation.</font>
<p><b><i><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman">Starring Jesus in a Mythological
Drama</font></i></b>
<br><p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Robert Funk, founder of the Jesus
Seminar, in his <i>Honest to Jesus</i>,<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#17">17</a></sup>
is at pains to point out that Christianity developed as a clash between "the
cult of Christ" and "the gospel of Jesus." Paul is supposed to have been the
main culprit in creating the former and blocking access to the latter. Funk
admits that the cultic branch is entirely mythic in character, that it was
strongly influenced by scripture and hellenistic savior cult ideas of a
dying/rising god. Yet how could hellenistic mythological ideas<i> </i>have made
such strong and sudden inroads into the thinking of those who followed the human
Jesus? What, in anyone’s mind, would a counter-culture preacher of the Kingdom,
executed by the Roman authorities for some kind of perceived subversion,
possibly have had to do with mythic savior gods and world redemption which could
have led anyone to cast him so thoroughly in this mold—to the exclusion of all
trace of the preaching original?</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Scholars have long tried to offer
scenarios to explain this process. One runs like this: In their fervor and
distress following the crucifixion, the followers of Jesus scrambled to
understand what had just happened, to interpret the meaning of their Master’s
life, to put a name to his role in God’s plan. They ran to their bibles and
began to apply all manner of scriptural passages to him, especially those looked
upon as messianic by the Jewish thinking of the time. But they turned as well to
contemporary hellenistic mythology about the Logos, supplementing it with the
Jewish equivalent in the figure of personified Wisdom, throwing in for good
measure dim (to us) myths about descending-ascending heavenly redeemers. Those
early Christian thinkers absorbed all this vast cultural pleroma and decided
that their Jesus of Nazareth had in fact been the true embodiment of all these
myths and proceeded to pile them, willy-nilly, upon him. This "morning after"
ransack of current philosophy and the Jewish scriptures led, so they say, to the
highly elevated, mythological picture created of Jesus so soon after his death,
and to a conviction that he had been "resurrected".</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">The first thing we have to ask
ourselves is: who did all this? It was hardly a circle of simple fishermen
around Jesus, like Peter or the sons of Zebedee, who as the Gospels portray them
could probably barely read, let alone turn themselves practically overnight into
Philonic-type exegetes of the Septuagint and contemporary Greek philosophy. If
it was Paul alone, how could he ever have worked with the Jerusalem circle of
apostles? In fact, his letters show no dispute on such a score; he enjoyed close
contact and cooperation with the group around Peter, even if it could sometimes
be an uneasy relationship. If it was a larger circle of more sophisticated minds
of which Paul’s is the only name to come down to us, one perhaps based in
Antioch as some suggest: whatever gave such a group the impetus to do this? To
apply to a crucified preacher whom they had never personally experienced, the
loftiest philosophical and religious concepts of their day? And where is the
evidence for the split which would surely have taken place in the early
Christian movement between such head-in-the-clouds philosophers and a simpler
core of disciples who had followed the human Jesus and heard him preach, a
preaching in which he would scarcely have presented himself in these terms?
There is not the slightest evidence of any disagreement in the ranks over such
mythologizing tendencies.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">This raises another question. How is
one to explain how all this mythologizing of a recent man gained such wide
acceptance? It might be one thing to say that certain followers of Jesus
(whoever they may have been) were so immersed in religious arcana as to see
nothing unusual in casting their Master in these mythological terms. It is quite
another to understand how the average man or woman who was approached with a
Christian message like this could so readily embrace it. Such claims for a
recent man (who hardly claimed such things for himself), especially one executed
as a subversive, would have been met with laughter or blank stares—as, no doubt,
would the claim that he had risen from his tomb. What could possibly explain why
so many apparently made such a bizarre leap of faith?</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Even if such mythological motifs were
current in the cultural consciousness of the day, how difficult would it be to
persuade the hearer that all these myths, hitherto familiar in a spiritual
context only, should now be applied to a human being—a crucified criminal? Early
Christian preaching would have had to center around the justification for all
this, yet this is precisely what is missing from the earliest correspondence.</font>
<p><b><i><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman">One-Sided Interpretations</font></i></b>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Scholars have had a traditional way of
describing the application of philosophical and scriptural content to Jesus in
the early literature, from Hebrews’ High Priest making the sacrifice of his own
blood in the heavenly sanctuary to Paul’s pre-existent Son. This, they say, was
an "interpretation" of the man and the role he was now seen to have played. But
how are we to understand an "enterpretation" when the thing being interpreted is
never mentioned?</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Suzanne Lehne, for example, in her
study of Hebrews (<i>The New Covenant in Hebrews, </i>p.27), explains that
scripture helped the author "articulate his beliefs" about "the Christ event."
But nowhere in Hebrews does the author intimate that he is articulating any
historical Christ event, and in fact, a reference in scripture is usually
treated as though it is <i>part </i>of that event, not an explanation of
something else, let alone recent history. It is from scripture that the "event"
of Christ has been constructed; these are not "proof-texts" but "source-texts".</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">John Knox, in <i>Myth and Truth</i>
(p.59), explains Ephesians 1:3-10 as a kind of hymn created to explain Jesus in
entirely supernatural terms. He speaks of "the remembered man Jesus," and "the
wonder of his deeds and words." But where are these things in Ephesians 1:3-10
or anywhere else? We cannot accept Knox’s claim that the myth in Ephesians is
built upon "historical data" when that data is never pointed to. A better
explanation would be that the historical data has been added to the myth at a
later time. Knox, like New Testament scholarship in general, is guilty of
reading into the early Christian mythological presentation of the divine Christ
the historical context derived from the later Gospels. The Christ myth as an
interpretation of an historical event is a fantasy.</font>
<p><b><i><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman">New Forays into Christian
Origins</font></i></b>
<br><p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Newer scenarios about how the
Christian movement began and how Jesus became the Christ have attempted to be
more subtle and comprehensive. Burton Mack suggests<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#18">18</a></sup>
that, in addition to Galilean groups who regarded Jesus as no more than a human
teacher, gentile circles in places like Antioch were responsible, over a period
of time, for applying current mythological interpretations to Jesus of Nazareth,
and that Paul was converted to one of these "cults". But this scenario has
problems. Jews still made up a sizeable component of the community in Antioch.
Did they simply allow gentiles to persuade them to betray the most cherished
principles of their Jewish heritage? The idea of gradual evolution (Mack
suggests it took place over a period of 25 years) is belied by pre-Pauline
elements like the hymn of Philippians 2:6-11, which are likely, as Mack admits,
very early developments. As for Paul himself (according to information in
Galatians<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#19">19</a></sup>),
his conversion was also too early to allow the time needed for such processes to
take place, especially in distant centers. And are we to believe that he too—a
Jew born and bred, so he tells us—swallowed the blasphemous proposition that a
man was God, as a result of some gentile sucker-punch? Even among those
gentiles, such an elevation of a human man would have been unprecedented and far
from easy.</font>
<br><p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">For we must still answer the question
"why". What would have led Paul, or gentiles off in northern Syria, to take a
simple preacher, whom they knew only by report, and turn him into a cosmic
deity, no matter what their diet of hellenistic mystery ideas? The appeal could
not have been in his message and charisma as a teacher, since they immediately
stripped off this skin and discarded it. If Paul had no interest in the teacher
and his teachings, of what use was this Jesus to him as a candidate for divine
redeemer? Both Mack and Robert Funk<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#20">20</a></sup>
speak of the Pauline cult’s point of departure as the fact of Jesus’ "noble
death", but noble deaths are common enough in history, including Jewish history,
and rarely if ever do they lead to divinization on so exalted a scale. The
simple fact of a reputed noble death would hardly have led an educated,
observant Jew like Paul to contravene the most sacred precepts of his heritage
and associate this particular man, one he had never met, with God.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">In any event, the cultic presentation
of Jesus’ crucifixion does not fit the "noble death" scenario. The latter is
classically of the warrior or teacher who dies for his country, his followers,
his teachings. These things focus on a life, a cause: in Judaism, it is
invariably for the sake of the Law. This is precisely what is missing in the
Christ cult, which has nothing to do with Jesus’ life, teachings or followers.
Dying for sin is not in the same category, especially when placed in the spirit
realm; this is a mystical, spiritual concept.</font>
<p><b><i><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman">Listening For a Footstep . . .</font></i></b>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">It would seem that the
"straightforward proposition" with which this article began is not compatible
with Piece No. 2, "A Transcendent Christ", for no feasible path can be traced
from the presumed historical Jesus to the earliest expression (as a cosmic
redeeming deity) found about him in the early Christian record. No acceptable
explanation can be found for why such a leap would have been made in the first
place, who made it, how Jewish sensibilities could have been overcome, and why
in the process the human man who presumably started it all would have completely
disappeared into a black hole.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">When we add Piece No. 3, "A Time of
Revelation", we find that Paul and others are, in fact, making it impossible to
assume that they identify the beginning of the faith movement with an historical
man. Through passages like Romans 16:25, Colossians 1:26, Ephesians 3:5, etc.,
they tell us that this is a time of revelation about the Son through the medium
of the Spirit and the holy scriptures. These secrets "hidden for long
generations" are only now being unveiled to the world through apostles like
Paul, not through any historical Jesus.</font>
<br><p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">In 2 Corinthians 5:18, Paul tells his
readers: "From first to last this has been the work of God,<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#21">21</a></sup>
who has reconciled us to himself through Christ, having given us the ministry of
reconciliation." It is apostles like Paul who have been "entrusted by God with
the message of reconciliation" (v.19). That Paul is not sharing the limelight
with any recent Jesus of Nazareth and <i>his</i> ministry is also borne out in
an earlier passage, with not even a "through Christ" to temper the personal
eulogy. It begins (3:5-6): "Such qualification as we have comes from God; it is
he who has qualified us to dispense his new covenant."</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Paul’s total disregard for the role of
Jesus himself in dispensing the new covenant is astounding. But he goes on to
say that the old covenant had been inaugurated with divine splendor, as
reflected in the face of Moses. He asks, "Must not even greater splendor rest
upon (be reflected in) the divine dispensation of the Spirit?" Paul has passed
over any splendor which might have been contained in the face of Jesus and his
career, and settles on that of the missionary movement, impelled by the Spirit
sent from God. "How much more," he asks, "shall the ministry of righteousness"
—meaning his own ministry— "abound in glory?" (Here my translation.) "The
splendor that once was (i.e., in the old covenant) is now...outshone by a
splendor greater still." To this mansion of glory in which Paul has taken up
residence, Jesus is not even let in by the servants’ entrance!</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Such passages ignore any role Jesus
might have played in recent salvation history, but what of those which leave
absolutely no room for it? Titus 1:3, speaking in Paul’s name, is a good
example: "Yes, it is eternal life that God, who cannot lie, promised long ages
ago, and now in his own good time he has openly declared himself in the
proclamation which was entrusted to me by ordinance of God our Savior." There is
not a crack in this facade where Jesus could gain a foothold. In the past lie
God’s promises of eternal life, and his first action on those promises is the
present revelation to apostles like Paul who have gone out to proclaim the
message. Jesus’ own proclamation of eternal life, his own person as the
embodiment of that life (as the Gospel of John so memorably puts it), has
evaporated into the wind.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">1 Peter (1:12) declares that the
things the prophets told of have now been announced, not by Jesus in his own
ministry, but "by those preaching the gospel in the power of the Holy Spirit
sent from heaven." Titus 2:4 and 3:4 speak of what has "dawned upon the world"
in the present. Rather than Jesus himself, it is "the grace of God" and "the
kindness and generosity of God our Savior." Scholars, when they have allowed
themselves to worry about such things, declare these to be metaphorical
references to Jesus of Nazareth. This is an interpretation born of desperation.</font>
<p><b><i><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman">. . . And a Voice</font></i></b>
<br><p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">If the movement began with a man who
preached on earth, we are at a loss to explain how even the simple knowledge or
presentation of this feature cannot be found in any early strand of the
documentary evidence. Compounding this puzzlement is the presence in many
epistles of moral teachings and maxims familiar from the Gospel record
(including some of Q’s "authentic" sayings), yet without the slightest
attribution to its Jesus figure.<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#22">22</a></sup>
From the Beatitudes to pronouncements on love, to judging and oaths and
approaching God and loving enemies and turning the other cheek, not to mention
dozens of apocalyptic sentiments which are found in Jesus’ mouth in the Gospels,
none are presented as the voice of Jesus. Some are said to come directly from
God, as in 1 Thessalonians 4:9, while others (such as Paul’s "words of the
Lord") are regarded as the product of inspiration from the spiritual Christ in
heaven. Scholarly commentaries are full of expressions of surprise and
perplexity on all this silence about the product of the teaching Jesus.<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#23">23</a></sup>
</font>
<br><p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">A quick look at Romans 10 and 11
should convince any unprejudiced observer that Paul knows of no historical
preaching Jesus. (I’ll leave it to the reader to consult this passage.) He seeks
to emphasize the Jews’ guilt in not responding to the message delivered by
apostles like himself, even though they have had every opportunity to do so. And
yet he fails to include the opportunity offered by Jesus’ very own person and
preaching. Several points in 10:11-21 cry out for some reference, some hint, of
the historical ministry, yet none is forthcoming.<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#24">24</a></sup>
Paul then goes on in chapter 11 to refer to the longstanding myth of the Jews
killing their prophets sent from God, yet not a murmur is heard of the killing
of the Son of God himself. Nothing can explain away these silences.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">The Epistle to the Hebrews opens with
the statement that "in this final age (God) has spoken to us through the Son,"
and then proceeds to give us not a word spoken by this Son—at least not in any
historical, earthly setting. Rather, the Son’s voice comes out of the sacred
writings; scripture is his platform. In 10:5 the Son speaks in a kind of
"mythical present" through a passage from Psalm 40 (actually, 39 LXX).</font></p>
<ul>
	<p><font size="+1">“<font face="Times New Roman">That is why, at his coming
	into the world, he says:<br>
	‘Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire,<br>
	But thou hast prepared a body for me.<br>
	Whole-offerings and sin-offerings thou didst not delight in.<br>
	Then I said:</font>“<font face="Times New Roman">Here am I: as it is
	written of me in the scroll,<br>
	I have come, O God, to do thy will..</font>”<font face="Times New Roman"> ’
	</font>”</font></p>
</ul>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">In this one passage we can see the
type of source which gave rise to the idea that the spiritual Son had taken on
or entered "flesh" (at first this was envisioned within the lower spiritual
realm: see Piece No. 5), and the idea that this Son had undergone sacrifice. For
the writer of Hebrews, Christ’s was the ultimate sacrifice which would supplant
once for all the sacrifices of the Temple cult which God no longer wanted. The
idea of "his coming into the world" is not presented in any historical sense,
much less in the context of a Gospel story, but scholars have often struggled to
try to relate these verses to an earthly incarnation. Paul Ellingworth however,
realizes that the "he says" is "a timeless present referring to the permanent
record of scripture."<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#25">25</a></sup>
This removes it from any historical context.</font>
<br><p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">We are skirting Platonic ideas here,
with their concept of a higher world of timeless reality. It is in this
spiritual world that Christ operates, as Hebrews’ portrayal of the sacrifice
offered in the heavenly sanctuary clearly indicates. The "coming into the world"
is still a mythical one, as is the idea of operating "in flesh".<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#26">26</a></sup>
</font>
<br><p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">In the same vein, Ephesians 2:17 is
especially interesting. "And coming, he (Christ) proclaimed the good news..."
But what was the content of that news? Instead of taking the opportunity to
refer to some teachings of Jesus’ presumed ministry, the writer quotes Isaiah.
(Even the introductory phrase quoted above is based on Isaiah 52:7.) Like
Hebrews, the Son is envisioned as speaking through the sacred writings. The Son
inhabits the spiritual world of the scriptures, God’s newly-opened window onto
the unseen true reality.<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#27">27</a></sup>
It is the "coming" of that voice, perceived through revelation and a fresh
reading of scripture, which has launched the new age and the Christian movement.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="+3">W</font><font size="+1">e are
led to conclude that the beginning of the Christian movement was not a response
to any human individual at one time and location. Christianity was born in a
thousand places, out of the fertile religious and philosophical soil of the
time, expressing faith in an intermediary Son who was a channel to God,
providing knowledge, love and salvation. It sprang up in many innovative minds
like Paul’s, among independent communities and sects all over the empire,
producing a variety of forms and doctrines. Some of it tapped into traditional
Jewish Messiah expectation and apocalyptic sentiment, other expressions were
tied to more Platonic ways of thinking. Greek mystery concepts also fed into the
volatile mix. Many groups (though not all) adopted the term "Christ" for their
divine figure, as well as the name "Jesus", which in Hebrew has the meaning of
"Savior". Paul and the Jerusalem brotherhood around Peter and James were simply
one strand of this broad salvation movement, although an important and
ultimately very influential one. Later, in a mythmaking process of its own, the
Jerusalem circle with Paul as its satellite was adopted as the originating cell
of the whole Christian movement.</font></font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">But there was another factor involved.
New reform impulses and moral concerns were in the air as well, both as part of
the many manifestations of the Christ movement and on their own among other,
non-cultic circles who preached a coming End-time and transformation of the
world. All these groups tended to produce ethical teachings, parables of the
Kingdom, stories of conflict experiences. In the end, this increasing store of
sectarian expression impelled the creation of a new, artificial figure: the one
who had originated such things. Within the cultic movement, this process
eventually led to the Proclaimed being brought to earth and turned into the
Proclaimer.</font>
<br><p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">That such teaching and Kingdom
material had originally nothing to do with any one individual, much less a Jesus
of Nazareth, is a possibility yet to be addressed by New Testament scholarship,
and thus the search for the "genuine" historical Jesus as preacher and prophet
goes on.<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#28">28</a></sup>
The Jesus Seminar and others have declared him unearthed from the roots of Q, a
first century document produced by Jewish circles in Galilee preaching the
Kingdom of God.</font>
<p><b><i><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman">Excavating the Q Foundations</font></i></b>
<br><p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">The modern analysis of Q<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#29">29</a></sup>
as an evolutionary accumulation of three differentiated layers of material, is
undoubtedly reliable. Yet it offers us a Jesus who is an anomaly: a Jewish
preacher who yet shows no interest in things Jewish, for in the so-called Q1
layer, we hear a cosmopolitan, very un-Jewish voice, one that bears a strong
resemblance to Cynic preaching and practice; this was a Greek counterculture
movement of the time spread by wandering Cynic sages.<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#30">30</a></sup>
Moreover, these sayings sound like the product of a school or lifestyle,
developed over time and hardly the sudden invention of a single mind. When
certain Q1 material turns up in other venues (with the exception of the Gospel
of Thomas: see below), it is never attributed to a Jesus but seems (as Laws
observes) to be part of a general stock of ethical material, probably adopted by
many reform-minded groups during this period. If a real man were the source of
this teaching and the impulse to the formation of a preaching movement, why does
he come down to us in such a meager, tortuous fashion?</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">We need to be suspicious also at the
about-face evidenced by the Q2 material. From teachings which seem so
cosmopolitan, open-minded and full of visions of the ideal society, not to
mention so lacking in Jewish orientation and concerns, how does the community
proceed, within supposedly only a few years, to the harsh, punitive,
narrow-minded apocalyptic fulmination of the Q2 sayings, whose atmosphere and
interests are quite definitely of a Jewish and sectarian nature? Does this not
point to the strong possibility that the Q1 material comes from an external
source, adopted (and perhaps adapted) by a Q community which turns out not to be
quite so admirable and visionary as starry-eyed commentators would like to
portray them? The common explanation that tensions resulting from rejection
caused this about-face do not seem to be adequate, especially to account for the
stark shift to Jewish apocalypticism.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">There are other telltale signs in the
second layer of Q that all this condemnation was originally directed at a
failure to respond to the community’s preaching of the Kingdom, not to the
teaching or person of Jesus. The apocalyptic Son of Man sayings are not
identified with Jesus, which is why, when they were later placed in his mouth,
Jesus sounds as though he is talking about someone else. John the Baptist in the
Q2 layer (3:7-19) prophecies an eschatological judge, not a teacher-founder
Jesus. The saying found in Luke 16:16 is especially revealing: "Until John there
was the Law and the prophets; since then, there is the good news of the kingdom
of God." This, like so much of Q, is acknowledged to be a product of the
community’s own experience and time (i.e., not going back to Jesus), and yet no
reference to Jesus himself has been worked into this picture of the change from
the old to the new. Luke 11:49 also leaves out the Son of God when speaking of
those whom Wisdom promised to send.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">In fact, that verse and others point
to the source of the Q1 sayings as perceived by the later community. They were
the product of, or inspired by, personified Wisdom. The Q1 stage is recognized
as "sapiential," that is, an instructional collection in the same genre as
traditional "wisdom" books like Proverbs. John is identified as a "child of
Wisdom", and so was Jesus (Lk. 7:35) when he was introduced into the picture:
see below.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Commentators like Mack have attempted
to explain why Q contains no hint of Jesus’ death, let alone a resurrection. All
fall back on the idea that news of such an event did not reach them in Galilee,
or that it held no interest for them. Neither explanation is acceptable. The
group which "remained" in Jerusalem is said to have had roots in Galilee which
would certainly have remained active. And if there is one prominent motif to be
found in Q’s second layer, it is the theme of the killing of the prophets. Had
the founder’s fate been execution, there is no way this would not eventually
have been seized on and incorporated into the community’s consciousness. The
alternative (something Mack tentatively suggests) is that there was no death—at
least not a memorable one, no execution by the authorities at all. Of course,
this places the burden on the cultic side of things: if Jesus died a natural
death, what historical fuel drove Paul and his fellows to build their mythic
crucifixion? An impossible situation either way.</font>
<p><b><i><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman">Filling In the Gaps</font></i></b>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">One of the great anomalies in Q is the
lack of any contexts for the majority of its sayings. The few that have them can
be located in the Q3 layer. For every single Q1 and Q2 saying, Matthew and Luke
have been forced to provide their own contexts and set-up lines within their
picture of Jesus’ ministry. Not even something like the Lord’s Prayer is given a
common setting between the two Synoptic evangelists. If the community had
associated these sayings with a Jesus right from the beginning, and taking into
account the amount of redaction the document underwent through its various
stages, it is virtually impossible that over the course of time some of these
would not have had little context references added to them (whether accurately
preserved or simply invented), so that Matthew and Luke would betray some
presence of such things. Only a handful of anecdotes, like the dialogue between
Jesus and John, or the Capernaum miracle, show any such development, and these
bear signs of being late, of tendentious redaction. They are composite
creations, put together out of earlier discrete units.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">This can be illustrated by a
comparison with the Gospel of Thomas. This too presents itself as a collection
of sayings attributed to Jesus and has been enlisted in support of the
'discovery' of Jesus at the roots of Q. Thomas shows far less development than
Q. Most of its sayings are prefaced only by a simple "Jesus said," while a few
have scraps of set-up lines. Like Q, it contains no death and resurrection
motifs.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">But there is some form of relationship
between the two documents, and since the Gospel of Thomas contains the more
primitive form of those sayings they hold in common, most of which are located
at the Q1 level, we can deduce that the roots of Thomas split off from Q at an
early stage of Q development (or possibly vice-versa). The identification with
Jesus could have been added at any later time in reaction to the widespread
development of an historical figure, probably some time in the first half of the
2nd century. (The unearthed copy of Thomas is based on a Greek version which
goes back to the mid second century.)</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Thomas confirms that the evolution of
Q involved stages of considerable recasting, including joining individual
sayings into dialogues and anecdotes (a common practice of the period). A simple
saying in Thomas, #78, where it would seem to refer to Jesus, appears in Q in an
extended construction, the dialogue between Jesus and John (Lk. 7:18-35), where
it is made to apply to John. This is a dead giveaway that the Q pericope is an
invention. The set of three chreic responses in Q1 (Lk. 9:57-62) are similarly
shown to be later redacted units.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Thus, all the signs point to no Jesus
in the earlier layers of Q.</font>
<p><b><i><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman">Q’s Founder Emerges</font></i></b>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">When and why did the idea of a founder
figure emerge in the Q community’s thinking? It appeared at the Q3 level, when
certain dialogue, pronouncement and miracle anecdotes were constructed or
revamped from earlier material to embody him, and minor changes were made to
some individual sayings to reflect his voice.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Reform impulses and apocalyptic
expectations are things which solidify groups of like-minded people into sects,
set against the wider world around them which largely rejects such extreme
messages and thus receives the sect’s condemnation. Q2 preserves the community’s
hostile reaction to rejection, and even Paul itemizes the suffering he has
endured at the hands of those unreceptive to his gospel. When groups become more
sectarianized, certain social phenomena take place. Attitudes of "inside" and
"outside" solidify. A bulwark is created to defend against attack. Community
practices need to be justified, and the beliefs of those who now consider
themselves an elect must be supported.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Thus the sect’s view of its theology
and history tends to evolve to serve the primary purpose of filling its needs as
a distinct and isolated social group. The past is reconstructed to render it
sacred. Current faith and teaching, ritual and practice, are bolstered by
showing that such things had been there from the beginning, that they had been
formulated under divine auspices, in inspiring circumstances, and preferably by
a heroic founder figure with a pipeline to the deity—perhaps even sent by, or a
part of, the deity itself.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">This process can be seen in the
evolution of Q. Q1 is a body of Cynic-style material, probably ultimately from a
Greek source. Perhaps Mack is right in postulating a cosmopolitan Galilee, a
strongly hellenistic environment in which certain Jewish circles began preaching
the Kingdom. Here Jews could absorb foreign ideas without difficulty, and may
have adopted Greek Cynic material as providing a suitable ethic for their
Kingdom movement.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">However, opposition from an
unreceptive environment soon led to the formulation of prophetic and
condemnatory sayings, together with little anecdotes (also of a Cynic nature)
embodying the conflict between sect and establishment. Q2 added the darker side
of sectarianism and apocalyptic expectation to the original body of enlightened,
cosmopolitan material. No Jesus had yet spoken such things. This was still a
record of the community’s own teachings and articulated stance toward others.
And the sect may originally have regarded itself as spokespersons for the Wisdom
of God. Her presence within the community’s thinking is revealed by Luke in
11:49: "That is why the Wisdom of God said..." Instead of "Jesus said" at the
earlier stages of Q, it may have been "Wisdom said".</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">That chink left open by Luke may well
reveal the entire early landscape of Q, a landscape empty of any Jesus figure at
all, peopled by a preaching movement inspired from heaven and working under
Wisdom’s direction. As she had done throughout Israel’s past, Wisdom had sent
this culminating wave of messengers to proclaim God’s salvation, and as in the
past, they had received hostility, rejection, even death.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">But Wisdom was not the ideal founder
figure, for she was only a spiritual entity. What the Q community needed was a
human, heroic progenitor, one who had actually spoken the sayings, done the
deeds, set the precedents. The very existence of the sayings collection would
have invited attribution to an originating and authoritative figure. And so,
Wisdom was transformed into her ideal representative, a "child of Wisdom".
Matthew in his use of Q reflects a further evolving attitude to Jesus as the
very incarnation of Wisdom herself, and many of Jesus’ sayings in Q are
recognized as borrowed Wisdom sayings.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">But this founder figure was not yet
cast as divine, and the term "Christ" is never used of him. He is not envisioned
as the Messiah, though he takes on the identity of "the coming one" when he
becomes associated with the Son of Man, and there seem to be intimations of
divinity which come in at the final phase of Q in the form of the Temptation
Story. Nor is he a redeemer, for there is no soteriology attached to Jesus in
any stage of Q. He is simply a glorified embodiment of the Q preachers
themselves, doing what the Q people had done from the beginning, only better. He
opened the door for men and women’s entry into the new Kingdom.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Of course, John the Baptist had to be
realigned, and so he was recast as the forerunner, the herald to whom the
founder Jesus had been superior. This would also put the rival followers of John
the Baptist (by now perhaps a separate sect) in their place. This rivalry,
together with the fact that John had not been known as a Wisdom teacher, may
have precluded any tendency to make John himself the founder of the Q sect.</font>
<p><b><i><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman">Q and the Gospels</font></i></b>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">How do we relate the latest phase of Q
to the developing Gospels? On one level and in the same manner as Q, the Gospels
are creations motivated by the sectarian needs discussed above. They are
foundation documents which embody the principles of the sect’s faith and
practice and its stance toward the outside world. That "foundation" is
fictionalized in a mythic tale about a founder figure, a tale which does two
things: it translates the redeeming spirit-realm activities of its deity into an
earthly setting, and it adds the epitomization of the work and beliefs of the
Markan community itself, focusing these on its Jesus of Nazareth.</font>
<br><p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">The Markan Jesus, as intermediary Son
and Redeemer, has been drawn from the cultic Christ of the Pauline type
(although there seems to be no direct use of the specific ideas of Paul, unless
the Lord’s Supper myth has come from Paul through indirect channels). This makes
it likely that the Markan community was a cultic group to begin with.<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#31">31</a></sup>
But Mark also betrays Q-like traditions, and a debate still rages as to whether
he also had access to some form of Q, or perhaps had come in oral contact with
members of the Q community.<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#32">32</a></sup>
</font>
<br><p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">The key question then becomes: did
Mark, in casting his Christ in a human character and local setting, draw on
recently developed conceptions about a founder figure in the Q community? Did
the Q Jesus serve as a model or inspiration for Mark’s Jesus of Nazareth?
Without a copy of the Q document itself, Mark may have had little of substance
about this figure to draw on, and thus we find the curious paucity of teachings
in Mark’s Gospel,<sup><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#33">33</a></sup>
and the absence of almost any of the Q anecdotes incorporated by Matthew and
Luke.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">In any event, the Q traditions lacked
biographical and contextual elements, so Mark had only scripture to draw on for
detail to flesh out his Jesus "biography". This, as modern scholarship has come
to realize, was founded on the principles of midrash and modelled on the story
of the Suffering Righteous One. It is very possible that Mark, and perhaps
Matthew and Luke (and even John), regarded their midrashic tale as symbolic
only, and its Jesus figure as not historical. In such a state, these early
versions of the Gospels would have remained in that limbo for a generation or
more, undisseminated beyond their own communities, until wider forces and new
interpretations led the evangelists’ Jesus of Nazareth out onto the historical
stage.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Finally, it has been suggested that
various first century preacher/Zealots and would-be Messiah figures who agitated
for revolutionary or apocalyptic change, and were usually dispatched by the
military authorities (perhaps one was even executed by Pilate!), provided a
partial model for the creation of Mark’s Jesus figure, or perhaps even that of Q
at some stage. But this is a far cry from saying that the Gospel Jesus
represents an historical figure in any meaningful fashion, or that thereby we
can say that "there was an historical Jesus."</font>
<p><b><i><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman">An Unresolved Question</font></i></b>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">As a final consideration, I might
suggest that the situation between Mark and Q could be even more complex. Most
scholars find some echo in Mark of Q ideas and experiences. But could the
influence have extended in the other direction, too? Q surfaces for the first
time in Matthew and Luke, likely after the turn of the second century. What
recent revisions and additions might have been made to it? (It is thought the
two evangelists used different "editions" of Q.) There is no necessity to assume
they are resurrecting some document that had been dead or fixed for several
decades. This line of approach may also help solve the one intriguing question
where my view of Q is concerned.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Why should the invented Q founder,
with no connection to the cults of Paul or the usual savior concepts, have been
named Jesus—which has the meaning of "savior" and the echo of divinity?</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Was the term so widespread among
Jewish sectarian circles that it exercised a compelling attraction on the
Kingdom-preaching community in Galilee? This would imply that the Q people,
perhaps in the decade or so following the Jewish War, were by that time aware of
the spiritual Christ cults flourishing in the wider world, and thus of the
higher significance of the name. If so, did this impel that move toward divinity
discernible in the final phase of Q3?</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Or could, perhaps, the latest stage of
Q postdate the earliest phase of Mark, and had there been crossover influences?
As part of this question, we would then ask: had Q3 used the name "Jesus" at
all?</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Even if it nowhere appeared in the
text, even if another designation had been used by the Q3 redactors in passages
like the dialogue between Jesus and John, Matthew and Luke, under the influence
of Mark and because they were not conscious of reproducing history, would have
changed it to Jesus.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">But there is another possibility. It
is not improbable that some intervening hand, before the later Synoptics came to
be written, had already altered Q3’s original designation for its founder to fit
a deepening trend: the near-universality of the name Jesus among a host of
apocalyptic and salvation sects. Perhaps this had been done under the influence
of a newly-minted Mark. Perhaps the altering hand was someone who saw the Q
document as a surviving record, or a related account—historical or otherwise—of
the humanized divine Christ of the Gospel of Mark.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">A written Q, in fact, may finally have
found its way to the Markan community and after minor alterations, rested for a
time on the same shelf as the recently constructed Gospel. It was left to a
later evangelist in a neighboring community to amalgamate the two after copies
reached him by the same post, so to speak. Some years after that, another
evangelist, this one a little further away perhaps, whose community had
different, more gentile interests, got wind of the two documents, arranged for
copies and did his own reworking.</font>

Oracles of the Lord Interpreted</i> had contained quotations from such Gospels,
later commentators, like Eusebius and Philip of Side, would certainly have
referred to them. Nor is it likely that if he had full narrative Gospels of
Jesus’ life Papias would have disparaged written works and preferred oral
traditions, as he is reported to have said. Papias tells, in the fragments
quoted by Eusebius, that his information about "Mark" came from "the Presbyter",
but whether this was also the case concerning "Matthew" Eusebius is not clear,
though it is likely. All Papias witnesses to (assuming we can trust Eusebius) is
that a couple of decades or so into the second century, there were certain
circulating collections of sayings and possibly anecdotes, probably of a
prophetic nature, one of them in Hebrew or Aramaic, which had begun to be
attributed to an historical Jesus and associated with the names of early reputed
followers of him.</font>

<p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman"><sup>23</sup> Perhaps no attempt to
explain this is as mind-boggling as that of Sophie Laws in her study <i>The
Epistle of James</i> (p.34): "Whereas the Gospels have one form of adoption of
Jesus’ teaching, in that they identify it as his, James provides evidence of
another way of retaining and preserving it: absorbed without differentiation
into the general stock of ethical material." What are we to call this:
"preservation by burial"?! James has covered over the traces so well one wonders
how later generations were able to unearth it. Laws’ bland statement that "It is
not important to James to indicate where his precepts derive from Jesus,"
explains nothing and only highlights the sheer absurdity of the idea. Laws is in
good company with such as Peter H. Davids (<i>James</i>, p.16), who boldly
states: "The non-citation of Jesus even when dependent on his thought, is fully
characteristic of the New Testament epistles." Davids draws on other silences to
prove that the silence in James is not a silence at all!</font>

is an objective genitive, supported by the entire context. See C. K. Barrett’s
attempt (<i>The<b> </b>Epistle<b> </b>to<b> </b>the<b> </b>Romans</i>, p.189) to
introduce a preaching Jesus alongside the apostolic preachers into a little
relative pronoun in verse 14. <i>Hou ouk ekousan</i>, he says,<i> </i>should be
translated as meaning "Christ must be heard either in his own person, or in the
person of his preachers." Barrett’s claim, which no one to my knowledge agrees
with, destroys Paul’s finely-created chain of argument. Barrett is letting what
he cannot believe is missing override what is clearly there—or not there—in

<p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman"><sup>26</sup> Hebrews 10:37 makes it
clear that "the coming one" has not come previously, for scripture’s promise has
not yet been fulfilled. And 8:4 virtually spells out that Christ had never been
on earth. (Ellingworth, op.cit., p.405, shies away from this conclusion by
rejecting the normal interpretation of the imperfect verbs, since "it could be
misunderstood as meaning that Jesus had never been to earth"!) As for 9:28,
which scholars are willing to say is the only spot in the New Testament epistles
where the Parousia is spoken of as a <i>second </i>coming, the "<i>ek deuterou</i>"
can instead be taken as meaning "next" in a sequential sense, and not
necessarily "a second time"; in fact, the context of v.27-28 supports the
former. [See Supplementary Article No. 9:

<p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman"><sup>27</sup> Since the higher realm
of spirit constituted the "true" reality, that upper world contained the
spiritual counterparts of things material in the world below. Thus within the
spirit realm Christ could take on the equivalent of "flesh", make a "blood"
sacrifice, even be "of David’s stock" as in Romans 1:3. Note that this feature
of Christ "<i>kata sarka</i>" is determined by scripture, as Paul tells us in
verse 2. It is on the prophets, not known historical fact, that Paul has founded
his "gospel of the Son", and his activities in both "flesh" and "spirit". [See
Supplementary Article No. 8:

(e.g., by E. P. Sanders in his <i>Jesus and Judaism</i>) that Jesus’ teaching,
especially that considered most probably authentic by modern scholarship, was
hardly of a nature to prompt the authorities to execute him. Sanders, too,
points out that such teaching did not have a Jewish focus, much less an
apocalyptic one; neither did it call for the repentance or restoration of
Israel. This fundamental incompatibility between the "teaching" side of the
Gospel story and the "Passion" side is strong evidence that the one originally
had nothing to do with the other, but were brought together artificially.</font><a href="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm#28b"><img src="http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/arrow.gif" border=0 height=18 width=17></a>
