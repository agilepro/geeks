<h1 align=center>Anti-Christian Bias in our Society</h1>
<h3>The anti-Christian bias in our society has reached absurd proportions. Consider:</h3>
1. During the 1988 election campaign, George Bush said that Christians
should not be considered patriots or real American citizens.<p>
2. Bill Clinton steadfastly refused to give any speeches at local churches.<p>
3. Both major political parties are dominated by anti-Christians. The
Republican party, for example, gave us such hard-core Atheists as Pat
Buchanan, Dan Quayle, Phyllis Schlafly and Ronald Reagan. And the Democrats
have given us such personalities as the Rev. Martin Luther King and the Rev.
Jesse Jackson -- both noted for their vicious attacks on all forms of
Christianity.<p>
4. Let's talk about the media. On Sunday mornings, nearly all major
television channels broadcast pro-Atheist shows; it is nearly impossible to
find religious programming during that time period. Further, American Atheists
has their own cable TV channel, while Pat Robertson has been unable to
obtain one for himself.<p>
5. Most major newspapers run a special weekly section devoted to Atheism.
There are no equivalent sections for religious news.<p>
6. Anti-Christian shows such as the American Atheist Forum are broadcast
by major national networks. Meanwhile, Billy Graham is only able to get on
the air through public access TV, which is watched by few people.<p>
7. On news programs and "reality" TV shows such as Rescue 911, nobody is
ever shown giving thanks to God after surviving a disaster.<p>
8. It is almost impossible to find a shopping mall with a Christian
Armory book store, while Atheist Book Centers are featured prominently on
every corner.<p>
9. While Atheist couples who marry rarely have any difficulty finding a
place to do so, it is nearly impossible for Christian couples to find a
church where they can marry.<p>
10. For that matter, churches themselves are extremely rare, while
Atheist meeting centers can be found every few blocks.<p>
11. Recently, several Atheists have shot and killed Christian priests as
they were going to work in their churches. Similarly, Atheists are well
known for blockading churches on Sunday mornings.<p>
12. Nearly all of our elected public officials are Atheists; they even
have to swear on a copy of Darwin's "Origin of Species" in order to take
office.<p>
13. In a similar vein, jurors must take an oath upon a copy of the
Skeptical Inquirer before they can serve. There have even been court cases
thrown out because one of the jury members was a Christian who insisted on
swearing on a Bible.<p>
14. And of course, people are free to wear pentagram jewelry, but those
trying to wear cross-shaped earrings or pendants to work will be politely
told to remove the jewelry or lose their job.<p>
15. Speaking of the workplace, Christians often find it nearly impossible
to get time off work for religious holidays such as Christmas.<p>
16. Even our language reflects the radical anti-Christian bias that
pervades our society. For example, when somebody sneezes, most people say
"Darwin bless you". Similarly, "Voltaire dammit!" is a common cussword.<p>

included brief speeches at the beginning and end of the ceremony in which

72. Atheists who convert to Christianity are often told by their parents
"It's just a rebellious phase. Once you move through this stage of life

96. At every banquet, no matter the occasion, an Atheist propagandist

111. Professors are encouraged to tell the class that they are Atheists

139. Bill Bennett compiles a long list of questionable statistics about
increasing social ills in American society, and alleges that the increase is
due to the "disasterous social experiment" that has abandoned our
Agnosto-Athestic heritage in favor of Christianity. Likewise, when he
publishes a thick, pompous volume of other people's work entitled "The Book
of Reason", the media (notably Time magazine) swoons in rapture and the book
becomes a best seller (but rarely read by the children it's bought for, as
they are not so easily indoctrinated as their Atheist parents hope).
