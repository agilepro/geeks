<b>May 18, 2006</b> — The feet of human embryos taking shape in
the womb reveal links to prehistoric fish and reptiles, a new
study finds.
<p>Human feet may not look reptilian once babies
emerge from the womb, but during development the appendages
appear similar to prehistoric fish and reptiles. The finding
supports the theory that mammalian feet evolved from ancient
mammal-like reptiles that, in turn, evolved from fish.
<p>It also suggests that evolution -- whether that of a species
over time or the developmental course of a single organism --
follows distinct patterns.
<p>In this case, the evolution of mammalian feet from fish fins
to four-legged reptiles to four-limbed mammals to human feet
appears to roughly mirror what happens to a maturing human
embryo.
<p>"Undoubtedly there are clear parallels between the
mammal-like reptilian foot and the human foot," said Albert
Isidro, an anthropologist at the Autonomous University of
Barcelona, Spain and lead author of the study, which appeared in
the journal <i>The Foot</i>.
<p>Isidro and colleague Teresa Vazquez made the determination
after analyzing fossils of a number of mammal-like reptiles that
lived from 75 to 360 million years ago. The scientists also
studied fossils of osteolepiform fish, which appear to be half
fish and half reptilian. These fish lived 400 million years ago
and had lungs, nostrils and four fins located where limbs would
later be found in four-footed reptiles and mammals.
<p>In 33-day-old human embryos, the scientists observed "the
outline of a lower extremity in the form of a fin, similar to
that seen in osteolepiform fishes." As the embryo continued to
develop, the researchers focused their attention on two foot
bones: the calcaneous, or heel bone, and the talus, which sits
between the heel and the lower leg.
<p>At 54 days of gestation, these two bones sit next to each
other as they did within the reptile herbivore <i>Bauria cynops</i>,
which lived around 260 million years ago. This ancient reptile
had flat, crushing teeth and mammalian features.
<p>At eight and a half weeks of gestation, the researchers found
the two embryonic foot bones resemble those seen in the
Diademodon vegetarian dinosaur, which lived around 230 million
years ago.
<p>"We can tell that the embryo is half way between the reptiles
and the mammals (at this stage)," Isidro told Discovery News.
<p>The two foot bones continue to develop until, at nine weeks,
they resemble that of placental mammals as they emerged 80
million years ago.
<p>This development of feet in the human embryo mirrors how the
foot evolved over millions of years beginning with fish and
ending with early mammals, according to the scientists.
<p>Supporting the fish/foot link was the discovery last month of
a new species, <a href=MissingLink.htm><i>Tiktaalik roseae</i></a>, which lived 375 million
years ago. It had fish fins and scales, but also limb parts
found in four-legged animals.
<p>"Tiktaalik blurs the boundary between fish and land-living
animals both in terms of its anatomy and its way of life," said
Neil Shubin, professor and chairman of organismal biology at the
University of Chicago and co-author of a related paper in the
journal Nature.
<p>H. Richard Lane, director of sedimentary geology and
paleobiology at the National Science Foundation, said, "These
exciting discoveries are providing fossil ‘Rosetta Stones’ for a
deeper understanding of this evolutionary milestone: fish to
land-roaming tetrapods (four limbed animals)."
