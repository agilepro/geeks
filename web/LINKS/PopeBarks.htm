<p><i>The bestselling author of “The End of Faith”
responds to Pope Benedict XVI’s speech on the interplay
between faith and reason. Harris: “It is ironic that a
man who has just disparaged Islam as ‘evil’ and
‘inhuman’ before 250,000 onlookers and the world press,
is now talking about a ‘genuine dialogue of cultures.’&nbsp;”</i>

<br>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>The world is still talking about the pope’s
<a title="recent speech" href="http://zenit.org/english/visualizza.phtml?sid=94748">
recent speech</a>—a speech so boring, convoluted and
oblique to the real concerns of humanity that it could
well have been intended as a weapon of war. It might
start a war, in fact, given that it contained a
stupendously derogatory appraisal of Islam. For some
reason, the Holy Father found it necessary to quote the
Emperor Manual II Paleologos, who said: “Show me just
what Muhammad brought that was new and there you will
find things only evil and inhuman....” Now the Muslim
world is buzzing with pious rage. It’s a pity that Pope
Benedict doesn’t also draw cartoons. Joining a craven
chorus of terrified supplicants, The
<a title="New York Times has urged him" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/16/opinion/16sat2.html">
New York Times has urged him</a> to muster a “deep and
persuasive’’ apology. He now appears to be
mincing his way toward the performance of just such a feat.
<p>While the pope succeeded in
enraging millions of Muslims, the main purpose of
his speech was to chastise scientists and secularists
for being, well, too reasonable. It seems that
nonbelievers still (perversely) demand too much
empirical evidence and logical support for their
worldview.&nbsp; Believing that he was cutting to the quick
of the human dilemma, the pope reminded an expectant
world that science cannot pull itself up by its own
bootstraps: It cannot, for instance, explain why the
universe is comprehensible at all. It turns out that
this is a job for… (wait for it) … Christianity. Why is
the world susceptible to rational understanding? Because
God made it that way. While the pope is not much of a
conjurer, many intelligent and well-intentioned people
imagined they actually glimpsed a rabbit in this old
hat. Andrew Sullivan, for instance, praised the pope’s
“deep and complicated” address for its “clarity and
openness.” Here is the heart of the pope’s argument,
excerpted from his concluding remarks. I have added my
own commentary throughout.
<p><b>“The intention here is not one of retrenchment or
negative criticism, but of broadening our concept of
reason and its application. While we rejoice in the new
possibilities open to humanity, we also see the dangers
arising from these possibilities and we must ask
ourselves how we can overcome them. We will succeed in
doing so only if reason and faith come together in a new
way, if we overcome the self-imposed limitation of
reason to the empirically verifiable, and if we once
more disclose its vast horizon....”</b>
<p>The pope suggests that reason should be broadened to
include the empirically unverifiable. And is there any
question these new “vast horizons” will include the
plump dogmas of the Catholic Church? Here, the pope gets
the spirit of science exactly wrong. Science does not
limit itself merely to what is currently verifiable. But
it is interested in questions that are potentially
verifiable (or, rather, falsifiable). And it does mean
to exclude the gratuitously stupid. With these
distinctions in mind, consider one of the core dogmas of
Catholicism, from the Profession of Faith of the Roman
Catholic Church:<br><b><br>
“I likewise profess that in the Mass a true, proper, and
propitiatory sacrifice is offered to God on behalf of
the living and the dead, and that the Body and the
Blood, together with the soul and the divinity, of our
Lord Jesus Christ is truly, really, and substantially
present in the most holy sacrament of the Eucharist, and
there is a change of the whole substance of the bread
into the Body, and of the whole substance of the wine
into Blood; and this change the Catholic Mass calls
transubstantiation. I also profess that the whole and
entire Christ and a true sacrament is received under
each separate species.”</b>
<p>While one can always find a Catholic who is reluctant
to admit that cannibalism lies at the heart of the
faith, there is no question whatsoever that the Church
intends the above passage to be read literally. The real
presence of the body and blood of Christ at the Mass is
to be understood as a material fact. As such, this is a
claim about the physical world. It is, as it happens, a
perfectly ludicrous claim about the physical world.
(Unlike most religious claims, however, the doctrine of
Transubstantiation is actually falsifiable. It just
happens to be false.) Despite the pope’s solemn
ruminations on the subject, reason is not so elastic as
to encompass the favorite dogmas of Catholicism.
Needless to say, the virgin birth of Jesus, the physical
resurrection of the dead, the entrance of an immortal
soul into the zygote at the moment of conception, and
almost every other article of the Catholic faith will
land in the same, ill-dignified bin. These are beliefs
that Catholics hold without sufficient reason. They are,
therefore, unreasonable. There is no broadening of the
purview of 21st-century rationality that can, or should,
embrace them.
<p><b>“Only thus do we become capable of that genuine
dialogue of cultures and religions so urgently needed
today....”</b>
<p>It is ironic that a man who has just disparaged Islam
as “evil” and “inhuman” before 250,000 onlookers and the
world press is now talking about a “genuine dialogue of
cultures.” How much genuine dialogue can he hope for?
The Koran says that anybody who believes that Jesus was
divine—as all real Catholics must—will spend eternity in
hell (Koran 5:71-75; 19:30-38). This appears to be a
deal-breaker. The pope knows this. The Muslim world
knows that he knows it. And he knows that the Muslim
world knows that he knows it. This is not a good basis
for interfaith dialogue.
<p><b>“In the Western world it is widely held that only
positivistic reason and the forms of philosophy based on
it are universally valid. Yet the world’s profoundly
religious cultures see this exclusion of the divine from
the universality of reason as an attack on their most
profound convictions. A reason which is deaf to the
divine and which relegates religion into the realm of
subcultures is incapable of entering into the dialogue
of cultures....”</b>
<p>Astrologers don’t like “their most profound
convictions” attacked either. Neither do people who
believe that space aliens have traversed the galaxy only
to molest ranchers and their cattle. Happily, these
groups do not take to the streets and start killing
people when their irrational beliefs are challenged. I
suspect that the pope would be the first to admit that
there are millions of people on this Earth who harbor
“most profound convictions” that are neither profound
nor compatible with real dialogue. Indeed, one doesn’t
even need to read between the lines of his speech to
glean that he would place the entire Muslim world beyond
the “universality of reason.” He is surely right to be
alarmed by Islam—particularly by its doctrines of
martyrdom and jihad. He is right to find the treatment
of Muslim women throughout the world abhorrent (if,
indeed, he does find it abhorrent). He is right to be
concerned that any Muslim who converts to Christianity
(or to atheism) has put his life in jeopardy, as
conversion away from the faith is punishable by death.
These profundities are worthy objects of our derision.
No apologies necessary, Your Holiness.
<p>We might, however, note in passing that one of the
pope’s “most profound convictions” is that contraception
is a sin. His agents continue to preach this diabolical
dogma in the developing world, and even in sub-Saharan
Africa, where over 3 million people die from AIDS each
year. This is unconscionable and irredeemably stupid. It
is also a point on which the Church has not shown much
of an intelligent capacity for dialogue. Despite their
inclination to breed themselves into a state of world
domination, Muslims tend to be far more reasonable on
the subject of family planning. They do not consider the
use of temporary forms of birth control to be a sin.<br>
<b><br>
“Modern scientific reason quite simply has to accept the
rational structure of matter and the correspondence
between our spirit and the prevailing rational
structures of nature as a given, on which its
methodology has to be based. Yet the question why this
has to be so is a real question, and one which has to be
remanded by the natural sciences to other modes and
planes of thought—to philosophy and theology....”</b>
<p>This may have been where Sullivan found the Holy
Father to be particularly “deep and complicated” and
“profound.” Granted, questions of epistemology can make
one sweat, and there are many interesting and even
controversial things to be said about the foundations of
our knowledge. The pope has not said anything
interesting or controversial here, however. He has
merely insinuated that placing the God of Abraham at the
back of every natural process will somehow reduce the
quotient of mystery in the cosmos. It won’t. Nearly a
billion Hindus place three gods—Brahma (the Creator),
Vishnu (the Preserver) and Shiva (the Destroyer)—in the
space provided. Just how intellectually illuminating
should we find that?
<p><b>“The West has long been endangered by this
aversion to the questions which underlie its
rationality, and can only suffer great harm thereby. The
courage to engage the whole breadth of reason, and not
the denial of its grandeur—this is the program with
which a theology grounded in Biblical faith enters into
the debates of our time. “Not to act reasonably, not to
act with logos, is contrary to the nature of God”, said
Manuel II, according to his Christian understanding of
God, in response to his Persian interlocutor....”</b>
<p>Please read that first sentence again. I hope it
doesn’t seem peevish to point out that the West faces
several dangers even greater than those posed by an
incomplete epistemology. The West is endangered,
primarily, by the religious fragmentation of the human
community, by religious impediments to clear thinking,
and by the religious willingness of millions to
sacrifice the real possibility of happiness in this
world for a fantasy of a world to come. We are living in
a world where untold millions of grown men and women can
rationalize the violent sacrifice of their own children
by recourse to fairy tales. We are living in world where
millions of Muslims believe that there is nothing better
than to be killed in defense of Islam. We are living in
a world in which millions of American Christians hope to
soon be raptured into the sky by Jesus so that they can
safely enjoy the holy genocide that will inaugurate the
end of human history. We are living in a world in which
a silly old priest, by merely giving voice to his
religious inanities, could conceivably start a war with
1.4 billion Muslims who take their own inanities in
deadly earnest. These are real dangers. And they are not
dangers for which more “Biblical faith” is a remedy.
