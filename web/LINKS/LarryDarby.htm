<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Judges
took proper stand on pledge </span></b><o:p></o:p></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Rabid theists have decried
a federal court’s long overdue and proper ruling that the words “under God” in
the loyalty oath are unconstitutional. Two brave, patriotic judges took
rightful steps to halt the deterioration of religious liberty in America,
guaranteed by the Bill of Rights, specifically by the constitutional principle
of separation between government and religion.

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>That government should
endorse religion, in any sense, is conspicuously absent from the Constitution.

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Another supreme law of the
land, the Treaty with Tripoli, reads, “As the government of the United States
of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian Religion ...”

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The writings of Jefferson,
Madison, Washington and Adams show our nation was intended to be free from the
quagmire of faith-based governments of Europe, spawned from the Dark Age of
Catholic domination.

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>American citizens need
neither a loyalty oath nor an official religious slogan. Congress must act now
to restore “E Pluribus Unum” and simultaneously remove “God” from currency.

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>American atheists
challenged the government’s religious sloganeering in 1978. In O’Hair vs.
Blumenthal, the court opined, “Its use is of a patriotic or ceremonial character
and bears no true resemblance to a governmental sponsorship of religious
exercise.”

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Ceremonial deism and
religious sloganeering subvert the Constitution because they are coercive acts
by government, forcing 26 million atheist Americans to daily acknowledge the
state God. Subversion of the Constitution is not just an attack on the American
way of life, but an attack on the foundation of our government.

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>That, citizens, is
treasonous.
