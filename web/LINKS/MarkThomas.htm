Re: saying "under God" in our Pledge of Allegiance<br>
<br>
You say that a reference to God is not religious, but merely a traditional reference to a higher power,<br>
and does not suppress someone's religious or non-religious beliefs.<br>
<br>
First, any reference to God, gods, Yahweh, Zeus, or Brahma IS religious in nature, and thus respects<br>
an establishment of religion.<br>
<br>
Second, continuing an action or way of thinking simply
because it is traditional is insufficient reason.<br>
If Americans had followed this form of logic, we would have had no revolution, no emancipation of the<br>
slaves, and no suffrage for women.&nbsp; Until 1954, it was also traditional to not have "under God" in our<br>
Pledge of Allegiance.<br>
<br>
Third, any reference to a higher power is a reference to God or gods (ignoring the trivial concepts of<br>
higher power meaning nature or something within the
individual).<br>
<br>
Fourth, referring to God DOES suppress someone's religious
or non-religious beliefs -- if those beliefs<br>
are not monotheistic.<br>
<br>
What part of the First Amendment is confusing? "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment<br>
of religion..."<br>
<br>
Most God-believing people should be loudly protesting the
trivialization of God that you and many other<br>
government officials are espousing.
&nbsp; They probably won't, because it serves their
interest of inserting more<br>
religion into our government.<br>
<br>
Our nation was founded as the first country that derived its
power from a purely secular, nonreligious basis.&nbsp;<br>
It is true patriotism to fight to keep it that way.<br>
<br>
As shown by this national uproar and debate, religion is
divisive.&nbsp; The Pledge of Allegiance is supposed to<br>
help unite Americans.&nbsp;
Having "God" in it divides us. Let's return the Pledge to its
previous form, so we can<br>
ALL once again say "one nation, indivisible, with
liberty and justice for all."<br>
<br>
I have collected a list of excellent web articles on
this.&nbsp; I urge you to educate yourself on
this important issue.<br>

<br>
Dear Mark,<br>
<br>
Thank you for contacting me to express your support of the Ninth Circuit<br>
Court of Appeals' ruling on the Pledge of Allegiance.<br>
<br>
In a two to one decision in Newdow vs. U.S. Congress, the Ninth Circuit<br>
Court of Appeals held that the words "under God" in the Pledge of<br>
Allegiance and a California's school district policy which requires<br>
teachers to lead willing school children to recite the Pledge of<br>
Allegiance every day, violates the Establishment Clause of the First<br>
Amendment.<br>
<br>
The House of Representatives passed House Resolution 459 which expresses<br>
the sense of the House that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals erroneously<br>
decided Newdow vs. U.S. Congress. The Resolution also states that the<br>
phrase, "one nation, under God," should remain in the Pledge of Allegiance<br>
and that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals should agree to rehear the<br>
ruling in order to reverse the decision.&nbsp; I voted for the Resolution<br>
<br>
I believe in the separation of Church and State and that government should<br>
not endorse religion.&nbsp; However, I think that in this case reciting the<br>
Pledge of Allegiance does not suppress someone's religious or<br>
non-religious beliefs because the Pledge has become a traditional, not<br>
religious, reference to a higher power.<br>
<br>
I appreciate hearing from you and ask you to continue to inform me on<br>
issues you care about.&nbsp; I always need and welcome the benefit of your<br>
thoughts and ideas.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
Anna G. Eshoo<br>
Member of Congress<p></div>

<h3>LTE published in the San Jose Mercury News, August, 2004</h3>
Susan Bentley, in her letter of July 30, said that this nation was founded
on biblical principles.&nbsp; This is untrue.<p>

One of the founding principles of America is freedom of religion.&nbsp; This
includes freedom from religion, because everyone has the right to say no to
other religions.&nbsp; Our founding fathers understood the need for this, and
carefully kept religion out of our government.&nbsp; They even put this in the
1797 Treaty of Tripoli, which stated, "The Government of the United States
is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion."<p>

We all have the right to think whatever we want, including prayer.&nbsp; For many
Christians, freedom of religion isn't enough.&nbsp; They seem to want their
religion forced on others by the government and in schools.&nbsp; This is
un-American and antithetical to our pluralistic society.<p>

<h3>Op-ed piece published in the San Jose Mercury News, June, 2004</h3>

<h2>Freedom of Religion and the Pledge of Allegiance</h2>
The U.S. Supreme Court recently declined to rule on the merits of having the phrase “under God” in our Pledge of Allegiance.&nbsp; This is disappointing because there are many reasons to keep religion and government separate.<p>

Two hundred and fifteen years ago our Constitution took effect, creating a new kind of government.&nbsp; The United States of America was founded as the first country that derived its power from a purely secular, nonreligious basis.&nbsp; Nations before then had kings and queens who used their supposed “God-given divine right” to rule.&nbsp; Instead of this top-down power structure, our founders wisely created a government that derived its powers from the consent of the governed.&nbsp; They also realized the inherent dangers of religion, and specifically kept it out of our Constitution and government.&nbsp; While the deists' “Nature's God” is mentioned in the Declaration of Independence, there is no reference to a god in the Constitution.&nbsp; In addition, the Treaty of Tripoli, written during the administration of President George Washington, signed by President John Adams and unanimously approved by the Senate in 1797, stated, “The Government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion.”&nbsp; Six years later James Madison wrote, “The purpose of separation of church and state is to keep forever from these shores the ceaseless strife that has soaked the soil of Europe in blood for centuries.”<p>

Our Constitution is also designed to protect the rights of the minorities from the tyranny of the majority.&nbsp; References to God by our government officials imply that the 14% of Americans who don't believe in any god are lesser citizens.&nbsp; This is similar to when white men once discriminated against blacks, women and other minorities, often using the Bible as an endorsement.&nbsp; It wasn't right then.&nbsp; It isn't right now.<p>

Almost two years ago, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled correctly on the inserted reference to God in the Pledge of Allegiance, saying that it conflicts with the First Amendment.&nbsp; To those who disagree, I ask, “What part of the First Amendment is confusing?”&nbsp; “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...”<p>

Enshrined in the First Amendment is the idea that all Americans have a constitutional right to freedom of religion.&nbsp; This must include freedom from religion, because we can’t have true freedom unless we have the right to choose “none of the above.”&nbsp; References to a god in the Pledge of Allegiance, our national motto, our national anthem, or on our money respect an establishment of religion, and thus are unconstitutional.<p>

Freedom of religion is an ideal that is held by most Americans -- from the devoutly religious to the devoutly nonreligious.&nbsp; However, many religious fundamentalists are battling to insert their religion into our government, to turn the U.S. into a theocracy.&nbsp; This mixing of government and religion is a threat to the freedoms of us all.&nbsp; Make no mistake about this.&nbsp; The United States cannot be based on the belief that all persons are created equal when it implies that a god prefers some.<p>

As shown by the national uproar and debate, religion is still divisive.&nbsp; The Pledge of Allegiance is supposed to help unite Americans.&nbsp; Having “God” in it divides us, and attempts to link patriotism to public professions of religious belief.&nbsp; Let us return the Pledge to its previous, nonreligious and inclusive form -- so we can all once again say “one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.”<p>
