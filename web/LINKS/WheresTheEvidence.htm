April 9, 2006<p><h1>Where's the Evidence?</h1>by Sam Harris<p>
<em>Religion loomed large last week, whether in the continued violence in
Iraq, or in the world's fascinated response to the unveiling of the
1,700-year-old Judas Gospel. But humanity must, ultimately, abandon faith
for reason, argues Sam Harris in <a href=http://www.truthdig.com/dig/item/200512_an_atheist_manifesto>"Imagine There's No Heaven: An Atheist
Manifesto,"</a> on the Web site TruthDig (www.truthdig.com). Harris is the
author of "The End of Faith," which won the PEN Award for nonfiction in
2005.</em>
<p>Religion is the one endeavor in which us-them thinking achieves
a transcendent significance. If a person really believes that calling God by
the right name can spell the difference between eternal happiness and
eternal suffering, then it becomes quite reasonable to treat heretics and
unbelievers rather badly. It may even be reasonable to kill them. If a
person thinks there is something that another person can say to his children
that could put their souls in jeopardy for all eternity, then the heretic
next door is actually far more dangerous than the child molester. â€¦
<p>Religion is only area of our discourse in which people are systematically
protected from the demand to give evidence in defense of their strongly held
beliefs. And yet these beliefs often determine what they live for, what they
will die for, and - all too often - what they will kill for. This is a
problem, because when the stakes are high, human beings have a simple choice
between conversation and violence. Only a fundamental willingness to be
reasonable - to have our beliefs about the world revised by new evidence and
new arguments - can guarantee that we will keep talking to one another.
Certainty without evidence is necessarily divisive and dehumanizing. While
there is no guarantee that rational people will always agree, the irrational
are certain to be divided by their dogmas.
