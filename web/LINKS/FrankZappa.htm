"Tax the FUCK out of the churches!"<br>
 -- Frank Zappa<p>

"Beware of the fish people, they are the true enemy."<br>
 -- Frank Zappa, speech to a pro-choice rally in Los Angeles around 1989-90<p>

"The language and concepts contained herein are guaranteed not to cause<br>
eternal torment in the place where the guy with the horns and pointed stick<br>
conducts his business."<br>
 -- Frank Zappa<p>

"I don't think there's a problem. First of all, I don't think music turns people<br>
into social liabilities. Because you hear a lyric -- there's no medical proof<br>
that a person hearing  a lyric is going to act out the lyric.  There's also no<br>
medical proof that if you hear any collection of vowels and consonants, that<br>
the hearing of that collection is going to send you to Hell."<br>
 -- Frank Zappa, interview, WRIF, 1985<p>

"It has never mattered to me that thirty million people might think I'm wrong.<br>
The number of people who thought Hitler was right did not make him right...<br>
Why do you necessarily have to be wrong just because a few million people<br>
think you are?"<br>
 -- Frank Zappa, quoted from The Real Frank Zappa Book<p>

"Well, I believe that those energies and processes exist. I just don't think<br>
that they've been adequately described or adequately named yet, because<br>
people are too willing to make it all into something that supports a<br>
religious theory of one flavor or another. If you start defining these<br>
things in nuts-and-bolts scientific terms, people reject it because it's not<br>
fun, y'know. It takes some of the romance out of being dead ... because of<br>
people's desires to have eternal life and to extend their influence from<br>
beyond the grave ... all that Houdini type stuff ... but basically, I think<br>
when you're dead ... you're dead. It comes with the territory."<br>
 -- Frank Zappa, Society Pages No. 7, January 12, 1991, quoted from The Way I See It<p>

"Barry, there is no hell. There is only France."<br>
 -- Frank Zappa, You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore<p>

"The other factor that people forget about the southern region is the amount<br>
of intermarriage that has already occurred there, and so there are certain<br>
genetic defects come to the fore when you have a large intermarriage<br>
population. That means regression.... And in fact Utah is another state,<br>
which is basically owned by the Mormon church, which also has a lot of<br>
intermarriage. And because this type of intermarriage there is a large<br>
proportion of blind people in Utah. That's why when you go across the street<br>
instead of just a stop light that you can see, they have stop lights that<br>
make a coocoo noise to tell you when to cross the street -- that's true!"<br>
 -- Frank Zappa, Arf Society interview, quoted from The Way I See It<p>

"Barry, remember there's a big difference between kneeling down and bending over."<br>
 -- Frank Zappa<p>

"The whole foundation of Christianity is based on the idea that<br>
intellectualism is the work of the Devil. Remember the apple on the tree?<br>
Okay, it was the Tree of Knowledge. "You eat this apple, you're going to be<br>
as smart as God. We can't have that."<br>
 -- Frank Zappa<p>

The essence of Christianity is told us in the Garden of Eden history. The<br>
fruit that was forbidden was on the Tree of Knowledge. The subtext is, All<br>
the suffering you have is because you wanted to find out what was going on.<br>
You could be in the Garden of Eden if you had just kept your fucking mouth<br>
shut and hadn't asked any questions."<br>
 -- Frank Zappa, interview, Playboy, May 2, 1993<p>

"So, when Adam and Eve were in the Garden of Eden, if you go for all these<br>
fairy tales, that "evil" woman convinced the man to eat the apple, but the<br>
apple came from the Tree of Knowledge. And the punishment that was then<br>
handed down, the woman gets to bleed and the guy's got to go to work, is the<br>
result of a man desiring, because his woman suggested that it would be a<br>
good idea, that he get all the knowledge that was supposedly the property<br>
and domain of God. So, that right away sets up Christianity as an<br>
anti-intellectual religion. You never want to be that smart. If you're a<br>
woman, it's going to be running down your leg, and if you're a guy, you're<br>
going to be in the salt mines for the rest of your life. So, just be a dumb<br>
fuck and you'll all go to heaven. That's the subtext of Christianity."<br>
 -- Frank Zappa<p>

"Anybody hear the great news, today? Jimmy Swaggart under investigation! Oh<br>
Ja-eezus! One day every one of those cocksuckers will get caught! I<br>
understand in the case of Mr. Swaggart, that he claims that it was not<br>
multiple encounters with many prostitutes -- apparently, only one sweet<br>
young thing. And he did tell Cal Thomas of the Moral Majority that the sex<br>
act itself was not fully consummated. However he did admit to doing something<br>
por-no-graphic with the girl. Let's use our imaginations, ladies and gentlemen.<br>
 -- Frank Zappa, opening remarks to "Stink Foot" at the Make A Jazz Noise<p>

Here show, recorded in 1988 Get smart and I'll fuck you over -- sayeth The Lord."<br>
 -- Frank Zappa, regarding Christianity's perpetuation of ignorance as a way of life<p>

"Children are naïve -- they trust everyone. School is bad enough, but, if you<br>
put a child anywhere in the vicinity of a church, you're asking for trouble."<br>
 -- Frank Zappa<p>

"From the time Mr. Developing Nation was forced to read The Little Red<br>
Book in exchange for a blob of rice, till the time he figured out that<br>
waiting in line for a loaf of pumpernickel was boring as fuck, took about<br>
three generations... Decades of indoctrination, manipulation,<br>
censorship and KGB excursions haven't altered this fact: People want a<br>
piece of their own little Something-or-Other, and, if they don't get it,<br>
have a tendency to initiate counterrevolution."<br>
 -- Frank Zappa<p>

"My best advice to anyone who wants to raise a happy, mentally healthy child<br>

 -- Frank Zappa<p>

"Yeah, I tell them to change the channel if they see some guy in a brown suit<br>
with a telephone number at the bottom of the screen asking for money."<br>

 -- Frank Zappa, on being asked by Joan Rivers why he gave his children such odd<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; names People make a lot of fuss about my kids having such supposedly 'strange names'<p>

 -- Frank Zappa, in 1988 Scientology<p>

dangerous than songwriters who celebrate sexuality."<br>
 -- Frank Zappa, Statement to the Senate Hearing on "Porn Rock," 1985<p>

"The establishment of a rating system, voluntary or otherwise, opens the door<br>
to an endless parade of moral quality control programs based on things<br>
certain Christians do not like. What if the next bunch of Washington wives<br>

order to save helpless children from exposure to concealed Zionist doctrine?"<br>
 -- Frank Zappa, Statement to the Senate Hearing on "Porn Rock," 1985<p>
