<h1>Starving Third World Masses Warned<br>Against Evils Of Contraception</h1>
<p>SÃO PAULO, BRAZIL—During a visit to the teeming slums of São Paulo Monday, Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua warned the
city's starving masses against the evils of contraception, urging them to "be fruitful and multiply"
and do "everything in [their] power" to resist the mortal sin of birth control.

<p>"In Genesis, God commands us to be fruitful and multiply, to fill the
Earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish and birds and every other
living thing," said Bevilacqua, speaking before more than 200,000
malnourished São Paulo slum dwellers. "It is not for man to decide whether
the world should have more babies than it can reasonably support. God will
decide whose seed shall find purchase and when."

<p>The gathering, which took place on a muddy hillside crowded with
tin-and-tarpaper shacks, was one of many to take place around the world
Monday—a day Pope John Paul II declared World Childbirth Day.
<p>"No wonder we are plagued by disease and high infant mortality,"
said São Paulo father of eight Oranjinho Cruz, speaking from his dilapidated
one-room home, which lacks electricity or potable water. "God has been
punishing us for trying to prevent the miraculous gift of conception."
<p>In Calcutta, a city where 53 percent of residents are under 18, Catholic
missionaries delivered a similar message of love and procreation.
<p>"In this life, there is a right path and a wrong path, and which you
take is entirely up to you," said missionary Christopher Halloran,
addressing a group of 4,500 villagers crammed into a schoolhouse. "Will you
deny God's wisdom by using condoms, or will you shine in the divine light of
unprotected sex? The choice is clear."
<p>"God does not want you to choke the rivers of fertile bounty with
immoral birth-control pills," continued Halloran, framed by a backdrop of
brown, withered crops and skeletal, half-living farm animals. "He wants you
to continue expanding your families. If your babies starve, Jesus will forgive
them."
<p>The words of Halloran and his fellow missionaries have struck a chord with
the impoverished masses of the world.

<p>"We were told we should not use condoms to prevent the spread of
HIV," said Luis Ortiz of Bogotá, Colombia. "The man from the Church
assured us that the Lord will protect us from disease, provided we are true to
His wish that we produce more children than we can possibly care for."
<p>Added Ortiz: "Life in this shantytown is difficult, but our troubles are
nothing compared to what we will face in the Lake Of Fire if we try to live
within our means and regulate the number of offspring we produce, as Satan teaches."
<p>Though critics have called the Catholic Church's anti-contraception campaign
irresponsible and dangerous, particularly in regions where food and medical
facilities are scarce, the missionaries remain steadfast in their commitment to
fighting the spread of birth control.
<p>"No man-made organization knows God's will," said Atlanta-born
missionary Lucas Roberts, 24, handing out Bibles to polio-stricken children in
Dhaka, Bangladesh. "His ways are mysterious and noble. All we can do is
interpret His words as they appear in the Good Book. And those words clearly
state that we have an obligation to shun effective methods of population
control."
<p>Responding to critics, Cardinal Bevilacqua said the Catholic Church is not
oblivious to the plight of the impoverished, noting that it offers a sanctioned
way to postpone the inevitable fruit of God's will.
<p>"For those who want to practice God's natural birth control, there are
two options," Bevilacqua said. "You can try abstinence or, if you are
married, you can try natural family planning, also known as the rhythm method.
This has proven up to 87 percent effective, which is more than suitable for
maintaining a reasonable household. So long as no seed is spilled, God will not
immediately strike you down."
<p>Bevilacqua also noted that, in cases in which natural family planning fails,
unwanted children can be sent to Catholic orphanages, where they will be cared
for and groomed to spread word of the punishment awaiting those who impede God's
grand biological destiny.
