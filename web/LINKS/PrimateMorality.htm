Some animals are surprisingly sensitive to the plight of
others. Chimpanzees, who cannot swim, have drowned in
zoo moats trying to save others. Given the chance to get
food by pulling a chain that would also deliver an
electric shock to a companion, rhesus monkeys will
starve themselves for several days.
<p>Biologists argue that these and other social behaviors are the
precursors of human morality. They further believe that
if morality grew out of behavioral rules shaped by
evolution, it is for biologists, not philosophers or
theologians, to say what these rules are.
<p>Moral philosophers do not take very seriously the
biologists’ bid to annex their subject, but they find
much of interest in what the biologists say and have
started an academic conversation with them.
<p>The original call to battle was sounded by the
biologist Edward O. Wilson more than 30 years ago, when
he suggested in his 1975 book “Sociobiology” that “the
time has come for ethics to be removed temporarily from
the hands of the philosophers and biologicized.” He may
have jumped the gun about the time having come, but in
the intervening decades biologists have made
considerable progress.
<p>Last year Marc Hauser, an evolutionary biologist at
Harvard, proposed in his book “Moral Minds” that the
brain has a genetically shaped mechanism for acquiring
moral rules, a universal moral grammar similar to the
neural machinery for learning language. In another
recent book, “Primates and Philosophers,” the
primatologist Frans de Waal defends against philosopher
critics his view that the roots of morality can be seen
in the social behavior of monkeys and apes.
<p>Dr. de Waal, who is director of the Living Links
Center at Emory University, argues that all social animals
have had to constrain or alter their behavior in various
ways for group living to be worthwhile. These
constraints, evident in monkeys and even more so in
chimpanzees, are part of human inheritance, too, and in
his view form the set of behaviors from which human
morality has been shaped.
<p>Many philosophers find it hard to think of animals as
moral beings, and indeed Dr. de Waal does not contend
that even chimpanzees possess morality. But he argues
that human morality would be impossible without certain
emotional building blocks that are clearly at work in
chimp and monkey societies.
<p>Dr. de Waal’s views are based on years of observing
nonhuman primates, starting with work on aggression in
the 1960s. He noticed then that after fights between two
combatants, other chimpanzees would console the loser.
But he was waylaid in battles with psychologists over
imputing emotional states to animals, and it took him 20
years to come back to the subject.
<p>He found that consolation was universal among the
great apes but generally absent from monkeys — among
macaques, mothers will not even reassure an injured
infant. To console another, Dr. de Waal argues, requires
empathy and a level of self-awareness that only apes and
humans seem to possess. And consideration of empathy
quickly led him to explore the conditions for morality.
<p>Though human morality may end in notions of rights
and justice and fine ethical distinctions, it begins,
Dr. de Waal says, in concern for others and the
understanding of social rules as to how they should be
treated. At this lower level, primatologists have shown,
there is what they consider to be a sizable overlap
between the behavior of people and other social
primates.
<p>Social living requires empathy, which is especially
evident in chimpanzees, as well as ways of bringing
internal hostilities to an end. Every species of ape and
monkey has its own protocol for reconciliation after
fights, Dr. de Waal has found. If two males fail to make
up, female chimpanzees will often bring the rivals
together, as if sensing that discord makes their
community worse off and more vulnerable to attack by
neighbors. Or they will head off a fight by taking
stones out of the males’ hands.
<p>Dr. de Waal believes that these actions are
undertaken for the greater good of the community, as
distinct from person-to-person relationships, and are a
significant precursor of morality in human societies.
<p>Macaques and chimpanzees have a sense of social order
and rules of expected behavior, mostly to do with the
hierarchical natures of their societies, in which each
member knows its own place. Young rhesus monkeys learn
quickly how to behave, and occasionally get a finger or
toe bitten off as punishment. Other primates also have a
sense of reciprocity and fairness. They remember who did
them favors and who did them wrong. Chimps are more
likely to share food with those who have groomed them.
Capuchin monkeys show their displeasure if given a
smaller reward than a partner receives for performing
the same task, like a piece of cucumber instead of a
grape.
<p>These four kinds of behavior — empathy, the ability
to learn and follow social rules, reciprocity and
peacemaking — are the basis of sociality.
<p>Dr. de Waal sees human morality as having grown out
of primate sociality, but with two extra levels of
sophistication. People enforce their society’s moral
codes much more rigorously with rewards, punishments and
reputation building. They also apply a degree of
judgment and reason, for which there are no parallels in
animals.
<p>Religion can be seen as another special ingredient of
human societies, though one that emerged thousands of
years after morality, in Dr. de Waal’s view. There are
clear precursors of morality in nonhuman primates, but
no precursors of religion. So it seems reasonable to
assume that as humans evolved away from chimps, morality
emerged first, followed by religion. “I look at
religions as recent additions,” he said. “Their function
may have to do with social life, and enforcement of
rules and giving a narrative to them, which is what
religions really do.”
<p>As Dr. de Waal sees it, human morality may be
severely limited by having evolved as a way of banding
together against adversaries, with moral restraints
being observed only toward the in group, not toward
outsiders. “The profound irony is that our noblest
achievement — morality — has evolutionary ties to our
basest behavior — warfare,” he writes. “The sense of
community required by the former was provided by the
latter.”
<p>Dr. de Waal has faced down many critics in
evolutionary biology and psychology in developing his
views. The evolutionary biologist George Williams
dismissed morality as merely an accidental byproduct of
evolution, and psychologists objected to attributing any
emotional state to animals. Dr. de Waal convinced his
colleagues over many years that the ban on inferring
emotional states was an unreasonable restriction, given
the expected evolutionary continuity between humans and
other primates.
<p>His latest audience is moral philosophers, many of
whom are interested in his work and that of other
biologists. “In departments of philosophy, an increasing
number of people are influenced by what they have to
say,” said Gilbert Harman, a Princeton University philosopher.
<p>Dr. Philip Kitcher, a philosopher at
Columbia University, likes Dr. de Waal’s empirical
approach. “I have no doubt there are patterns of
behavior we share with our primate relatives that are
relevant to our ethical decisions,” he said.
“Philosophers have always been beguiled by the dream of
a system of ethics which is complete and finished, like
mathematics. I don’t think it’s like that at all.”
<p>But human ethics are considerably more complicated
than the sympathy Dr. de Waal has described in chimps.
“Sympathy is the raw material out of which a more
complicated set of ethics may get fashioned,” he said.
“In the actual world, we are confronted with different
people who might be targets of our sympathy. And the
business of ethics is deciding who to help and why and
when.”
<p>Many philosophers believe that conscious reasoning
plays a large part in governing human ethical behavior
and are therefore unwilling to let everything proceed
from emotions, like sympathy, which may be evident in
chimpanzees. The impartial element of morality comes
from a capacity to reason, writes
<a title="More articles about Peter Singer" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/peter_singer/index.html">
Peter Singer</a>, a moral philosopher at Princeton, in
“Primates and Philosophers.” He says, “Reason is like an
escalator — once we step on it, we cannot get off until
we have gone where it takes us.”
<p>That was the view of Immanuel Kant, Dr. Singer noted,
who believed morality must be based on reason, whereas
the Scottish philosopher David Hume, followed by Dr. de
Waal, argued that moral judgments proceed from the
emotions.
<p>But biologists like Dr. de Waal believe reason is
generally brought to bear only after a moral decision
has been reached. They argue that morality evolved at a
time when people lived in small foraging societies and
often had to make instant life-or-death decisions, with
no time for conscious evaluation of moral choices. The
reasoning came afterward as a post hoc justification.
“Human behavior derives above all from fast, automated,
emotional judgments, and only secondarily from slower
conscious processes,” Dr. de Waal writes.
<p>However much we may celebrate rationality, emotions
are our compass, probably because they have been shaped
by evolution, in Dr. de Waal’s view. For example, he
says: “People object to moral solutions that involve
hands-on harm to one another. This may be because
hands-on violence has been subject to natural selection
whereas utilitarian deliberations have not.”
<p>Philosophers have another reason biologists cannot,
in their view, reach to the heart of morality, and that
is that biological analyses cannot cross the gap between
“is” and “ought,” between the description of some
behavior and the issue of why it is right or wrong. “You
can identify some value we hold, and tell an
evolutionary story about why we hold it, but there is
always that radically different question of whether we
ought to hold it,” said Sharon Street, a moral
philosopher at New York University. “That’s not to discount the
importance of what biologists are doing, but it does
show why centuries of moral philosophy are incredibly
relevant, too.”
<p>Biologists are allowed an even smaller piece of the
action by Jesse Prinz, a philosopher at the
University of North Carolina. He believes morality
developed after human evolution was finished and that
moral sentiments are shaped by culture, not
<a title="Recent and archival health news about genetics and heredity." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/geneticsandheredity/index.html">
genetics</a>. “It would be a fallacy to assume a single
true morality could be identified by what we do
instinctively, rather than by what we ought to do,” he
said. “One of the principles that might guide a single
true morality might be recognition of equal dignity for
all human beings, and that seems to be unprecedented in
the animal world.”
<p>Dr. de Waal does not accept the philosophers’ view
that biologists cannot step from “is” to “ought.” “I’m
not sure how realistic the distinction is,” he said.
“Animals do have ‘oughts.’ If a juvenile is in a fight,
the mother must get up and defend her. Or in food
sharing, animals do put pressure on each other, which is
the first kind of ‘ought’ situation.”
<p>Dr. de Waal’s definition of morality is more down to
earth than Dr. Prinz’s. Morality, he writes, is “a sense
of right and wrong that is born out of groupwide systems
of conflict management based on shared values.” The
building blocks of morality are not nice or good
behaviors but rather mental and social capacities for
constructing societies “in which shared values constrain
individual behavior through a system of approval and
disapproval.” By this definition chimpanzees in his view
do possess some of the behavioral capacities built in
our moral systems.
<p>“Morality is as firmly grounded in neurobiology as
anything else we do or are,” Dr. de Waal wrote in his
1996 book “Good Natured.” Biologists ignored this
possibility for many years, believing that because
natural selection was cruel and pitiless it could only
produce people with the same qualities. But this is a
fallacy, in Dr. de Waal’s view. Natural selection favors
organisms that survive and reproduce, by whatever means.
And it has provided people, he writes in “Primates and
Philosophers,” with “a compass for life’s choices that
takes the interests of the entire community into
account, which is the essence of human morality.”
