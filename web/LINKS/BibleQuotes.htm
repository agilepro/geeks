<a name="family"></a><br><h2>THE STORY OF JESUS' BIRTH AND FAMILY</h2>
<ol>
<li>WHEN WAS JESUS BORN? - Matthew 2:1 (NIV)<br>
After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem and asked, "Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him.".<br>
<i>[NOTES: King Herod the Great died about 4 BCE. If the Magi came from the east, they would have been going westward.]</i><p>
<li>WHEN WAS JESUS BORN? - Luke 2:1-3 (NIV)<br>
In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world. (This was the first census that took place while Quirinius/Cyrenius was governor of Syria.) And everyone went to his own town to register.<br><i>[NOTE: This census took place in 6 CE.]</i><p>
<li>WHO WAS JESUS' GRANDFATHER? - Matthew 1:16<br>
Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.<br>
<i>[NOTE: Matthew's list differs from the list of David's descendants in 1 Chronicles 3.]</i><p>
<li>WHO WAS JESUS' GRANDFATHER? - Luke 3:23-24<br>
Now Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry. He was the son, so it was thought, of Joseph, the son of Heli ...<br><i>[NOTE: Luke's list also differs from 1 Chronicles 3.]</i><p>
<li>WHO WAS JESUS' FATHER? - Matthew 1:20<br>
But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."<p>
<li>PAUL, ON WHO WAS JESUS' FATHER? - Romans 1:3 (KJV)<br>
"Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;"<p>
<li>PAUL, ON WHO WAS JESUS' FATHER? - 1 Corinthians 1:9 (NIV)<br>
"God, who has called you into fellowship with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, is faithful."<p>
<li>HOW WAS JESUS CONCEIVED? - Acts 2:30 (KJV)<br>
Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him [King David], that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;<p>
<li>PAUL, ON WHO WAS JESUS' ANCESTOR? - Galatians 3:16 (NIV)<br>
"The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed."<br><i>[NOTE: Paul did not say "to his seeds," meaning many people, but "to his seed," meaning one person, Christ. Galatians 3:16, Acts 2:30 and Romans 1:3 negate the virgin birth idea.]</i><p>
<a name="born"></a>
<li>WHERE WAS JESUS BORN? HOW WAS JESUS CONCEIVED? - Matthew 1:18-25<br>
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit. Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly. But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins." All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: "The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel" — which means, "God with us." When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife. But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.<br>
<i>NOTES:<ul>
<li>The supposed prophesy, in <a href="#isaiah_7_14">Isaiah 7:14</a>, was for its time, not for Jesus (about 700 years in the future).
<li>Isaiah 7:14 referred to a young woman ('almah'), not a virgin ('betulot').
<li>2 Chronicles 28 shows that King Ahaz (who received the prophesy from Isaiah) was later defeated — negating Isaiah's prophesy.
<li>Matthew has Jesus born in the Bethlehem home of Joseph, where the family stayed for about two years.
<li>They never called Jesus "Immanuel" in the Bible.
</ul></i><p>
<li>WHERE WAS JESUS BORN? - Luke 2:4-7 (NIV)<br>
So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David. He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child. While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born, and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son.<br>
<i>[NOTE: Luke has Jesus born in a stable, the traditional location. The family went to Jerusalem about eight days later, then returned to Nazareth. There were no Maji.]</i><p>
</ol><hr>
<a name="theft"></a><br><h2>JESUS ON THEFT</h2>
<ol>
<li>JESUS ON THEFT, AND WORKING ON THE SABBATH - Matthew 12:1 (NIV)<br>
At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them.<p>
<li>JESUS ON THEFT - Matthew 21:2<br>
"Go to the village ahead of you, and at once you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me."<p>
<li>JESUS ON THEFT - Mark 11:2 <i>[same as Luke 19:30]</i><br>
"Go to the village ahead of you, and just as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here."<p>
</ol>
<hr>
<a name="prophesy"></a><br><h2>DID JESUS FULFILL PROPHESY?</h2>
<i>NOTES:<br>
Since the story of Jesus is fictional, when the gospels were written after about 70 CE (see Mark 13:2, below), prophesy could be “fulfilled” by just adding it to the story — and they still couldn't always get it right.<p>
There is no evidence of a town of Nazareth in Galilee existing in the first half of the first century, even tho it's mentioned dozens of times in the New Testament. The unknown author of Matthew got "Nazarene" (a person from Nazareth) confused with "Nazirite" (one who lives apart and has made a vow of abstinence).<p>
Jesus was said to have been born in Bethlehem to (incorrectly) fulfill Micah 5:2; Jesus was from Nazareth to (incorrectly) fulfill Judges 13:5; his family had to go to Egypt to (incorrectly) fulfill Hosea 11:1; and he rode two animals at once to (incorrectly) fulfill Zechariah 9:9.</i><p>
<ol>
<li>“TRUE” PROPHESY - Mark 13:2<br>
"Do you see all these great buildings?" replied Jesus. "Not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."<br><i>[NOTE: This probably refers to the destruction of Jerusalem, in 70 CE. Most scholars think that it was written after the fact.]</i><p>
<li>THE PROPHESIED COMING OF ISRAEL'S RULER - Micah 5:2 (NIV)<br>
But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times.<p>
<li>WHERE WAS JESUS BORN? - Matthew 2:1 (NIV)<br>
After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, ...<br><i>[NOTE: Jesus was never ruler over Israel.]</i><p>
<li>THE PROPHESIED COMING OF ZION'S KING - Zechariah 9:9 (NIV)<br>
Rejoice greatly, O Daughter of Zion! Shout, Daughter of Jerusalem! See, your king comes to you, righteous and having salvation, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.<br><i>[NOTE: This actually meant one animal.]</i><p>
<li>JESUS RIDES TWO ANIMALS AT ONCE! - Matthew 21:7<br>
They brought the donkey and the colt, placed their cloaks on them, and Jesus sat on them.<br>
<i>[NOTE: This impossible story resulted from a mistranslation of Zechariah 9:9.]</i><p>
<a name="naz"></a><li>THE PROPHESIED NAZIRITE - Judges 13:5 (NIV)<br>
" ... because you will conceive and give birth to a son. No razor may be used on his head, because the boy is to be a Nazirite, set apart to God from birth, and he will begin the deliverance of Israel from the hands of the Philistines."<br><i>[NOTE: This actually referred to Samson, not Jesus (about 1100 years later).]</i><p>
<li>NAZARETH, NAZARENE, NAZIRITE CONFUSED - Matthew 2:23 (NIV)<br>
... and [Joseph] went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets: "He will be called a Nazarene."<br><i>[NOTE: There is no mention of Nazareth or Nazarene in the Old Testament, just Nazirite in Judges 13:5.]</i><p>
<li>ISRAEL (JESUS?) IN EGYPT - Hosea 11:1 (NIV)<br>
"When Israel was a child, I [God] loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son."<br><i>[NOTE: This denotes a past event, not one over 700 years later. It likely referred to the purported exodus of the Jews from Egypt.]</i><p>
<li>JESUS IN EGYPT - Matthew 2:13-15 (NIV)<br>
When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. "Get up," he said, "take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him." So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt, where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: "Out of Egypt I called my son."<p>
<li>JESUS <b>NOT</b> IN EGYPT - Luke 2:39 (NIV)<br>
When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth.<p>
<li>PROPHESY OF HEROD'S “SLAUGHTER OF THE INNOCENTS” - Jeremiah 31:15 (NIV)<br>
This is what the LORD says: "A voice is heard in Ramah, mourning and great weeping, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because her children are no more."<br>
<i>[NOTE: Matthew 2:18 refers to this, but Ramah was on the other side of Jerusalem from Bethlehem. Also, a 600 year-old tale of one woman weeping for her children hardly conveys the magnitude of the supposed slaughter.]</i><p>
<a name="slaughter"></a>
<li>HEROD'S “SLAUGHTER OF THE INNOCENTS” - Matthew 2:16 (NIV)<br>
When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under<br><i>[NOTE: This is not mentioned by any historian of the time, or in any other gospel. However, it fulfilled a common story line for religious saviors.]</i><p>
<li>CRUCIFICTION FORETOLD? - Psalm 22:16 (NIV)<br>
Dogs have surrounded me; a band of evil men has encircled me, they have pierced my hands and my feet.<p>
<li>JUDAS' PAYMENT FORETOLD? - Zechariah 11:12<br>
I told them, "If you think it best, give me my pay; but if not, keep it." So they paid me thirty pieces of silver.<br>
<i>[NOTE: It's easy to “fulfill prophesy” if a story is written to do just that.]</i><p>
</ol><hr>
<a name="predicts"></a><br><h2>FALSE PROPHESY AND FALSE PROPHETS</h2>
<i>NOTE: If Jesus had actually told his disciples that he would resurrect after the crucifixion, why were they so upset when he was arrested, and dubious when he supposedly really did come back?</i><p>
<ol>
<a name="isaiah_7_14"></a><li>FALSE PROPHESY - Isaiah 7:14 (NIV)<br>
Therefore the Lord himself will give you [King Ahaz] a sign: The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel.<br><i>[NOTE: The original word ('almah') in Hebrew meant maiden, not virgin ('betulot'). Also, the context shows that this was meant for its time, not about 700 years later.]</i><p>
<li>FALSE PROPHESY - 2 Chronicles 28:5 (NIV)<br>
Therefore the LORD his God handed [King Ahaz] over to the king of Aram. The Arameans defeated [King Ahaz] and took many of his people as prisoners and brought them to Damascus.<br><i>[NOTE: This shows that the sign of the prophesy in Isaiah 7:14 (above) failed even in its time.]</i><p>
<li>FALSE PROPHESY - Matthew 1:23<br>
The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel — which means, "God with us."<br><i>[NOTE: They never called Jesus "Immanuel." The author of Matthew was really reaching when he created this “prophesy” from Isaiah 7:14.]</i><p>
<li>FALSE PROPHESY: JESUS PREDICTS HIS RETURN - Matthew 10:23 <i>[We're still waiting.]</i><br>
"I tell you the truth, you will not finish going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes."<p>
<li>FALSE PROPHESY: JESUS PREDICTS HIS CHURCH WILL LAST - Matthew 16:18 (NIV)<br>
And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. <i>[There've been many "true churches" that have come and gone.]</i><p>
<li>FALSE PROPHESY: JESUS PREDICTS HIS RETURN - Matthew 16:28 <i>[We're still waiting.]</i><br>
"I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."<p>
<li>FALSE PROPHESY: JESUS PREDICTS HIS RETURN - Matthew 24:34 (same as Mark 13:30) <i>[We're still waiting.]</i><br>
"I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened."<p>
<li>FALSE PROPHESY: JESUS PREDICTS KINGDOM OF GOD - Mark 9:1 (NIV) <i>[We're still waiting.]</i><br>
And [Jesus] said to them, "Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see that the kingdom of God has come with power."<p>
<li>FALSE PROPHESY: JESUS PREDICTS KINGDOM OF GOD - Luke 9:27 (NIV)<br>
"Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God."<p>
<li>TRUE PROPHESY: JESUS PREDICTS NO MIRACULOUS SIGN - Mark 8:12 (NIV)<br>
[Jesus] sighed deeply and said, "Why does this generation ask for a miraculous sign? I tell you the truth, no sign will be given to it."<p>
<li>FALSE PROPHESY: JESUS PREDICTS A MIRACULOUS SIGN - Matthew 12:39-40 (NIV)<br>
[Jesus] answered, "A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth."<p>
<li>FALSE PROPHESY: JESUS PREDICTS A MIRACULOUS SIGN - Matthew 16:4 (NIV)<br>
"A wicked and adulterous generation looks for a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah."<p>
<li>FALSE PROPHESY: JESUS PREDICTS A MIRACULOUS SIGN - Luke 11:29-30 (NIV)<br>
As the crowds increased, Jesus said, "This is a wicked generation. It asks for a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah. For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be to this generation."<p>
<li>FALSE PROPHESY: JESUS PREDICTS THREE DAYS IN THE TOMB - Mark 8:31<br>
[Jesus] then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and after three days rise again.<p>
<li>FALSE PROPHESY: JESUS PREDICTS THREE DAYS IN THE TOMB - Mark 9:31<br>
He said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise."<p>
<li>FALSE PROPHESY: JESUS PREDICTS THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS IN THE TOMB - Matthew 12:40 <i>[Not a day and a half!]</i><br>
"For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth."<p>
<li>FALSE PROPHESY: JESUS PREDICTS KINGDOM OF GOD - Mark 9:1 <i>[We're still waiting.]</i><br>
And [Jesus] said to them, "I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God come with power."<p>
<li>FALSE PROPHESY: JESUS PREDICTS THE END OF THE WORLD - Luke 21:25-33 (NLT) <i>[We're still waiting.]</i><br>
"And there will be strange events in the skies – signs in the sun, moon, and stars. And down here on earth the nations will be in turmoil, perplexed by the roaring seas and strange tides. The courage of many people will falter because of the fearful fate they see coming upon the earth, because the stability of the very heavens will be broken up. Then everyone will see the Son of Man arrive on the clouds with power and great glory. So when all these things begin to happen, stand straight and look up, for your salvation is near! Then he gave them this illustration: "Notice the fig tree, or any other tree. When the leaves come out, you know without being told that summer is near. Just so, when you see the events I've described taking place, you can be sure that the Kingdom of God is near. I assure you, this generation will not pass from the scene until all these events have taken place. Heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will remain forever"<p>
<li>FALSE PROPHESY: PAUL PREDICTS JESUS' RETURN - Hebrews 10:37<br> 
"For in just a very little while, He who is coming will come and will not delay."<p>
<li>FALSE PROPHESY: PAUL PREDICTS JESUS' RETURN - Thessalonians 4:15-17 (NIV)<br> 
"According to the Lord’s word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever."<p>
<li>FALSE PROPHESY - John 3:13 (KJV) <i>[See 2 Kings 2:11, next.]</i><br>
"And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven."<p>
<li>ELIJAH WENT TO HEAVEN - 2 Kings 2:11 (KJV)<br>
And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.<p>
</ol><hr>
<a name="failed"></a><br><h2>FAILED PROPHESY</h2>
<ol>
<li>FAILED PROPHESY - Genesis 6:7 (NIV)<br>
So the Lord said, "I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created — and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground — for I regret that I have made them."<br><i>[NOTE: How can an omnipotent, omniscient being have regret?]</i><p>
<li>FAILED PROPHESY - 2 Chronicles 7:18<br>
[God] said, "You shall never fail to have a man to rule over Israel."<p>
<li>FAILED PROPHESY - Ezekiel 16:53<br>
"However, I will restore the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters and of Samaria and her daughters, and your fortunes along with them."<p>
<li>FAILED PROPHESY/PRAYER - John 17:20-23 (i.e. Jesus' Most Unanswered Prayer)<br>
"I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you…that they may be one as we are one —
I in them and you in me — so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that you sent me."<p>

<li>GOD PERFORMS A PARTY TRICK - Exodus 4:6,7 (NIV)<br>
Then the Lord said, “Put your hand inside your cloak.” So Moses put his hand into his cloak, and when he took it out, the skin was leprous—it had become as white as snow. “Now put it back into your cloak,” he said.

<li>AN ANGEL PERFORMS A PARTY TRICK - Judges 6:20,21 (NIV)<br>
The angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and the unleavened bread, place them on this rock, and pour out the broth.” And Gideon did so.

<li>GOD PERFORMS A PARTY TRICK - Judges 6:36-38 (NIV)<br>
Gideon said to God, “If you will save Israel by my hand as you have promised—look, I will place a wool fleece on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece and all the ground is dry, then I will know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you said.” And that is what happened. Gideon rose early the next day; he squeezed the fleece and wrung out the dew—a bowlful of water.<p>
<li>GOD PERFORMS A PARTY TRICK - Judges 6:39,40 (NIV)<br>
Then Gideon said to God, “Do not be angry with me. Let me make just one more request. Allow me one more test with the fleece, but this time make the fleece dry and let the ground be covered with dew.” That night God did so. Only the fleece was dry; all the ground was covered with dew.<p>
<li>GOD PERFORMS A PARTY TRICK - 1 Kings 18:36-38 (NIV)<br>
At the time of sacrifice, the prophet Elijah stepped forward and prayed: “Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, let it be known today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and have done all these things at your command. Answer me, Lord, answer me, so these people will know that you, Lord, are God, and that you are turning their hearts back again.” Then the fire of the Lord fell and burned up the sacrifice, the wood, the stones and the soil, and also licked up the water in the trench.<p>
<li>GOD PERFORMS A PARTY TRICK (by making a star in the east) - Matthew 2:1 (NIV)<br>

Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each holding from twenty to thirty gallons.

And another of his disciples said unto him, "Suffer me first to go and bury my father." But Jesus said unto him, "Follow me and let the dead bury their dead."<p>

"For I have come to turn a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law — a man's enemies will be the members of his own household.

"I have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled! But I have a baptism to undergo, and how distressed I am until it is completed! Do you think I came to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but division. From now on there will be five in one family divided against each other, three against two and two against three.

<li>JESUS ON FAMILY VALUES - Luke 14:26 <i>[What about John 3:15 and 4:19-21 (below)?]</i><br>
"If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters — yes, even his own life — he cannot be my disciple."<br>
<i>[NOTE: Buybull thumpers often say that this doesn't really mean “hate,” it just means “love less.” Some translations even word it like that (e.g. Contemporary English Version), because they don't like that nasty word “hate.” The original Greek word “miseo” always means hate; it has no alternative meaning. The prefixes for misanthropy and misogyny come from miseo. This just shows how screwed-up their minds are. If hate equals a form of love, how can we trust anything that those translations say?]</i><p>

Many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist.<p>

Then it happened that as Jesus was reclining at the table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and were dining with Jesus and His disciples. When the Pharisees saw this, they said to His disciples, "Why is your Teacher eating with the tax collectors and sinners?" But when Jesus heard this, He said, "It is not those who are healthy who need a physician, but those who are sick.

"I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ."<br>
<i>[NOTE: It can easily be argued that this means that Paul made it up, or derived his ideas from Jewish scripture and other religions.]</i><p>

"Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children and live a life of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God."<br>

"For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Peter, and then to the Twelve. After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born."<br>
<i>[NOTE: This is obviously just from Paul's hyperactive imagination, coupled with reading the Scriptures.]</i><p>
<li>PAUL ON THE RESURRECTION - 1 Corinthians 15:13-19 (NIV)<br>
"If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith. More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised. For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either. And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins. Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost. If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are to be pitied more than all men."<br>

If his master gave him a wife while he was a slave, and they had sons or daughters, then the man will be free in the seventh year, but his wife and children will still belong to his master. But the slave may plainly declare, 'I love my master, my wife, and my children. I would rather not go free.' If he does this, his master must present him before God. Then his master must take him to the door and publicly pierce his ear with an awl. After that, the slave will belong to his master forever."<p>
<li>SLAVERY & POLYGAMY - Exodus 21:7-11 (NLT)<br>
When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she will not be freed at the end of six years as the men are. If she does not please the man who bought her, he may allow her to be bought back again. But he is not allowed to sell her to foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her. And if the slave girl's owner arranges for her to marry his son, he may no longer treat her as a slave girl, but he must treat her as his daughter. If he himself marries her and then takes another wife, he may not reduce her food or clothing or fail to sleep with her as his wife. If he fails in any of these three ways, she may leave as a free woman without making any payment.<p>
<li>SLAVERY - Exodus 21:20-21<br>

Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites and the Amalekites. (From ancient times these peoples had lived in the land extending to Shur and Egypt.) Whenever David attacked an area, he did not leave a man or woman alive, but took sheep and cattle, donkeys and camels, and clothes. Then he returned to Achish.<br>When Achish asked, "Where did you go raiding today?" David would say, "Against the Negev of Judah" or "Against the Negev of Jerahmeel" or "Against the Negev of the Kenites." He did not leave a man or woman alive to be brought to Gath, for he thought, "They might inform on us and say, 'This is what David did.'" And such was his practice as long as he lived in Philistine territory. Achish trusted David and said to himself, "He has become so obnoxious to his people, the Israelites, that he will be my servant for life."<br><i>[NOTE: Apparently God didn't mind, because 1 Kings 15:5 says, "For David had done what was right in the eyes of the LORD and had not failed to keep any of the LORD’s commands all the days of his life, except in the case of Uriah the Hittite."]</i><p>

But first give the LORD his share of the captives, cattle, donkeys, sheep, and goats that belong to the army. Set apart one out of every five hundred as the LORD's share. Give this share of their half to Eleazar the priest as an offering to the LORD. Also take one of every fifty of the captives, cattle, donkeys, sheep, and goats in the half that belongs to the people of Israel.

A jealous and avenging God is the LORD. The LORD is avenging and wrathful. The LORD takes vengeance on His adversaries, and He reserves wrath for His enemies. The LORD is slow to anger and great in power, and the LORD will by no means leave the guilty unpunished. In whirlwind and storm is His way, and clouds are the dust beneath His feet. He rebukes the sea and makes it dry. He dries up all the rivers. Bashan and Carmel wither. The blossoms of Lebanon wither. Mountains quake because of Him, and the hills dissolve. Indeed the earth is upheaved by His presence, the world and all the inhabitants in it. Who can stand before His indignation? Who can endure the burning of His anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken up by Him. The LORD is good.<p>

As Goliath moved closer to attack, David quickly ran out to meet him. Reaching into his shepherd’s bag and taking out a stone, he hurled it with his sling and hit the Philistine in the forehead.

<li>WHO KILLED GOLIATH? - 2 Samuel 21:19 (DARBY)<br>
And there was again a battle at Gob with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, a Bethlehemite, smote Goliath the Gittite; now the shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam.<p>
<li>WHO KILLED GOLIATH? - 2 Samuel 21:19 (NLT)<br>

<li>MENSTRUATION - Leviticus 15:19-30 (NIV)<br>
When a woman has her regular flow of blood, the impurity of her monthly period will last seven days, and anyone who touches her will be unclean till evening.

Whoever touches her bed must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean till evening. Whoever touches anything she sits on must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean till evening. Whether it is the bed or anything she was sitting on, when anyone touches it, he will be unclean till evening. If a man lies with her and her monthly flow touches him, he will be unclean for seven days; any bed he lies on will be unclean. When a woman has a discharge of blood for many days at a time other than her monthly period or has a discharge that continues beyond her period, she will be unclean as long as she has the discharge, just as in the days of her period. Any bed she lies on while her discharge continues will be unclean, as is her bed during her monthly period, and anything she sits on will be unclean, as during her period. Whoever touches them will be unclean; he must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean till evening. When she is cleansed from her discharge, she must count off seven days, and after that she will be ceremonially clean. On the eighth day she must take two doves or two young pigeons and bring them to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. The priest is to sacrifice one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. In this way he will make atonement for her before the LORD for the uncleanness of her discharge.<p>

<li>GOD, GOVERNMENT AND TAXES - Romans 13:1-7 <i>[No American Revolution? Republicans must obey a Democratic President?]</i><br>
Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and he will commend you. For he is God's servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience. This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God's servants, who give their full time to governing. Give everyone what you owe him: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.<p>
<li>GOD AND THE LAW - 1 Timothy 1:8-10 (CEV) <i>(likely a forgery)</i><br>

The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening, and there was morning — the third day.<p>
<li>GOD FINALLY CREATED THE SUN AND MOON ON THE FOURTH DAY - Genesis 1:14-19<br>
And God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark seasons and days and years, and let them be lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth." And it was so. God made two great lights — the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth, to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening, and there was morning — the fourth day.<p>
<li>GOD CREATED ANIMALS ON THE FIFTH DAY - Genesis 1:20-23<br>
And God said, "Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky." So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. God blessed them and said, "Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth." And there was evening, and there was morning — the fifth day.<p>
<li>GOD(s) CREATED MAN AND WOMAN ON THE SIXTH DAY, AFTER THE ANIMALS - Genesis 1:24-27 <i>[See Genesis 2:4-8, below]</i><br>
And God said, "Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each according to its kind." And it was so. God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. Then God said, "Let <b><i>us</b></i> make man in <b><i>our</b></i> image, in <b><i>our</b></i> likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground." So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.<p>
<li>GOD SAID ALL SEED-BEARING PLANTS ARE EDIBLE - Genesis 1:29<br>
Then God said, "I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food."<p>
<li>GOD SAID ALL ANIMALS ARE HERBIVORES - Genesis 1:30<br>
"And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the ground — everything that has the breath of life in it — I give every green plant for food."<p>
<li>END OF THE SIXTH DAY - Genesis 1:31<br>
God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day.<p>

<ol>
<li>GOD CREATED MAN, THEN PLANTS AND ANIMALS - Genesis 2:4-8 <i>[See Genesis 1:24-31, above]</i><br>
This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created. When the LORD God made the earth and the heavens — and no shrub of the field had yet appeared on the earth and no plant of the field had yet sprung up, for the LORD God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no man to work the ground, but streams came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground — the LORD God formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being. Now the LORD God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden;<p>
<li>GOD CREATED THE ANIMALS - Genesis 2:19<br>
Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air.<p>

Cain said to the LORD, "My punishment is more than I can bear. Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me." But the LORD said to him, "Not so; if anyone kills Cain, he will suffer vengeance seven times over." Then the LORD put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him. So Cain went out from the LORD's presence and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden. Cain lay with his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch.<p>

And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.<p>
<li>WHAT HAPPENED TO ADAM AND EVE - Genesis 3:22<br>
And the LORD God said, "The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever."<p>
<li>ADAM DID NOT DIE THE DAY HE ATE THE FRUIT - Genesis 5:5 (KJV)<br>
And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.<p>

<li>10. SLAUGHTER EVERYONE, BUT KEEP THE VIRGINS AS WAR BOOTY - Num 31:7–40 (NIV)<br>
They fought against Midian, as the Lord commanded Moses, and killed every man... The Israelites captured the Midianite women and children and took all the Midianite herds, flocks and goods as plunder... Moses was angry with the officers... “Have you allowed all the women to live?” he asked them... “Now kill all the boys. And kill every woman who has slept with a man, but save for yourselves every girl who has never slept with a man.”... So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the Lord commanded Moses. The plunder remaining from the spoils that the soldiers took was 675,000 sheep, 72,000 cattle, 61,000 donkeys and 32,000 women who had never slept with a man. The half share of those who fought in the battle was... 16,000 people, of whom the tribute for the Lord was 32.<p>

The Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man who fears God and turns away from evil. He still persists in his integrity, although you incited me against him, to destroy him for no reason.”<p>
<li>8. GOD KILLS THE FETUSES OF THOSE WHO DO NOT WORSHIP HIM - Hosea 13:4, 9, 16 (NIV)<br>

And in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking a place of their own where they might settle, because they had not yet come into an inheritance among the tribes of Israel... Then they said to [the priest], “Please inquire of God to learn whether our journey will be successful.” The priest answered them, “Go in peace. Your journey has the Lord’s approval.”... Then they took what Micah had made, and his priest, and went on to Laish, against a people at peace and secure. They attacked them with the sword and burned down their city... The Danites rebuilt the city and settled there.<p>
<li>6. BABIES SLAUGHTERED AND WIVES RAPED - Isaiah 13:9–16 (NIV)<br>

When Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah, who should come out to meet him but his daughter, dancing to the sound of timbrels!... After the two months, she returned to her father, and he did to her as he had vowed.<p>
<li>3. GOD MAKES PEOPLE EAT HUMAN FLESH - Leviticus 26:27–29 (KJV)<br>
And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me; Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins. And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.<p>
<li>2. GOD THREATENS RAPE, THEN TAKES CREDIT FOR IT - Jeremiah 13:15–26 (NRSV)<br>
Hear and give ear; do not be haughty, for the Lord has spoken... And if you say in your heart, “Why have these things come upon me?” it is for the greatness of your iniquity that your skirts are lifted up, and you are violated... because you have forgotten me and trusted in lies. I myself will lift up your skirts over your face, and your shame will be seen.<p>
