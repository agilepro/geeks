<p>NEWS FROM MILLENNIUM PRESS<p>

Pagan, myth or history? A comprehensive examination of the
vast difference between what the Bible meant to the people who wrote it, and
how it is understood today.

<h1><u>The Secret Origins of the Bible</u></h1>
<p>By Tim Callahan<br>
Publication Date: September 23, 2002<br>
ISBN: 0-9655047-8-6<br>
$29.95 (U.S.) $37.95 (Canada) Cloth<br>
468 pages; 120 illustrations<p>
It is surprising that a book as widely explained as the
Bible can still hold secrets. Many intelligent and otherwise well informed readers
will find much of the material in this book new and quite startling, although
Bible scholars, and anyone who has even an amateur background in comparative
mythology, will be familiar with it.

<p>Bible scholar and religion editor Tim Callahan fills the gap
left by many Bible interpreters who examine only those Bible verses which can
be made to support their personal or political views. But the world needs a
broader understanding of its sacred texts, particularly when selective
interpretation of the Bible is used to fuel extremism, and when interpreting
Bible verses out of the context in which they were written intrudes on rational
solutions for modern problems.
<p>Callahan uses comparative mythology to demonstrate how Bible
stories that do not make much sense on the surface can be understood on deeper
levels when their mythic content is revealed. He uses literary analysis,
history, and archeological comparisons to expand our understanding of the
purpose these stories served for those who originally wrote them.<p>

Callahan subjects biblical narratives to each the following questions:<p>

1) Is the narrative literally true based on history, archaeology and science?<br>
2) Are there internal inconsistencies, anachronisms, or
other clues that invalidate the narrative if it is to be considered historical or to be taken literally?<br>
3) Is the reasoning behind the narrative and the ethical beliefs derived from it based on a world view foreign to our own sense of ethics?<br>
4) Is there a mythic meaning to the narrative that is quite different from what a literal interpretation of the narrative might imply?<br>
5) What social or political stance do believers derive from
the biblical narrative, and how valid is their use of the Bible to back up
their personal and political positions?

<p>Secret Origins Of the Bible covers many issues from both the
familiar and the more obscure chapters of the Bible:<ul>
<li>Is there historical evidence for the Exodus or Joshua's conquest of Canaan?
<li>What contributions did the mythology of ancient Egypt and other surrounding cultures make to modern Christianity?
<li>How did the religion of ancient Israel, before the Exile, differ from today's ethics-based monotheism? Bible stories are examined that suggest that along with Yahweh, the Israelites worshiped and acknowledged other
deities, such as Chemosh and Azazel, and that their primitive polytheistic religion included worship of a goddess who was the consort of Yahweh, some form of tree worship, ecstatic trances, fortune telling, human sacrifice, a cult of the dead, and solar worship.
<li>Why is so much material in the Bible repetitive and even contradictory?
<li>How linguistic analysis of Biblical names reveals their original hidden meanings.
<li>How were tales from rival sources altered toward more masculine outlook?
<li>What do anachronisms and other incompatibilities in both time and culture reveal about the historicity of the stories of the biblical patriarchs?
<li>What is the evidence that the biblical stories of the creation, the race of giants, the flood, and the tower of Babel were independently derived from earlier tales told by the Sumerians and pre-Israelite Semitic peoples?
<li>What ancient mythic themes influenced the Nativity, Passion, and Resurrection narratives of the Christian Bible?
<li>How did a new idea — the concept of a perfect God — inspire the idea of the perfect word of God which led to belief in biblical inerrancy?
</ul><p>Callahan admires the great biblical mythic themes and warns
that those who are not sympathetic to religion and trivialize the Bible will fail
to understand the power these myths have on people. Callahan respects the
mythic material and points out that such myths endure, at least in part,
because they resonate with deep psychological needs and have a validity beyond
that of literal truth.

<h2>PRAISE FOR "THE SECRET ORIGINS OF THE BIBLE"</h2>
<p>"Tim Callahan here blends his remarkably diverse
knowledge of ancient history, archaeology, linguistics, mythology, numismatics
and of course the Bible itself to examine scriptural 'truths' long held inviolate
by religious fundamentalists. Secret Origins of the Bible is a must-read for
anyone wishing to understand more completely what the Bible is really
saying — and not saying — to us all."<br>
--Dr. Clayton J. Drees, Associate Professor of History, Virginia Wesleyan College

<p>"There is a vast disconnect between the public's belief
that the Bible is a divinely-produced original work of religious literature,
and the scholar's knowledge that all of the major stories in the Bible have
historical antecedents and can be traced to very non-divinely produced works by
other cultures in earlier times. The Bible may contain "the greatest story
ever told," but as Tim Callahan so brilliantly reveals the greatest secret
of all is that the story is not original. This book is sure to shake
fundamentalist beliefs about the Bible to the core."
<br>--Dr. Michael Shermer, author of How We Believe, Contributing Editor, Scientific American

<h2>Why I wrote this book</h2>
by Tim Callahan<p>

When this book was begun the world was still mourning the
death of Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin at the hands of an assassin who
felt himself to be an instrument of divine wrath. The book goes to press as the
world reels from the shock of the World Trade Center attacks by religious
zealots who believed they would be rewarded in heaven for carrying out God's will.

<p>The world needs a broader understanding of the background of
the mythology that makes up sacred texts. It is often the case that
fundamentalists, while maintaining that all of the Bible is true, interpret it
in an exclusionary manner favoring their own political views. Dispensing with
the myth might make it possible for an Israeli state and a Palestinian Arab
state to share the land.

<p>Israel is not the only place or political arena in which fundamentalists
have used biblical myths to intrude on the rational solution of modern
problems. Here in America they would replace biology with creationism, base
sexual morals on Levitical law, have us believe we are all inherently evil and
guilty of a sin we did not commit, and tie us in psychological knots with
doctrines such as the supposed compatibility of free will and predestination.
In the face of potential environmental catastrophe and the imminent extinction
of vast numbers of plant and animal species, they claim environmental action is
unnecessary because God told them to "subdue [the earth] — and have
dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every
living thing that moveth upon the earth." Forced to confront brutal dictatorships,
the exploitation of immigrant laborers, and the inequality of the sexes, they
cite Paul and Peter saying that all governments are instituted by God, telling
slaves to obey their masters, and women to submit to their husbands.
Everywhere, myth is used as a prop to maintain injustice in the name of God. Is
this really that far removed from the acts of assassins murdering in the name
of all that is holy?

<p>This book limits itself to those myths which directly
influence the American culture — and these are chiefly from the Bible. It is the
purpose of this book to examine the biblical stories, and their origins, upon
which is based a modern mythology that still drives people at the beginning of
the twenty-first century, in the face of often desperate problems, to cherish
myths over reason.

<p>Are these stories true? And if they are, when were they written?

<p>How are we to know if a story in the Bible is historically
true? Can these tales be either verified or falsified? And if they can, by what
means? Secret Origins Of the Bible answers these questions with specific
examples.

<p>To test the historical validity of biblical narratives then,
we must compare each of them with historical and archaeological records, and
check the language of the verses for signs of anachronisms. I deliberately
choose narratives that can be corroborated by history and archaeology to
demonstrate the neutrality of these two disciplines. While the believer may
rejoice in the corroboration of 2 Kings 24 and 25, there is no historical support
for certain other famous biblical stories, such as the Exodus. Likewise every
attempt to validate Joshua's conquest of Canaan is frustrated by the
archaeological record. It is, in fact, doubtful that any of the conquest
narrative related in Joshua is true.

<p>The dating of these stories is important. If we find that a
story purporting to relate events in the life of Abraham contains gross
anachronisms in it, such as referring to the city of his father as "Ur of
the Chaldees," or saying that Abraham lived in the "land of the
Philistines" (Gen. 21:34) — people who did not come to Canaan until several
centuries later — we know that the story was written down hundreds of years after
the events were purported to have taken place. This means that the
"Chistory" being related may well have been tailored to the time of
its writing. In certain cases supposed prophecies can be shown by examination
of these anachronisms to have been written after the events they were
supposedly predicting.

<p>Anachronisms are not the only internal clues which reflect
on the historical validity of a given biblical narrative. The literary forms
used that indicate changes in authorship in a work attributed to one man, as in
Isaiah, and the use of words or even a language from a later period, as in the
Aramaic laced with Greek words in parts of Daniel, are other clues. So too are
internal inconsistencies in the Bible, such as where there are two or more
accounts of how something happened within the same book. The two creation
stories of Genesis 1 and 2 are an obvious example.&nbsp; Both the historical validity
and the supposed divine inspiration
of the Bible are called into doubt when one book contradicts another. Many
Bible stories have two or even three different versions which all contradict
each other.&nbsp; They cannot all be right.

<p>Even if a biblical narrative is deemed historically true,
can we base our ethics on such narratives and their moral injunctions?

<p>Fundamentalists frequently use the codes of sexual ethics from
Leviticus and Deuteronomy as a club with which to beat others. Since these
codes include prohibitions against adultery (Lev. 18:20, 20:10; Deut. 22:22),
incest (Lev. 18:6-18, 20:11, 12, 14, 17, 19-21; Deut. 22:30), rape (Deut.
22:25), prostitution (Deut. 23:17), and bestiality (Lev. 18:23, 20:15, 16), the
codes seem to relate to acts universally condemned by all societies, which
gives them a certain validity. Of course, the main prohibition stressed by
fundamentalists is that against homosexuality (Lev. 18:22, 20:13). Assuming
that the penalties are moderated a bit — most of these offenses carried the
death penalty — many people might be swayed by their seeming reasonableness.

<p>However, this same code also prohibits a couple from having
sex during the wife's menstrual period, with the penalty that the offenders
will be "cut off from among their people." The Hebrew word word
translated as "cut off" is karath, which also means to destroy. That
the Levitical sexual prohibitions were based on a psychology far different from
our own can be seen not only in the exaggerated fear of menstrual blood, but in
a verse just preceding the list of penalties for sexual offenses. Leviticus
20:9 says: "For every one who curses his father or his mother shall be put
to death; he has cursed his father or his mother, his blood is upon him."
Are we to read this to mean that if, in a fit of rage, your teenage son or
daughter yells, "God damn you!" it's curtains for them? To understand
the harshness of this penalty we must remember that in ancient times words were
thought to have power. To curse someone was to literally call down a
supernatural force on the cursed, hence the injunction in the Ten Commandments
not to take the Lord's name in vain. Cursing one's parents was tantamount to
physically assaulting them. It was also thought that such curses could likely
result in the victim's death unless that person had a protective counter charm.
That the prohibition against swearing is based on magical thinking has not
blunted its force among some believers.

<p>However, fundamentalists are adamant that we cannot pick and
choose which biblical prohibitions we will and will not obey. We cannot, for
example, say that rape, adultery, incest, prostitution, and bestiality are
wrong and should be made illegal, then turn and say that premarital sex and
homosexuality are private matters which should be legal. Yet, if their
reasoning is that such acts are condemned by God based on the Levitical and
Deuteronomic codes, then they too are prohibited from picking and choosing, and
they must, according to their own doctrine, give equal weight to the
prohibitions against various other sexual behaviors and those against wearing
linen and wool together. Fundamentalists are as selective as the rest of us in
even what New Testament teachings they follow. Specifically, Jesus was quite
plain both in prohibiting divorce except in cases of adultery (Mk. 10:11,12;
Lk. 16:18; Mt. 5:31.32) and in his condemnation of wealth and the accumulation
of material goods. Yet the divorce rate does not vary greatly between seculars
and evengelicals, and fundamentalists are among the most avid of capitalists.
