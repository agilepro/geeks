<h2><u>The Ten Commandments - Two of the Three Sets, & other Bible Quotes</u></h2>
<h3>Exodus 20:2-17, The Ten Commandments. God punishes to the 3rd and 4th generation.</h3>
   2 I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. 
 1)  3 You shall have no other gods before me. 
 2)  4 You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.    
     5 You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin
     of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me,
   6 but showing love to a thousand {generations} of those who love me and keep my commandments. 
 3)  7 You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name.
 4)  8 Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.
   9 Six days you shall labor and do all your work,
  10 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter,
     nor your manservant or maidservant, nor your animals, nor the alien within your gates.
  11 For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day.
     Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy. 
 5) 12 Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the LORD your God is giving you. 
 6) 13 You shall not murder. 
 7) 14 You shall not commit adultery. 
 8) 15 You shall not steal. 
 9) 16 You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor. 
10) 17 You shall not covet your neighbor's house.  You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his manservant or maidservant, his ox
     or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.

<h3>Exodus 34:14-26, The other Ten Commandments. (approximate numbering)<br>
(Note that this is the only set of stone tablets that were called "The Ten Commandments.")</h3>
 1) 14 Do not worship any other god, for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.
 2) 15 Be careful not to make a treaty with those who live in the land; for when they prostitute themselves to their gods and
     sacrifice to them, they will invite you and you will eat their sacrifices.
  16 And when you choose some of their daughters as wives for your sons and those daughters prostitute themselves to their gods,
     they will lead your sons to do the same.
 3) 17 Do not make cast idols.
 4) 18 Celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread.  For seven days eat bread made without yeast, as I commanded you.
     Do this at the appointed time in the month of Abib, for in that month you came out of Egypt.
 5) 19 The first offspring of every womb belongs to me, including all the firstborn males of your livestock, whether from herd or flock.
  20 Redeem the firstborn donkey with a lamb, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck.  Redeem all your firstborn sons.
     No one is to appear before me empty-handed.
 6) 21 Six days you shall labor, but on the seventh day you shall rest; even during the plowing season the harvest you must rest.
 7) 22 Celebrate the Feast of Weeks with the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering at the turn of the year.
  23 Three times a year all your men are to appear before the Sovereign LORD, the God of Israel.
  24 I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your territory, and no one will covet your land when you go up three
     times each year to appear before the LORD your God.
 8) 25 Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to me along with anything containing yeast, and do not let any of the sacrifice from the
     Passover Feast remain until morning.
 9) 26 Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the LORD your God.
10)    Do not cook a young goat in its mother's milk.
  27 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Write down these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with
     Israel."
  28 Moses was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights without eating bread or drinking water.  And he wrote on the tablets
     the words of the covenant - the Ten Commandments.
