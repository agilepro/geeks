"Islam is the religion of those who struggle for truth and justice,
of those who clamor for liberty and independence. It is the school of
those who fight against colonialism. Moslems have no alternative, if
they wish to correct the balance of society, and force those in power
to confrm to the laws and principles of Islam, to an armed holy war
against profane governments.<p>

"Holy war means the conquest of all non-Moslem territories. Such a
war may well be declared after the formation of an Islamic government
worthy of that name, at the direction of the Iman or under his order.
It will then be the duty of every able-bodied adult male to volunteer
for this war of conquest, the final aim of which is to put Koranic Law
into power from one end of the earth to the other.<p>

"The Friday prayers were the means of mobilizing the people, of
inspiring them to battle. The man who goes to war straight from the
mosque is afraid of only one thing - God. Dying, poverty, and
homelessness mean nothing to him; an army of men like that is a
victorious army.<p>

"We have no recourse other than to overthrow all governments that do
not rest on pure Islamic principles, and are thus corrupt and
corrupting, and to tear down the traitorous, rotten, unjust, and
tyrannical administrative systems that serve them. That is not only
our duty in Iran, but it is also the duty of all Moslems in the world,
to carry the Islamic political revolution to its final victory.<p>
