<h1>Jesus Bans "Christian" Group</h1>
<h2>Shocking announcement sends militant Focus on the Family organization into
crazed tailspin</h2><font face="geneva,arial" size=2>-
<a href=mailto:mmorford@sfgate.com>By Mark Morford, SF Gate Columnist</a><br>
Friday, December 9, 2005<br></font><p><b><font size=5>I</font></b>n an astonishing but not
completely unexpected announcement, Jesus H. Christ, vice president and CFO
of All That Is Inc., appeared today on a large tortilla at a roadside taco
stand in Zacatecas, Mexico, to announce that, effective immediately, the
pseudo-Christian group Focus on the Family, led by Dr. James Dobson and best
known for its blazing hatred of gays and its fear of glimpsing the human
female nipple during nationally televised sporting events, is effectively
banned from His Divine Beneficence.
<p>"What happened was, the heavens and all spirits of goodness, along with
Buddha and Shiva and Allah and Kali and a few others, well, we were having
some margaritas and playing poker and tossing around recent headlines, when
Allah chimed in that this Focus on the Family group -- a real scab on my big
toe for years, I gotta tell you -- well, they just decided to yank all their
accounts from a bank over the bank's support of gay rights," said Jesus,
dressed in black Diesel jeans, Hugo Boss motorcycle boots and a snug tank
top featuring a large OM symbol across the chest.
<p>"J-Dog," as he is known to his friends, was referring, of course, to the
recent story about how the militant, Colorado-based "Christian" group has just
<a target="_blank" href=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/12/06/MNG5TG3K661.DTL>
pulled all its accounts from Wells Fargo Bank</a> after learning that the
bank had donated a small sum of money to gay rights causes, including GLAAD,
a sum totaling about $50,000, or about one-tenth of
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.buyblue.org/node/2156/view/summary">what
Wells Fargo gave to the GOP last year</a>.
<p>The Christ, apparently, had had enough.
<p>"This is what I realized: Rampant homophobia, ignorance of sex, derision
of women's rights, a decided love of tepid dogmatic sameness at the expense
of the luminosity and uniqueness of the individual human soul -- it was all
just too much," Jesus said, this time appearing as a curiously shaped oil
stain on a freeway underpass in Saragossa, Spain. "Then the bank thing
happened and it was the straw that broke the Mary's back."
<p>It was, apparently, the right response. "Totally in the moment," said
Buddha, nodding vigorously in agreement. "It's about time," Vishnu sighed,
painting his nails beet red and lighting some Nag Champa incense. "It's
decisive and it sends a message," agreed Kali, counting her poker winnings.
"You guys have any hummus?" Allah muttered, rifling through Christ's
well-stocked fridge and not really paying attention.
<p>"A slight ban is definitely in order," Christ continued, calmly, now
appearing in a pile of instant mashed potatoes in a truck stop in Bowling
Green, Ky., where his visage appeared to be weeping, but which Jesus said
was merely caused by all the onions he'd been chopping to make his famed
"Holy Christ!" hot salsa for the Seraphim Christmas office party.
<p>"Nothing serious, just maybe three, four thousand years wherein these
Focus on the Family nutballs and especially this hateful Dobson fellow shall
receive only sporadic blessings and deferred prayer responses and will have
to go all the way to the back of the line, behind Dick Cheney and Tim LaHaye
and Mel Gibson, to await salvation."
<p>"Hell, I still love them all. Even Dobson," the One added, flashing his
trademark dazzling, compassionate grin. "I just don't <i>like</i> them very
much."
<p>When the news reached Focus on the Family's Colorado Springs
headquarters, stunned members were seen running into walls and bashing their
foreheads with large Bibles and ramming their Toyota Corollas and Ford
pickups into each other and muttering incoherent lines from "Passion of the
Christ" and popping Prozac like M&amp;M's.
<p>"Where are the Ken dolls! Someone get to the dungeon and make sure my Ken
doll collection is safe!" screamed James Dobson himself, emerging from a
secret room in a fuchsia leotard and launching into a bizarre rant no one
could quite understand. Reporters seeking comment could only look at each
other in stunned silence, wishing they could be in a bar somewhere.
<p>In related news, the Tupelo, Miss.-based American Family Association,
another right-wing, anti-gay Christian group that allegedly pressured Ford
Motor Co. into
<a target="_blank" href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2005/12/06/financial/f102521S81.DTL">
yanking much of its advertising from upscale gay publications</a>, has,
apparently, accidentally banned itself.
<p>"Someone who is no longer in the organization had the bright idea that we
should ban any American company or group that supported the outright
ignorance of Christ's true message," sighed AFA chairman Donald Wildmon,
chugging from a large bottle of Red Bull and stroking the hairless cat in
his lap and making a strange hissing noise with his tongue. "Hell, it
sounded great at the 'Harry Potter' book-burning rally. But then again, most
everyone was buzzed on spiked Kool-Aid and Kumbaya pie."
<p>"Turns out, when all votes were counted, the group that most needed
banning, besides the Catholic church and Dobson's clan, was us. Apparently,
we have no real clue as to what Christ truly stood for. Who knew?"
<p>Effective immediately, the AFA's ban on itself means its members will no
longer be able support or endorse anything it says or does, until further
notice from itself.
<p>"It makes shopping, like, totally impossible," said Beth-Ann Binderbottom,
mother of nine and AFA member for the past 17 years and devout watcher of
"Touched by an Angel" and committed scourer of all live radio and TV
programming for any trace of female nipples, curse words or Jessica
Simpson's butt.
<p>"Due to the ban on myself, I now I have to buy the exact opposite of
everything I would normally buy," she lamented. "What the gosh-golly heck am
I supposed to do with all these green vegetables, Tom Robbins books, bottles
of wine and hot porn DVDs?"
<p>Christ, who will be in negotiations with the lords of the underworld next
week about what can be done about Jerry Falwell, summarized it this way:
"Hell, at the root of it, we're all pagans," JC said with a wink, from a
lovely pattern of bark on an old-growth sycamore in a heavily wooded forest somewhere in Bavaria.
