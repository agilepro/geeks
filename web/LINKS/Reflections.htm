Sensing that I was largely
unmoved by his convictions
and religious overtures (an
adroit observation of which
he was not disabused), my
exasperated patient at last
conceded, “Kim, all I want
is the truth.”&nbsp; “No, my
friend,” I silently
reflected, “What you want is
the assurance that your
existence has divine purpose
and that somehow your
essence will survive the
harshness of death.&nbsp; Your
church is true, not for
empirical reasons, but only
in the sense that its
doctrines assuage paralyzing
fears and renders comfort
where haunting doubt is
otherwise left to torment a
listless mind.”&nbsp; </font>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let us recall
that in his heralded work <i>
The Fall</i>, Camus saw
truth as a “lucid
intoxication,”</font><a title target="_blank" name="_ednref1"><span class="EC_MsoEndnoteReference"><span
style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[1]</span></span></a><font face="Times New Roman">

blinds.”</font><a title target="_blank" name="_ednref2"><span class="EC_MsoEndnoteReference"><span
style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[2]</span></span></a><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;
He further noted that
“Falsehood, on the contrary,
is a beautiful twilight that
enhances every object.”</font><a title target="_blank" name="_ednref3"><span class="EC_MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[3]</span></span></a><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;
Unwittingly, perhaps, man
tends to beautify what he
sees, morphing his
perceptions into something
more splendid, familiar, or
palatable.&nbsp; In other words,
lavishly apply the makeup
and even the most pernicious
falsehoods are allowed to
parade as truth.&nbsp ;</font></span></p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Religious views
must not be seen as
templates of reality, no
matter how rabid the desire
or sincere the intent.&nbsp; For
anyone to say that they
believe, or that they
disbelieve, is, for me, an
utterly meaningless and
pointless disclosure.&nbsp; It is
the <i>basis</i> of our
beliefs which sets us apart
and <i>not</i> the sincerity
or strength of our
convictions.&nbsp; Voltaire
reasoned that as a watch
proves a watchmaker, so too
does the universe prove a
god.&nbsp; But if that were true
then we are left with an
even more perplexing
question: Who created the
watchmaker?&nbsp; Or to believers
who speak of an
anthropomorphic or
compositional god, we ask,
“Who composed the
Composer?”&nbsp; The problem soon
becomes one of infinite
regress.</font></span></p>

&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Evolutionary
biologist Richard Dawkins
invites reflection by way of
a provocative question posed
by writer Douglas Adams:&nbsp;
“Isn’t it enough to see that
a garden is beautiful
without having to believe
that there are fairies at
the bottom of it too?”</font><a title target="_blank" name="_ednref4"><span class="EC_MsoEndnoteReference"><span

If by ascribing to the
Judeo-Christian-Islamic god
mythological origins and
attributes makes me an
atheist, then so, too, may
the believing reader be
considered heretical for
having ever uttered
animadversions of the Greek
god Apollo.&nbsp; Carl Sagan
reminds us that in the eyes
of the Roman Empire,
Christians were atheists for
not accepting “the divinity
of apotheosized emperors or
Olympian gods.”</font><a title target="_blank" name="_ednref5"><span class="EC_MsoEndnoteReference"><span

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As a child
reared under the religious
canopy of Mormonism, I was
destined to frame probing
and pointed questions with
the regularity of a Swiss
time piece.&nbsp; My father did
his best, I suppose, to
endure the overtones of
incredulity that originated
from my parched lips and
reeling mind.&nbsp; “Son, it’s
okay to question,” he
assured me, “but never doubt
that what the Church teaches
is true.”&nbsp; (Latter-day
Saints hold to the belief
that God would never allow
Church leaders to lead them
astray.)&nbsp; “But if denied the
freedom to doubt,” I
wondered, “What purpose does
the question serve?”&nbsp; After
40 years of waiting, I have
not yet received a credible
answer. </font></span></p>
<p class="EC_MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Times New Roman">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I do not oppose
the discovery of God any
more than I oppose the
discovery of a <i>unified
field theory</i>.&nbsp; What I
oppose are premature
declarations and
celebrations.&nbsp; Unlike
scientists who are held
accountable to the most
rigorous and imposing
standards of investigation,
and whose research is always
subject to independent
testing and peer review;
organized religion only
scoffs at such vexing
protocols, refusing to
defend or debate what for
them is sacrosanct.&nbsp; No
amount of evidence will
tarnish or rebuff religious
convictions.&nbsp; If the
scriptures teach that Jesus
walked on water, then, by
damned, he walked on water.&nbsp;
Amazingly, not a mewling of
suspicion or protest is
heard to emerge from the
pews.&nbsp; Sadly, it seems, in
the cathedral, temple, or
synagogue; evidence, reason,
and logic have no voice.&nbsp;
With hubristic certainty,
ecclesiastical authority
speaks <i>a posteriori</i>
of a yet-to-be-proven God,
to include a command of what
his Lordship thinks, says,
and does.&nbsp; Even God’s gender
(“Heavenly Father”) and
eternal ambitions</font><a title target="_blank" name="_ednref6"><span class="EC_MsoEndnoteReference"><span
style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[6]</span></span></a><font face="Times New Roman">
are said to be known by a
privileged few.&nbsp;
Conspicuously absent in
their confident rhetoric,
however, are bona fide
specifics and the hard
evidence to which
disciplined and critical
thinkers are accustomed.&nbsp; A
discerning Scott Atran
adduces that religion is
here to stay, for with
uncanny persistence,
“Religion survives science
and secular ideology …
because of what it
affectively and collectively
secures for people.”</font><a title target="_blank" name="_ednref7"><span class="EC_MsoEndnoteReference"><span
style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[7]</span></span></a><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;
In the light of such
awareness, Atran believed
that “All human societies
pay a price for religion’s
material, emotional, and
cognitive commitments to
unintuitive, factually
impossible worlds.”</font><a title target="_blank" name="_ednref8"><span class="EC_MsoEndnoteReference"><span
style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[8]</span></span></a><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;
It seems apparent, to even
the most myopic observer,
that people value security
<i>more</i> than they value
truth.&nbsp; We will agree with
Socrates when he reminds
Gorgias that the physician’s
sage advice is no match for
the tasty delights of a
pastry chef.&nbsp; </font></span>

How splendidly convenient!&nbsp;
Likewise, some will see in
<i>Fibonacci numbers</i> and
the <i>Golden Ratio </i>
(a.k.a. the <i>Divine
Proportion</i>) evidence of
deliberate design, if not
the very fingerprint of
God.&nbsp; But too often we see
something that simply isn’t
there.&nbsp; I cringe whenever I
hear what believers “know to
be true.”&nbsp; Let’s be honest,
shall we?&nbsp; What the believer
professes to know is little
more than what he believes;
and since his beliefs are
all he knows, such beliefs
(in his mind, at least) are
granted the currency of
knowledge.&nbsp; But at best,
such knowledge is an <i>
apparent </i>knowledge, and
appearances are seductively
deceiving, as the clergy
have so capably
demonstrated.&nbsp; Never
underestimate the power of a
determined mind and a
designing heart.&nbsp; </font>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then, again, it
could be said that I, too,
am a believer. &nbsp;I believe
that to walk alone by faith
is to abdicate an onerous
responsibility to knowledge,
in that faith seeks to
excuse and abet a malignant
complacency.&nbsp; In religious
circles faith has shamefully
become a convenient and
accredited substitute for
knowledge.&nbsp; Why bother with
knowledge when, according to
Jesus, the “faith of a
child” is the truest measure
of one’s discipleship?&nbsp;
Although touted as a virtue,
faith is an insidious fire
fanned by zealous acolytes
whose insatiable drive for a
contrived purity blinds
their narrow and ametropic
vision of reality.&nbsp; I
believe that faith is the
invocation of a leadership
gasping for breath in an
atmosphere befouled by false
confidence and baleful
arrogance.&nbsp; Under the
protective light of faith,
counterfactual beliefs are
held to be inviolable and
are, therefore, immune to
the corrective measures of
falsification.&nbsp; In short,
faith operates outside the
bounds of reason and logic.&nbsp;
No longer willing to mask
his contempt, this writer
will be excused for smiling
as the ostrich regales us
with a colorful description
of the landscape, as seen
through eyes whose head is
buried in the sand.</font></span></p>

appearance.”</font><a title target="_blank" name="_ednref10"><span class="EC_MsoEndnoteReference"><span

Falling in love with
religious beliefs is
tantamount to knowing in a
way that is false.&nbsp; With
other doting romantics, I
long to believe that the
swell of warm emotion one
feels at the moment of a
tender embrace portends an
eternal repose.&nbsp; But such
yearnings, however
passionate and common, more
likely reflect a
neurochemical cascade than
they do the dulcet
whispering of God’s voice to
a soft and vulnerable
heart.&nbsp; Based upon the
evidence, I soberly choose
to conduct my existence as a
contemplative disbeliever
than as an intoxicated plebe
groomed only to march with
gilded precision.&nbsp; Moreover,
I would characterize myself
as a <i>studied</i> atheist,
not because I wish to be
seen as a contumacious
intellectual, but because I
have studied my way out of
religion’s suffocating
miasma and sculpted instead
a sanctuary in which my mind
is free to think and to
ponder.&nbsp; Having rid myself
of a fantastical hope for an
afterlife, I am able to live
in the “here and now” and
thus make full use of what
precious time my existence
affords.</font></span></p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have gleaned
more from my secular studies
than was ever realized from
(what turned out to be)
unidirectional petitions to
God.&nbsp; My own heuristic has
demonstrated that one may no
more discourse with God than
with a yet-to-be-conceived
child.&nbsp; The exercise of
praying may be harmless, but
from such an investment one
must not expect a bountiful
harvest.&nbsp; Whereas in my
youth I was censured for
minting unpopular questions,
the advice I offer my own
children and grandchildren
is far less pedantic but
equally direct: Challenge <i>
everything</i> I have taught
you and <i>everything </i>I
have written.&nbsp; But I’ve also
shared with those nearest
and dearest that a life
devoted alone to questioning
and challenging authority is
terribly dull, if not
tediously irrelevant.&nbsp; I
state with conviction that a
life without color and élan
becomes a vacuous event
rehearsed upon a barren
