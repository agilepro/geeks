<h1>CHIMPS MAKE MONKEYS OUT OF HUMANS</h1>
<h2>Surprise Result In Short-Term Memory Test</h2>
By Malcolm Ritter<br>Associated Press<br>12/04/2007<p>
NEW YORK - Think you're smarter than a fifth-grader? How about a
5-year-old chimp? Japanese researchers
pitted young chimps against human adults in
tests of short-term memory, and overall, the
chimps won.
<p>That challenges the belief of many
people, including many scientists, that
"humans are superior to chimpanzees in all
cognitive functions," said researcher
Tetsuro Matsuzawa of Kyoto University.
<p>Matsuzawa, a pioneer in studying the
mental abilities of chimps, said even he was
surprised. He and colleague Sana Inoue
report the results in today's issue of the
journal Current Biology.
<p>One memory test included three 5-year-old
chimps who'd been taught the order of Arabic
numerals 1 through 9, and a dozen human
volunteers.
<p>They saw nine numbers displayed on a
computer screen. When they touched the first
number, the other eight turned into white
squares. The test was to touch all these
squares in the order of the numbers that
used to be there.
<p>Results showed that the chimps, while no
more accurate than the people, could do this
faster.
<p>One chimp, Ayumu, did the best.
Researchers included him and nine college
students in a second test.
<p>This time, five numbers flashed on the
screen only briefly before they were
replaced by white squares. The challenge,
again, was to touch these squares in the
proper sequence.
<p>When the numbers were displayed for about
seven-tenths of a second, Ayumu and the
college students were both able to do this
correctly about 80 percent of the time.
<p>But when the numbers were displayed for
just four-tenths or two-tenths of a second,
the chimp was the champ. The briefer of
those times is too short to allow a look
around the screen, and in those tests Ayumu
still scored about 80 percent, while humans
plunged to 40 percent.<p>
That indicates Ayumu was better at taking in
the whole pattern of numbers at a glance,
the researchers wrote.<p>
"It's amazing what this chimpanzee is able
to do," said Elizabeth Lonsdorf, director of
the Lester E. Fisher Center for the Study
and Conservation of Apes at the Lincoln Park
Zoo in Chicago.<p>
What's going on here? Even with six months
of training, three students failed to catch
up to the three young chimps, Matsuzawa said
in an e-mail.<p>
He thinks two factors gave his chimps the
edge. For one thing, he believes human
ancestors gave up much of this skill over
evolutionary time to make room in the brain
for gaining language abilities.<p>
The other factor is the youth of Ayumu and
his peers. The memory for images that's
needed for the tests resembles a skill found
in children, but which dissipates with age.
