<h1>Is the universe fine-tuned for life?</h1>
by Michael Shermer<br>

<i>There was a young fellow from Trinity<br>
Who took the square root of infinity.<br>
But the number of digits<br>
Gave him the fidgets;<br>
He dropped Math and took up Divinity.</i><p>
In the limerick above, physicist George Gamow
dealt with the paradox of a finite being
contemplating infinity by passing the buck to
theologians.<p>
In an attempt to prove that the universe was
intelligently designed, religion has lately been
fidgeting with the fine-tuning digits of the
cosmos. The John Templeton Foundation even
grants cash prizes for such "progress in
religion." Last year mathematical physicist and
Anglican priest John C. Polkinghorne, recognized
because he "has invigorated the search for
interface between science and religion," was
given $1 million for his "treatment of theology
as a natural science." In 2000 physicist Freeman
Dyson took home a $945,000 prize for such works
as his 1979 book, Disturbing the Universe, in
which he writes: "As we look out into the
universe and identify the many accidents of
physics and astronomy that have worked together
to our benefit, it almost seems as if the
Universe must in some sense have known that we
were coming."<p>
Mathematical physicist Paul Davies also won a
Templeton prize. In his 1999 book, The Fifth
Miracle, he makes these observations about the
fine-tuned nature of the cosmos: "If life
follows from [primordial] soup with causal
dependability, the laws of nature encode a
hidden subtext, a cosmic imperative, which tells
them: 'Make life!' And, through life, its
by-products: mind, knowledge, understanding. It
means that the laws of the universe have
engineered their own comprehension. This is a
breathtaking vision of nature, magnificent and
uplifting in its majestic sweep. I hope it is
correct. It would be wonderful if it were
correct."<p>
Indeed, it would be wonderful. But not any more
wonderful than if it were not correct. Even
atheist Stephen W. Hawking sounded like a
supporter of intelligent design when he wrote:
"And why is the universe so close to the
dividing line between collapsing again and
expanding indefinitely?... If the rate of
expansion one second after the big bang had been
less by one part in 1010, the universe would
have collapsed after a few million years. If it
had been greater by one part in 1010, the
universe would have been essentially empty after
a few million years. In neither case would it
have lasted long enough for life to develop.
Thus one either has to appeal to the anthropic
principle or find some physical explanation of
why the universe is the way it is."<p>
<hr>We may live in a multiverse in which our universe is only one of many universes.<br>
<hr><br>
In its current version, the anthropic principle
posits that we live in a multiverse in which our
universe is only one of many universes, all with
different laws of nature. Those universes whose
parameters are most likely to give rise to life
occasionally generate complex life with brains
big enough to achieve consciousness and to
conceive of such concepts as God and cosmology
and to ask such questions as Why? Another
explanation can be found in the properties of
self-organization and emergence. Water is an
emergent property of a particular arrangement of
hydrogen and oxygen molecules, just as
consciousness is a self-organized emergent
property of billions of neurons. The evolution
of complex life is an emergent property of
simple life: prokaryote cells self-organized
into eukaryote cells, which self-organized into
multicellular organisms, which self-organized
into ... and here we are.<p>
Self-organization and emergence arise out of
complex adaptive systems that grow and learn as
they change. As a complex adaptive system, the
cosmos may be one giant autocatalytic
(self-driving) feedback loop that generates such
emergent properties as life. We can think of
self-organization as an emergent property and
emergence as a form of self-organization.
Complexity is so simple it can be put on a
bumper sticker: life happens.<p>
If life on earth is unique or at least
exceptionally rare (and in either case certainly
not inevitable), how special is our fleeting,
mayfly-like existence? And how important it is
that we make the most of our lives and our
loves; how critical it is that we work to
preserve not only our own species but all
species and the biosphere itself. Whether the
universe is teeming with life or we are alone,
whether our existence is strongly necessitated
by the laws of nature or highly contingent and
accidental, whether there is more to come or
this is all there is, we are faced with a
worldview that is breathtaking and majestic in
its sweep across time and space.
