Few people might be aware of this: There are passages in the Bible
that coincide with scientific principles that weren't discovered by
scientists until hundreds of years after the Bible had been written.
Here are some examples:<p>

Source: <a
href="http://www.bible.ca/b-science-evidences.htm">http://www.bible.ca/b-science-evidences.htm</a><p>

1. The Bible said the earth is round and is suspended in space:<p>

The earth is round!<p>

You may be surprised to learn that the Bible revealed that the earth
is round. Job 26:10, Prov 8:27, Isaiah 40:22, Amos 9:6. Today, we
chuckle at the people of the fifteenth century who feared sailing
because they thought they would fall over the edge of the flat earth.
Yet the Bible revealed the truth in 1000 B.C. 2500 years before man
discovered it for himself!<p>

In various verses, the Bible says the earth is round and hangs in
space. It took a long time for science to catch up and reach the same
conclusions. Copernicus made the discovery in 1475. But the Bible
always knew. Here are two related Bible verses that were written more
than 2500 years ago, and more than 1000 years before Copernicus:<p>

"He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth..." (Isaiah 40:22,NIV).
(By the way, the Hebrew language at that time did not have a
word for "sphere," only for "circle.")<p>

"He spreads out the northern [skies] over empty space; he suspends
the earth over nothing" (Job 26:7, NIV).<p>

"Paths of the sea"
Matthew Maury (1806-1873) is considered the father of oceanography.
He was bed-ridden during a serious illness and asked his son to read
a portion of the Bible to him. While listening, he noticed the
expression "paths of the sea" in Psalms 8:8. Upon his recovery, Maury
took God at his word and went looking for these paths. We are
indebted to his discovery of the warm and cold continental currents.<p>

His book on oceanography is still considered a basic text on the
subject and is still used in universities. Maury used the Bible as a<br
guide to scientific discovery. If only more would use the Bible as<br
a guide in their personal lives!<p>

2. The Bible described the Hydrologic Cycle:<p>

Revealed in the Bible: Job 36:27-28
The water cycle was not fully understood until about 30 B.C. by a
Roman engineer named Marcus Vitruvius. Yet every aspect of the water
cycle was fully revealed to mankind in 1600 B.C.! The Bible's
description is in perfect harmony with modern science. Eccl 1:6-7;
11:3; Job 26:8; Amos 9:6. Vitruvius was 1600 years too late!<p>

In various passages, the Bible describes a hydrologic cycle, the
process by which clouds are formed, rain is produced and ground water
is replenished. Science made the same discovery in the 1600s, long
after the Bible passages were written. Here are the related Bible
verses:<p>

"He wraps up the waters in his clouds, yet the clouds do not burst
under their weight" (Job 26:8, NIV).<p>

"He draws up the drops of water, which distill as rain to the
streams; the clouds pour down their moisture and abundant showers
fall on mankind" (Job 36:27-28, NIV).<p>

"The wind blows to the south and turns to the north; round and round
it goes, ever returning on its course. All streams flow into the sea,
yet the sea is never full. To the place the streams come from, there
they return again" (Ecclesiastes 1:6-7, NIV).<p>

3. The Bible stated that the stars cannot be counted:
For centuries, scientists and astronomers thought they could count
the precise number of stars in the universe. Brahe, for example, said
there were 777. Kepler claimed the total was 1,005. Hipparchus said
there were 1,022 stars. Ptolemy raised the number to 1,056.
Eventually, scientists, including the great Galileo, concluded that
the stars could not be numbered, just as the Bible had always
claimed:<p>

"I will make the descendants of David my servant and the Levites who
minister before me as countless as the stars of the sky and as
measureless as the sand on the seashore" (Jeremiah 33:22, NIV).<p>

He took him outside and said, "Look up at the heavens and count the
stars--if indeed you can count them." Then he said to him, "So
shall
your offspring be." (Genesis 15:5, NIV).<p>

4. The Bible stated the existence of valleys and springs in the seas:
Only until the past few hundred years did people have the technology
to discover that there are deep valleys and fresh water springs in
the oceans. But the Bible always knew:<p>

"The valleys of the sea were exposed and the foundations of the earth
laid bare at the rebuke of the Lord. . . " (2 Samuel 22:16, NIV).<p>

"In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, on the seventeenth day of
the second month--on that day all the springs of the great deep burst
forth, and the floodgates of the heavens were opened. " (Genesis
7:11, NIV).<p>

5. The Bible stated that kind words and laughter are good for one's
health:
In recent years, American newspapers have published various reports
that laughter releases chemicals within a person's body that can
contribute to one's health. And, that depression and stress can
weaken the immune system and contribute to various health problems.
But, the Bible knew of the health virtues of laughter roughly 3000
years ago when the Bible's book of Proverbs was recorded:<p>

"Pleasant words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and healing to the
bones." (Proverbs 16:24, NIV).<p>

"A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the
bones." (Proverbs 17:22, NIV).<p>

6. The Bible stated that stars differ from one another centuries
before scientists reached the same conclusion:
Today we know that the stars in the skies are very different from one
another, that they are made up of differing concentrations of
different elements, and that they vary in their sizes, their ages and
in their proximity to the earth. But the ancient people had no way to
prove this. Even so, Paul, who received many insights from Jesus,
wrote a passage about 2000 years ago in the Bible's book of 1
Corinthians that said that the stars in the heavens did indeed differ
from one another:<p>

"The sun has one kind of splendor, the moon another and the stars
another; and star differs from star in splendor."
(1 Corinthians 15:41).
God used "anesthesia" before it was even discovered:<p>

gen. 2:21, "so the Lord God caused the man to fall into a deep
sleep ; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs..."<p>

God commanded the hebrews to cleanse themselves with fresh water even
before the discovery of bacteria(God is in the tomorrow already!)<p>

lev. 15:13, "...he must wash his clothes and bathe himself with fresh
water, and he will be clean."<p>

I am a nurse, and if we have patients with contagious disease or
condition we isolate them. but God commanded this a long time ago:<p>

lev. 13:46, "as long as he has the infection, he remains unclean. he
must live alone . he must live outside the camp.<p>

why do health officials quarantine infectious individuals? so they
won't spread infection. God knew it even before they did!<p>

The bible describes the precision of movement in the universe:<p>

jer. 31:35, "thus says the Lord, who gives the sun for a light by
day, the ordinances of the moon and the stars for a light by night,
who disturbs the sea and its waves roar..."<p>

The bible describes the circulation of atmosphere:<p>

ecc. 1:6, "the wind goes toward the south and turns around to the
north, the wind whirls about continually and comes again on its
circuit."<p>

The bible includes some principles of fluid dynamics:<p>

job 28:25, "to establish the weight for a wind and apportion the
waters by measure."<p>

lev.17:11 describes the value of blood, "for the life of the flesh is
in the blood..."<p>

The bible describes something like a television, probably a satellite
TV that will allow everyone to see a single event:<p>

rev. 11:19, "...then those from the peoples, tribes, tongues and
nations will see their dead bodies for three and one half days..."<p>

6 DAY CREATION...<p>

GOD WAS TAKING HIS TIME
If a fair maiden kisses a frog which instantly changes into a
handsome prince, we would call it a fairy tale. But if the change
takes 40 million years, we call it evolution. We often hear that
science has proved evolution. Nothing could be further from the
truth. You see, people often confuse scientific fact with scientific
theory. Current scientific theory does conflict with creation. But
the facts of science do not! There are many scientists who fully
accept Biblical creation. Surprised?<p>

The theory of evolution says that over millions of years simple life
forms (one celled creatures) slowly evolved into complex life forms
(fish), and that one kind of animal evolved into another kind (ape to
man). Genesis, on the other hand, says that all life forms were
created in six, 24 hour days. Genesis chapter one states 10 times
that life forms can only reproduce after their own kind (ape to ape,
man to man).<p>

All the observable facts of science strongly support the Bible's
claim that it is impossible for one kind to reproduce a different
kind. The truth is, there is absolutely no tangible evidence to
support evolution from any area of science, just theory and a wild
imagination!<p>

But if the Bible is wrong and man actually did evolve in small
graduations over a long period of time, we should find ample fossil
evidence of links in intermediate stages of transition. For decades,
evolutionists have searched for fossils of these links to prove
biblical creation wrong. Although millions of fossils have been
unearthed, not even one missing link has ever been found. Has it ever
occurred to you that this is the reason why scientists refer to them
as missing links?<p>

Even Charles Darwin realized the difficulty missing links gave his
theory. Darwin wrote in his book, Origin Of The Species, "Why, if
species have descended from other species by fine graduation, do we
not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms? Why is not all
nature in confusion, instead of the species being, as we see them,
well defined?" The reason we have never found any missing links is
quite simple. Darwin's theory of evolution is wrong!<p>

Experts tricked for 40 years!
In 1912, Arthur Woodward announced to the world that he had found the
missing link between ape and man. Piltdown Man, as he called it,
consisted of a jaw bone and a piece of skull which he estimated to be
over 500,000 years old! However, in 1953, when the new fluoride
dating process was applied to the bones, scientists were shocked to
learn that the jaw bone was less than 50 years old.<p>

Only then did they notice that the bones and teeth had been treated
with salts and filed to make them appear old and primitive. In other
words, Piltdown Man was a complete fraud.
Take note Bible student! The world's foremost scientific experts had
been fooled for over 40 years! (Read 1 Corinthians 3:18-20.) For
almost a half century, evolutionists pushed Piltdown Man in the faces
of Bible believers as scientific proof we evolved from apes! Some
proof!<p>

In spite of over 100 years of intensive searching, the only place you
will find a missing link today is in the colourful imagination of an
evolutionist. Museums certainly don't have any! "In the beginning God
created the heavens and the earth." (Gen 1:1) Have you ever
considered that when God created the universe in six short 24 hour
days, He may have been taking His time?<p>

Although the Bible is not primarily a book of science, it does
contain numerous scientific facts. We laugh at the scientific
knowledge of just a hundred years ago. If man alone were the author
of the Bible, we would expect to find many such humorous errors
contained in it. However, if we examine the scientific data of the
Bible and find it to be accurate to present-day knowledge, then we
have powerful evidence for divine authorship.<p>

The scientific facts we are about to examine are not only accurate,
but were revealed thousands of years before man discovered them for
himself. The Bible does not contain any errors typical of the time in
which it was written. Would we expect anything less from a book
written by God?<p>

The Bible is a reliable book of genuine divine prophecy. You can
trust it!
The evidence presented here is just a tiny portion of the proofs
available to establish the divine origin of the Bible. Yet, they are
more than sufficient to prove the inspiration of the Bible. There
will always be men who scoff at the Bible. You, however, can be
confident when you read your Bible that God is the author, for it is
written:<p>

"We constantly thank God that when you received from us the word of
God's message, you accepted it not as the word of men, but for what
it really is, the word of God" (1 Thessalonians 2:13).<p>

The Bible is the world's all-time best selling book. About 2.5
billion copies have been printed which are available in over 700
languages. Although the Bible has enjoyed such vast distribution and
attention, it is read relatively little. Perhaps part of the reason
the Bible is so neglected is the many doubts people have about this
unique book. If the Bible came from the mouth of God, then the
scriptures are believable when they speak of Jesus Christ and
accurate when they touch the realm of science.<p>

All scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching, for
reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; that the man
of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work. (2 Timothy
3:16,17)<p>

The word "inspired" (theopneustos) in the original Greek language
literally means "God-breathed". When the Bible claims to be inspired,
we understand therefore, that it came from the mouth of God. It is
God-breathed, inspired.<p>

But a skeptic will say, "Everyone knows the Bible was written by men!
The book of 1 Corinthians, for example, was written by a man named Paul.
After all, the very first verse bears his name as the "author."
In reply to this we answer: "Yes, 1 Corinthians was written by Paul.
Notice however, what Paul said in chapter 14, verse 37: "the things I
write to you are the Lord's commandment."<p>

Paul knew the source of his writings and understood that he was like
a pen in the hand of Almighty God. We must not view the Bible as the
word of Paul, Peter, or Jeremiah, but rather, as the message God
revealed through these men just as it is written in Jeremiah 1:9,<p>

Then the Lord stretched out his hand and touched my mouth, and the
Lord said to me, 'behold, I have put my words in your mouth'.<p>

The Bible writers were not like news reporters giving their personal
interpretation of events they eye-witnessed, but were divinely guided
as 2 Peter 1:20-21 says,<p>

Above all, you must understand that no prophesy of scripture came
about by the prophet's own interpretation. For prophecy never had its
origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were
carried along by the Holy Spirit.<p>

God and man worked together in writing the scriptures. However, in
this work, God is the author who dictated the message, and man is the
writing instrument. Men were guided or inspired to write the exact
message God wanted recorded in the Bible. Now that we have a
fundamental understanding of inspiration and the origin of the Bible,
let us look at some evidence of inspiration.<p>

"We constantly thank God that when you received from us the word of
God's message, you accepted it not as the word of men, but for what
it really is, the word of God" (1 Thessalonians 2:13).</span>
