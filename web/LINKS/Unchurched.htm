<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: blue">This
is an interesting article, in large part for what it leaves out. It
has far more content about religion, and interviews many religious
leaders, a few non-religious people, but no non-religious leaders.
<p>It makes statements that presume that those who don't go to church are
actually religious, just 'unchurched'. In the end, it implies that
spirituality and values education are in the realm of religion. It
does have some interesting data on religious beliefs by state. In
California, 19% of people said that they had no religion. Only the
Catholics at 32% have a larger proportion.<p>

by Cathy Lynn Grossman, USA TODAY
<p>SEATTLE — Americans almost all say religion
matters, yet more people than ever are opting out. Not just out of
the pews. Out from under a theological roof altogether. In 2001,
more than 29.4 million Americans said they had no religion — more
than double the number in 1990, and more than Methodists, Lutherans
and Episcopalians all added up — according to the American Religious
Identification Survey 2001 (ARIS).

State-by-state breakdown of religious backgrounds</a>
</ul>
<p>People with no religion now account for 14%
of the nation, up from 8% when The Graduate Center of the City
University of New York, authors of the ARIS, conducted its first
survey of religion in 1990. Today the range stretches from 3% with
no religion in North Dakota to 25% in Washington state.
<p>For them, Sundays are just another Saturday.
<p>Laura Terry of Whidbey Island, Wash., spent a
recent Sunday watching her family scale the four-story rock spire at
sports mecca Recreational Equipment Inc. in downtown Seattle. While
she acknowledges a Catholic heritage, rules and rituals didn't
interest her.
<p>"We haven't gone to church since we were
children," she says. "Our kids go to (private) school, where they
learn the philosophy of all religions, and I think that's enough.
They're happiest when we're out looking for adventure every
weekend."
<p>The six states with the highest percentage of
people saying they have no religion are all Western states, with the
exception of Vermont at 22%.
<p>"I always think the West is leading not only
the U.S., but the world, that in a sense we are the edge of
history," says Donald Miller of the Center for Religion and Civic
Culture at the University of Southern California.
<p>But Miller can't say whether these statistics
are signs of a secular America to come, one nation under <i>whatever</i>,
or merely a reconfiguration of traditional beliefs under new
banners.
<p>Neither is there a way, yet, to measure the
impact of this increasingly restless spirit on society — in debates
on cloning, prayer in schools, abortion or the death penalty, in
votes for president of the nation or the local school board, in the
community roles played by churches, synagogues, mosques and temples.
<p>Look at two traditional venues of religious
expression: charity and values education.
<p>Giving USA, which tracks philanthropy, says
about half of all charitable dollars go to religious purposes.
Sylvia Ronsvalle of empty tomb inc., in Champaign, Ill., which
studies church giving, worries that if "religion doesn't teach the
basic lessons of personal giving, where will people learn it?"
<p>However, Carl Dudley of the Hartford (Conn.)
Seminary's Institute for Religion Research, which issued a study
last year examining the nation's 350,000 congregations, says
unchurched America, for all its glorification of individuality and
spiritual exploration, still puts mighty volunteer time and
financial muscle into programs to help communities. Programs such as
literacy training, scouting or AIDS walks "attract a lot of people
who act out their faith even if they don't confess it."
<p>"A huge number of people see volunteering for
a soup kitchen or tutoring children as a religious activity," Dudley
says. "This is the kind of altruism nurtured by the church but not
exclusive to it."
<p>The Rev. Stephen Burger, executive director
of the 270-member Association of Gospel Missions, recalls that
during the 15 years he served Seattle's Union Gospel Mission, "I had
many donors who didn't share my convictions but trusted what we did.
<p>"Our volunteers were the kind of people who
didn't show up out of custom, or to impress a boss or co-workers.
They came out of a real commitment to the work you are doing,"
Burger says. "Seattle, Los Angeles and San Jose aren't exactly
citadels of traditional religion, but the missions there are meeting
multimillion-dollar budgets."
<p>And parents who say they have no religion say
they, too, can teach their children well.
<p>"On Easter, my son and I go camping," says
Ralph Leitner of Seattle, as 10-year-old Peter conquers the REI
pinnacle. Leitner, an Eagle Scout, teaches a catechism of nature.
"You can't help but be spiritual out there."
<p>But that can be pretty thin gruel for soul
food, says Christian radio talk-show host Dick Staub, 53, who was
born and raised in the West. His show focuses on those junctures
"where belief meets real life."
<p>"Lots of people will tell you they are on a
spiritual journey," says Staub, a regular churchgoer. "Then along
comes a moment when something happens — your mother dies or your
child has cancer or Sept. 11 happens — and there you are wandering
around saying, 'Whatever.' People want help connecting, creating
community and seeing God in other people. But religious institutions
have been discredited, so they are trying to do it outside the
churches."
<p>A USA TODAY/Gallup Poll in January also finds
traces of this shift away from religious identity: 50% of Americans
call themselves religious, down from 54% in December 1999. But an
additional 33% call themselves "spiritual but not religious," up
from 30%, and about one in 10 say they are neither.
<p>Experts see people looking upward, inward,
online and out-of-doors for the comfort, connection and inspiration
they once sought in formal sanctuaries. Their "spirituality" is
unhemmed by ritual, Scripture or theology.
<p>"People aren't really saying, 'I have no
religion.' They are saying, 'None of the above,' " says University
of Washington sociologist Rodney Stark, co-author of <i>Acts of
Faith: Explaining the Human Side of Religion</i>.
<p>He sees the shift as an expression of
culture, history and immigration patterns — accentuated in the
Western states by waves of pioneers, refugees, entrepreneurs and
restless youth.
<p>"People who believe in God — and they do —
who pray — and they do — are not secular, they are just unchurched.
They've never been to church and, in many cases, their parents
didn't go either," Stark says.
<p>Mark Galli, managing editor of <i>Christianity Today</i>, the evangelical magazine founded by Billy
Graham, shakes his head for those soloists on the spirituality
frontier.
<p>"It's a cliché now to call institutional
religion 'oppressive, patriarchal, out of date and out of touch,' "
says Galli, who was a pastor in Sacramento for a decade.
<p>"So what else is new? I feel sorry for those
people who don't think there's anything greater than themselves. It
must feel like a lonely and frightening world for them.
<p>"Lone-ranger spirituality is not conducive to
taking us to the depths God designed us to go. It leaves out the
communal dimension of faith. If you leave out the irritations,
frustrations and joy that community entails, you miss something
about God."
<p>Among the majority who do claim a religious
identity, in the West and nationwide, some of the highest rates of
growth for all Christian groups were in the umbrella categories — 12
times more people call themselves "non-denominational" since 1990
and four times more call themselves evangelical.
<p>Sociologist Stark observes, "Most people
change <i>where</i> they go, not <i>whether</i> they go to church."
<p>Washington Cathedral, a thriving 2,000-member
evangelical Christian church nestled into a valley in Redmond,
Wash., buzzes with ministries for every niche group and social need.
Associate pastor Linda Skinner, 53, quips, "We are not organized
religion, we're disorganized religion. We like to say we're
'interdenominational,' since 'non-denominational' sounds so 'anti.'"
<p>The drum set, the video screen, the glass
wall of the sanctuary facing a man-made waterfall cascading into a
baptismal pool and an altar engraved with "God is Love" make it
inviting for worshipers to pick up a latte at the church coffee bar
and tote their cup on in for a rousing round of praising Jesus.
<p>"We say we major on the majors and minor on
the minors. There are some things specifically in the Bible that are
major: Jesus is the Son of God. He died on the cross so we may have
forgiveness of our sins. But all the other things, like what age to
baptize or how often to give communion and who gets communion, we
say are the minor things we can all disagree on," says Skinner,
skating past issues that once prompted wars.
<p>The majority of Americans, 81% according to
ARIS, still do claim a religion. They represent a counterargument to
the theory that the more developed a country — in education,
occupations, science and technology — the more its people move away
from religion, says Ronald Inglehart, who heads the Institute for
Social Research at the University of Michigan.
<p>Americans break the mold. Inglehart says,
"Even if you look at the easiest measure of religiosity — church
attendance — the USA has 30% to 32% per week depending on which poll
you look at, but comparably wealthy countries in Northern Europe
have 5% to 15%."
<p>According to the World Values Survey,
conducted by sociologists in 65 nations since 1981, "We see (a
religious attitude) when we ask how often people spend time thinking
about the meaning and purpose of life. We see it in people's
attitudes toward the environment and in the growth of a worldview
that sees all life as sacred and invests nature with dignity and
sacred quality," Inglehart says.
<p>"'Thou shalt not pollute' is a new
commandment that has snuck into the canon, even in public schools
where old-fashioned moral instruction is supposedly taboo. The
environmental and peace and gender-equality movements are clearly
inculcating values without being specifically religious," he says.
<p>The desire to explore and celebrate beliefs
and teach treasured values to the next generation is still with
Americans, even if they don't call it "religion," he says.
<p>"Contrary to the well-known secularization
theory that God is dead and will soon drop off the consciousness
map, the USA is a holdout. Spirituality is actually growing in the USA."
