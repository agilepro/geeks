<font size="6">Eternal Heavenly Servitude</font></strong></p>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoNormal">by Diderot Leumas<br><br>I have often wondered about the
Christian concept of heaven. The Christian concept of Hell is
well illustrated with vividly terrifying images in books such as
Revelation, Ezekiel, Daniel and most exquisitely horrifying of
all, Dante’s Inferno. Conversely, as a Christian, are you really
aware of what exactly heaven is like according to the Bible?</p>
<br>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoNormal">Many Christians may think that
it is being in the presence of God, or being one with God. The
first is partially correct but quite misleading. The second is
clearly wrong if God’s words are to be taken literally as
described in the biblical book of Revelation.</p>
<br>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoNormal">Take a moment and reflect. What
do you think you will be doing <b>FOR ETERNITY</b> in heaven?
Look inside you and consider what is it you WOULD LIKE to do FOR
EVER in heaven. Do you really want to spend ETERNITY<b>
contemplating the visage of God</b> and/or <b>Jesus</b>? Don’t
you think it will become somewhat boring after a millennium or
two, even if you were to keep alternating between the two and
despite the hymnals?</p>
<br>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoNormal">According to Revelation,<b>
<span style="color: maroon;">heaven is a bedazzling, bejeweled,
golden replica of Jerusalem</span></b> but without the wailing
wall or the temple of Solomon or the church of the Holy
Sepulcher and most definitely without the Dome Of The Rock. Also
presumably without the ghettos and slums of the current city. So
in reality it is not much of a replica. So why call it
Jerusalem?</p>
<br>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoNormal">Why is God so <b>obsessed</b>
with a city that was originally conquered from its rightful
owners (the Jebusites Joshua 15:63) by ordering and aiding
Joshua to genocide them (but failing mind you)?</p>
<br>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoNormal">Reflect on this for a moment:
God had to order some men to kill other men and take their city
from them so as to build him a house in it. Then he considers
this man made house the ONLY place on the WHOLE EARTH to be his
DWELLING in preference to the WHOLE UNIVERSE.</p>
<br>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoNormal">Now if you do not see this as
the action of a RETARDED BLOODTHIRSTY GOD then you must agree
that it is the writings of RETARDED BLOODTHIRSTY DESERT DWELLING
EVIL RACISTS who are on par if not worse than the icons of evil
and retardation called the Taliban. The Israelites according to
what the Bible depicts them to be are the 21<sup>st</sup>
Century BCE equivalent of the Taliban in the 21<sup>st</sup>
century CE. Any one who believes that this myth is holy is
sorely in need of a good wake up call.</p>
<br>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoNormal">Just as it is on earth, so it
is in the city of heaven. Gentiles STILL are second-class
citizens as far as Yahweh is concerned (see Romans 11:11-31 and
of course the rest of the Bible). Additionally, there will still
be “KINGS who bring their glory into the city” whatever that
means in the after life!</p>
<br>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoNormal">The city is to have 12 gates on
which will be written the names of the 12 children of Israel who
are wrongly listed in Revelation (7:4-8 compare to Genesis
49:2-28, Exodus 1:1-6 and Numbers 1:5-15). Why does the city of
heaven need twelve gates or walls altogether? Why are the 12
tribal names of the children of Jacob so darn important so as to
be EXALTED above any other nations or people in the entire
history of humanity? What did these desert-dwelling shepherds do
that is so special so as to deserve their names to be written
for ETERNITY on the 12 GATES of the ETERNAL HEAVENLY DWELLING
PLACE of GOD?</p>
<br>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoNormal">Did they not sell their brother
into slavery after trying to kill him (Genesis 37:18-29)? Didn’t
Judah father two children with his daughter-in-law after
contracting her as a prostitute (Genesis 38)? The entire Bible
is nothing but a chronicle of their atrocities against
sub-humans (gentiles) as well as each other; albeit at the
behest and with the aid of Yahweh himself. Read <b>Judges 19:23
to 21:25</b> for a <b>TYPICAL</b> Stomach Turning GRUESOME tail
of the cruelty, bloodthirstiness, sexism and utter viciousness
that Yahweh and his chosen people are capable of achieving.
These are the tribes whose names are to be ETCHED FOR ETERNITY
on the 12 useless gates of the CITY OF HEAVEN.</p>
<br>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoNormal">Notice how Yahweh does not
think that a SINGLE gentile deserves to have his or (horror of
horrors)<b> HER</b> name in an honored place. Not a single
gentile nation either. People like Isaac Newton, Edward Jenner
(Vaccine Inventor), Galileo Galilei, Marie Curie, Florence
Nightingale and Louis Pasteur were all Jesus Loving Good
Christians who raised humanity to a higher level of existence.
<b>Why do they not deserve at least a stone or brick named after
them?</b></p>
<br>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoNormal">Before you tell me it is
because they did not worship God well enough, go read Exodus,
Leviticus, Deuteronomy, both Kings, Both Samuels, both
Chronicles – oh heck read the entire damned bible – <b>every
other page</b> is about how the Israelites repeatedly and
insistently kept reverting to the worship of Baal, Ashtoreth and
Molech.</p>
<br>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoNormal">The Israelites seem to have <b>
LOVED BAAL</b> and only worshiped Yahweh after he <b>tortured</b>
them into submissive obedience. This occurred time and time
again <b>ad nauseam</b>. You might think that after having
millions of them killed in one horrifyingly painful torture
after another they would have learnt to fear such a
vengeful-bloodthirsty tyrant and to forget about the apparently
irresistibly lovable and more worship-worthy Baal. But they
apparently were a “<b><i>stiffnecked people</i></b>”
(Deuteronomy 9:6).</p>
<br>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">
Just as an example of the theme that repeats in almost every
other chapter in the bible see <b>Numbers 25:1-5</b></span></p>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoBodyTextIndent">
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">And Israel abode in Shittim, and
the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab.
And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their
gods: and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.
<b>And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor</b>: <b>and
the anger of the LORD was kindled</b> against Israel. And the
LORD said unto Moses, <b>Take all the heads of the people, and
hang them up before the LORD against the sun</b>, <b>that the
fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel</b>. And
Moses said unto the judges of Israel, <b>Slay ye every one his
men that were joined unto Baalpeor</b>.</span></p>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoBodyTextIndent"></p>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoBodyTextIndent"><b>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">This is the person bestowed with
<u>INFINITE WISDOM by Yahweh IN PERSON</u> (1 Kings 11:7-9)</span></b></p>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoBodyTextIndent">
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Then did Solomon build an high
place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is
before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the
children of Ammon. And likewise did he for all his strange
wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods. And
the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned
from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice,</span></p>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoNormal"></p>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoNormal"><b>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The Israelites were never really
monotheists. </span></b></p>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoNormal"><b>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Exodus 15:11</span></b><span style="font-size: 10pt;">
Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? </span></p>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoNormal"><b>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Exodus 18:11</span></b><span style="font-size: 10pt;">
Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: </span></p>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoNormal"><b>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Exodus 22:28</span></b><span style="font-size: 10pt;">
Thou shalt not revile the gods, <b><u>nor curse the ruler
of thy people</u></b>. (<b>What do Palin and the T-Party say to
this one</b>?) </span></p>
<br>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoBodyTextIndent2"><strong>
<font size="2">Along with Aaron, even after having just
witnessed all Yahweh’s mind boggling and
bloodthirsty miracles, they did this (Exodus 32:1-4)</font></strong></p>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoBodyTextIndent">
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">And when the people saw that
Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered
themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, <b>Up, make
us gods</b>, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses,
the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not
what is become of him. And he received them at their hand, and
fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten
calf: and they said, <b>These be thy <u>gods</u>, O Israel,
which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt</b></span>.</p>
<br>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoNormal">In this New Jerusalem God and
the Lamb (Jesus) will “dwell among the people” but not quite
among them. It would be more aptly described as OVER THEM
sitting on thrones made of gold, jewels, pearls, precious stones
and so on and so forth. Yahweh is blatantly an ostentatious
tyrannical KING.</p>
<br>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoNormal">The citizenship in heaven will
apparently be according to a strict <b>CAST SYSTEM</b>. Under
Yahweh and Jesus, there will be 24 “<b>elders</b>” and then
144,000 Jewish <b>virgin</b> male servants of God – 12,000 from
each tribe of Israel who are branded on their foreheads with
God’s name and the <b>only</b> people to experience the
mistakenly awaited rapture. The lowest cast will be the gentile
<b>martyrs</b> who died for the sake of Jesus and then a 1000
years later will be join by the rest of the believers in the
Lamb; they too will be <b>branded like cattle with the name of
their owner</b> (Jesus the Lamb). Why are the 144,000 virgin
males more deserving than say Mother Teresa?</p>
<br>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoNormal">All what these various casts
will be doing “<b>forever and ever</b>” is “<b>WORSHIP</b>” god
and the Lamb while singing their praises <b>day and night
FOREVER AND EVER</b>.</p>
<br>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoNormal">By the way, you may be stuck
with an eternal case of claustrophobia in your heavenly final
abode. It only measures 1,500x1,500 miles. Assuming that God
will only grant citizenship to Christians and Jews (even though
they don’t believe in Christ; they are his chosen regardless
Romans 11:11-31). Also, assuming that the end of the world is
going to be a 1000 years from now. Then by my estimates there
will be at least 100 Billion people living in this new city.
This makes it 44,444 people/mile<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<br>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoNormal">Hong Kong, one of the most
densely populated countries in the world, has 15,738 people/mile<sup>2</sup>.
So The Heavenly city is going to be almost THREE TIMES more
crowded than Hong Kong. If you have ever been to Honk Kong or
New York or Los Angeles you would have an appreciation for that.
Thank goodness you won’t have to drive though – Notice that this
allotted space calculation does not take into account the
BEJEWELED GOLDEN THRONES of God and Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoNormal"><b><u>Note:</u></b> If you find
yourself arguing that my estimates are too large and there will
be a lot less people in heaven… reflect on that thought for a
moment… consider what you have just wished for…LESS people in
heaven.</p>
<br>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoNormal">Don’t take my word for all
this. Just read Revelation it is less than 20 pages. You will
get a feel for how EVIL, DRACONIAN and scientifically retarded
this “loving” God of the Bible is. If you are lazy then just
read the following verses. However, you will miss a parade of
terrifyingly horrific accounts of what will happen to people
just because they do not accept Jesus (but the Jews are saved
unconditionally – Romans 11:25-26). Also you will miss all sorts
of amazingly STUPID things like Dragons and Horse-like Locusts
with scorpion stings and creatures that fly in and out of the
belly of Earth and other such infantile retarded and primitive
myths. Anyone who reads Revelation and still considers Yahweh to
be loving, just or good needs to reexamine their ethics and IQ
level.</p>

were dressed in white, and they <b>
<span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">had golden crowns on their

from the throne. Before the throne there were seven lamps
burning, which are the seven Spirits of God. Also before the
throne there was something that looked like a sea of glass, as
clear as crystal. In front of the throne and on each side of it
there were four living beings. They had eyes all over them, in
front and in back. </span></p>
<br>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoNormal"><span style="">The first living

Each of these four living beings had six wings. They were

<span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">Day and night they never
stopped saying</span></b>, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God
All-Powerful. He always was, he is, and he is coming.” These

They worshiped him who lives forever and ever. They put their
crowns down before the throne and said, &nbsp;“ Our Lord and God! You
are worthy to receive glory and honor and power. You made all

<br>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoNormal"><b><u>7:9-17</u></b></p>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoNormal"><span style="">Then I looked,
and there was a <b><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">large
crowd of people</span></b>. There were so many people that no
one could count them all. They were from every nation, tribe,
race of people, and language of the earth. They were standing
before the throne and before the Lamb. They</span></p>
<p style="" class="ecxMsoNormal"><span style="">all wore white
robes and had palm branches in their hands. <b>
<span style="color: rgb(153, 51,

the throne, and to the Lamb.” The elders and the four living
beings were there. All the angels were standing around them and
the throne. The angels bowed down on their faces before the
throne and worshiped God. They said, “Amen! Praise, glory,
wisdom, thanks, honor, power, and strength belong to our God
forever and ever. Amen!” Then one of the elders asked me, “Who
are these people in white robes? Where did they come from?” I
answered, “You know who they are, sir.” And the elder said,
“These are the ones who have come out of the great suffering. <b>
<span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">They have washed their

the throne will protect them. They will never be hungry again.
They will never be thirsty again. The sun will not hurt them. No

their shepherd. He will lead them to springs of water that give
life. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.”</span></p>
