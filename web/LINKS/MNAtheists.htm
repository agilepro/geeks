<p>They are also your neighbors, colleagues and schoolmates. But they remain
largely in the shadows, fearful of intolerance at best, or outright ugliness in
some cases.</p>

<p>Some atheists decided to speak out because atheism has been in the news
recently.</p>

<p>A three-judge panel of the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in June
that requiring children to recite the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools is
unconstitutional because of the words "under God" in it. That ruling
is on hold. The action that resulted in the ruling was brought by a man who
describes himself as an atheist.</p>

<p>And when Gov. Jesse Ventura, who has not named an official day of prayer in
the state, proclaimed July 4 as "Indivisible Day" at the request of
local atheists, it raised eyebrows and ire.</p>

<p>The brouhaha that followed both actions has raised the specter of the late
Madalyn Murray O'Hair, founder and former president of American Atheists Inc.,
whose celebrity status and hateful reputation in the 1960s came to define the
term atheist for some.</p>

<p>"But that's not most of us," said August Berkshire, president of
Minnesota Atheists, a nonprofit educational organization affiliated with
Atheist Alliance International and American Atheists. "We're your friendly
neighborhood atheists."</p>

<p>According to figures from the Graduate Center at City University of New
York, nearly 168 million Americans subscribed to some religion in 2001. Of that
number, nearly 160 million identified themselves as Christians; another 7.7
million identified themselves as other religious groups, including Jewish,
Muslim/Islamic, Buddhist and Unitarian/Universalist. Fourteen percent, or 29.5
million, reported no religious affiliation. Of that number, 900,000 -- just
four-tenths of 1 percent -- identified themselves as atheists.</p>

<p>Here are some local stories.</p>

<p><span class=subhead1><span style='font-family:Arial'>Bill and David </span></span></p>

<p>When Bill, 55, was growing up, "not going to church was equivalent to
killing someone. It was a mortal sin, and you were going to hell." Fearing
reprisals, Bill asked that his last name not be used. </p>

<p>"I kind of decided that as soon as I could think," said Bill, who
has a master's degree. He said that he sees faith as nothing more than
"gullibility. The only absolutely true position on [whether or not God
exists] is to be ignorant," he said.</p>

<p>Bill's 11-year-old son, David, has learned about prejudice firsthand.</p>

<p>"When I was little, at recess I challenged [the story of] Adam and Eve
and the other kids would get really, really mad at me and I'd lose a
friend," he said. Another time in class, while researching a report on
religion, "I said, 'I'm an atheist.' I don't think I should have said
that, but that was the only word I knew." Today, David claims more of the
agnostic view that "I'm really not sure there is a God." After the
classroom revelation, he said, his teacher "stopped noticing me." </p>

<p>Bill said he is raising his son "to have a connection and realize that
other people have feelings. You don't steal, you don't tell lies. You treat
people as you think they want to be treated and have respect for others."</p>

<p><span class=subhead1><span style='font-family:Arial'>Joseph, Dawn and Sarah </span></span></p>

<p>Joseph Homrich, 40, his wife, Dawn Lemke, 38, and their 3-year-old daughter,
Sarah, live in south Minneapolis.</p>

<p>Homrich, who has bachelor degrees in civil engineering and computer science
and a master's degree in civil engineering, and Lemke, a respiratory therapist,
have what you might call a mixed marriage. He is solidly atheist. She embraces
humanism, which upholds an ethical code of living without subscribing to a
deity. </p>

<p>Lemke grew up in a non religious family. "I'm a person who really
doesn't like labels. I'm as devotedly nothing as I can be. I meet people at
face value, without their labels, and get to know them."</p>

<p>Homrich, on the other hand, grew up Catholic, was confirmed at age 11 and
attended a Catholic high school in Grand Rapids, Mich.</p>

<p>"It happened gradually," he said, of his leanings toward atheism.
"I think I was born inclined to skepticism," he said, a trait modeled
after his liberal working-class parents.</p>

<p>"I was helped along by my mother. I'm not sure how she's going to feel
being pointed out as the source of my atheism, but while she paid lip service
to Catholicism, she always held science in high esteem and had a marvelous
ability to dismiss anything that insults her own intelligence."</p>

<p>Homrich recalls questioning his mother about heaven and hell. "She
said, 'Joe, it's just important that you be good. If there is a God, he just
cares that you're good.' "</p>

<p>Still questioning, Homrich became something of a biblical scholar. "It
dawned on me that the stories [in the Bible] were made up by people who lived
back then -- like Greek myths, Mayan myths, no more valid."</p>

<p>Coming to that way of thinking "was having to let go of my
childhood," Homrich said. "Was it difficult? Yes, it was."</p>

<p>Homrich and Lemke say they're not that different from any of their friends
and neighbors, many of whom don't know they're atheists. It just doesn't come
up in conversation, he said. "Nobody discusses theology."</p>

<p>Homrich says he hasn't been treated badly by those who have learned of his
atheism, but he is a little concerned for Sarah. "I've been lucky, but
hey, check back with me in three years when she's in school."</p>

<p><span class=subhead1><span style='font-family:Arial'>Joe, Lisa, Joseph
Michael and Jeff </span></span></p>

<p>Joe and Lisa are a bit embarrassed by what some have come to call
"evangelical" atheists. These are the people, they say, whose
devotion to atheism is almost a religion in itself.</p>

<p>Their own philosophy: Be good citizens and teach your children to be good
citizens, with tolerance for other points of view.</p>

<p>"I just want to make sure people know we're just normal people,"
said Joe, who has a medical practice. "We don't have horns. We're not
monsters. We aren't immoral."</p>

<p>Joe, 37, and Lisa, 36, have three polite sons between the ages of 6 and 10.
"From an outward view of us, I'm sure people would think we're a regular,
churchgoing family. We don't act any differently than anyone else," Joe
said. "But if people found out, there would be such a backlash. Even our
neighbors wouldn't understand."</p>

<p>"They think you're ogres," Lisa said.</p>

<p>A non-practicing Jew, Lisa said that before meeting Joe, she hadn't given
much thought to theology. "I probably would have gone through life not
thinking about it. I think I still have a little more faith than he does,"
she said. "It's more like God is within me, not out in space somewhere.
I'm striving to be a better person."</p>

<p>"I was questioning at 6 or 7," said Joe, who was raised a
Catholic. "I'd be kneeling there, looking up at the priest, wondering,
'Why do you know any more about this mystery than I do?' Religion is how you
relate to your place in the universe. That's how I see it. I'm happy just to
leave it a mystery."</p>

<p>Joe was a teenager before "I had the guts to come forward with
it," he said. "It was a little rough at first, but my parents know
I'm very strong-minded. They don't love me any less."</p>

<p>Eight-year-old Michael says he has learned not to share his beliefs with
friends.</p>

<p>"I don't tell 'em. Once, when I was in kindergarten, I told my friend
and he told the teacher. She said it was OK, but I was embarrassed. He shouted
it to the whole class."</p>

<p>And 10-year-old Joseph got into an argument at school about the existence of
God. "The teacher's aide was very religious, and he felt she had it out
for him all year," Joe said. "Being spiritual doesn't necessarily
mean you're nice -- or ethical.</p>

<p>"If you say you're an atheist, there's a stigma," Joe said.
"As a result, I have so much more of a sensitivity" toward prejudice
endured by minorities. "On the inside, I <i>am </i>a minority."</p>

<p>Joe and Lisa said they hope their boys will examine their own feelings about
religion as they grow, and they will be supportive of whatever decision they
make. "My whole thing is, it's important to think about it," Lisa
said, "regardless of which way you come down on it."</p>

<p><span class=subhead1><span style='font-family:Arial'>What atheists believe </span></span></p>

<p>There is no evidence or reason to believe God exists. Atheism is a positive
lifestyle.</p>

<p><b>Atheists believe in evolution: </b>They believe we are all part of a
closely related, global humanity.</p>

<p><b>Atheists are part of the community: </b>They have friends and families,
participate in society, the arts, sports, politics, education and the economy,
and care about those less fortunate. Atheists often engage in letter writing
and public appearances to try to improve society, and make direct, private
donations to secular charities.</p>

<p><b>Atheists respond </b>to the thought of death by welcoming the challenge
of making their lives meaningful. Atheists believe that after death, they
become an unconscious part of nature. They do not believe in the concepts of
heaven, hell or reincarnation.</p>

<p><b>Evil is incompatible </b>with an all-loving, all-powerful God.</p>
