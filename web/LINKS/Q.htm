proportions if it weren't so tragic."<br>
— Richard Dawkins<p>

— Richard Dawkins, <i>River out of Eden</i><p>

— Richard Dawkins<p>

a-unicornists, but we don't' have to bother saying so."<br>
— Richard Dawkins<p>

"Since all organisms inherit all their genes from their ancestors,
rather than from their ancestors' unsuccessful contemporaries, all
organisms tend to possess successful genes.&nbsp; They have what it takes
to become ancestors — and that means to survive and reproduce.&nbsp; This
is why organisms tend to inherit genes with a propensity to build a
well-designed machine — a body that actively works as if it is
striving to become an ancestor.&nbsp; That is why birds are so good at
flying, fish so good at swimming, monkeys so good at climbing,
viruses so good at spreading.&nbsp; That is why we love life and love sex 
and love children.&nbsp; It is because we all, without a single exception,
inherit all of our genes from an unbroken line of successful
ancestors.&nbsp; The world becomes full of organisms that have what it
takes to become ancestors.&nbsp; That, in a sentence, is Darwinism."<br>
— Richard Dawkins, <i>River out of Eden</i>, page 2<p>

"Another meme of the religious meme complex is called faith.&nbsp; It means
blind trust, in the absence of evidence, even in the teeth of evidence.&nbsp;
The story of Doubting Thomas is told, not so that we shall admire
Thomas, but so that we can admire the other apostles in comparison.&nbsp;
Thomas demanded evidence.&nbsp; Nothing is more lethal for certain kinds of
meme than a tendency to look for evidence.&nbsp; The other apostles, whose
faith was so strong that they did not need evidence, are held up to us
as worthy of imitation.&nbsp; The meme for blind faith secures its own
perpetuation by the simple unconscious expedient of discouraging
rational inquiry."<br>
— Richard Dawkins, <i>The Selfish Gene</i><p>

"The fact that a believer is happier than a skeptic is no more to the point than the
fact that a drunken man is happier than a sober one.&nbsp; The happiness of credulity is a
cheap and dangerous quality."<br>
— George Bernard Shaw<p>

"Because life is there ahead of you and either one tests onself in
its challenges or huddles in the valleys in a dreamless day-to-day
existence whose only purpose is the preservation of an illusory
security and safety."<br>
— Saul Arinsky<p>

"Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge: it is those who know little, and not those

— Charles Darwin<p>

"The world is my country, all mankind are my brethren, and to do good is my religion."<br>
— Thomas Paine<p>

"The study of theology, as it stands in Christian churches, is the study of
nothing; it is founded on nothing; it rests on no principles; it proceeds by
no authorities; it has no data; it can demonstrate nothing; and it admits of
no conclusion."<br>
— Thomas Paine, <i>The Age of Reason</i><p>

"I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church,
by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any
church that I know of.&nbsp; My own mind is my own church."<br>
— Thomas Paine, ibid.<p>

"It is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful
to himself.&nbsp; Infidelity does not consist in believing, or in disbelieving;
it consists in professing to believe what one does not believe.&nbsp; It is
impossible to calculate the moral mischief, if I may so express it, that
mental lying has produced in society.&nbsp; When man has so far corrupted and
prostituted the chastity of his mind, as to subscribe his professional
belief to things he does not believe, he has prepared himself for the
commission of every other crime."<br>
— Thomas Paine, ibid.<p>

"The most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is reason.&nbsp; I have
never used any other, and I trust I never shall."<br>

"I put the following work under your protection.&nbsp; It contains my opinion
upon religion.&nbsp; You will do me the justice to remember, that I have always
strenuously supported the right of every man to his opinion, however different
that opinion might be to mine.&nbsp; He who denies to another this right, makes a slave
of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it."<br>
— Thomas Paine<p>

"Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and tortuous
executions, the unrelenting vindictiveness with which more than half the Bible is filled,
it would be more consistent that we call it the word of a demon than the word of God.&nbsp;
It is a history of wickedness that has served to corrupt and brutalize mankind."<br>
— Thomas Paine<p>

"Fix Reason firmly in her seat, and call to her tribunal every fact, every opinion.&nbsp;
Question with boldness even the existence of a God; because, if there be one, he must
more approve the homage of reason than of blindfolded fear. ... Do not be frightened
from this inquiry by any fear of its consequences.&nbsp; If it end in a belief that there
is no God, you will find incitements to virtue in the comfort and pleasantness you
feel in its exercise and in the love of others which it will procure for you"<br>
— Thomas Jefferson, <i>Jefferson's Works, Vol. II.</i>, p. 217<p>

"Shake off all the fears of servile prejudices, under which weak minds are
servilely crouched.&nbsp; Fix reason firmly in her seat, and call on her tribunal for
every fact, every opinion.&nbsp; Question with boldness even the existence of God;
because, if there be one, he must more approve of the homage of REASON than
that of BLINDFOLDED fear."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson - Letter to nephew Peter Carr, 1787<p>

"The day will come when the mystical generation of Jesus, by the supreme being
as his father in the womb of a virgin, will be classed with the fable of the
generation of Minerva in the brain of Jupiter."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson - Letter to John Adams, 1823<p>

"I have ever judged of the religion of others by their lives…&nbsp; But this does
not satisfy the priesthood.&nbsp; They must have a positive, a declared assent to
all of their interested absurdities.&nbsp; My opinion is that there would never
have been an infidel, if there had never been a priest."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson - Letter to Mrs. M. Harrison Smith, 1816<p>

"History, I believe, furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people maintaining a free
civil government.&nbsp; This marks the lowest grade of ignorance, of which their political
as well as religious leaders will always avail themselves for their own purposes."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson - Letter to Alexander Humboldt, 1813<p>

"Millions of innocent men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity,
have been burnt, tortured, fined, imprisoned; yet we have not advanced one inch towards

— Thomas Jefferson - Notes on the State of Virginia, 1787<p>

themselves...these clergy, in fact, constitute the real Anti-Christ."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson<p>

"I do not find in orthodox Christianity one redeeming feature."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson<p>

"They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve
neither liberty nor safety."<br>
— Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790), from the <i>Historical Review of Pennsylvania</i>, which warns,
 among other things, that if we don't use the Liberty to hold and express our own religious
 opinions, even if out of the fear of reprisal, then we rightly forfeit that Liberty<p>

— Priestley's Autobiography, p. 60, about Benjamin Franklin<p>

"The divinity of Jesus is made a convenient cover for absurdity.&nbsp; Nowhere
in the Gospels do we find a precept for Creeds, Confessions, Oaths,
Doctrines, and whole carloads of other foolish trumpery that we find in
Christianity."<br>
— John Adams<p>

"The question before the human race is, whether the God of nature
shall govern the world by his own laws, or whether priests and kings
shall rule it by fictitious miracles?"<br>
— John Adams, letter to Thomas Jefferson<p>

"As I understand the Christian religion, it was, and is, a revelation.&nbsp;
But how has it happened that millions of fables, tales, legends, have been
blended with both Jewish and Christian revelation that have made them the
most bloody religion that ever existed?"<br>
— John Adams, letter to F.A. Van der Kamp, Dec. 27, 1816<p>

the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved — the Cross.&nbsp;
Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!"<br>
— John Adams, letter to Thomas Jefferson<p>

"What havoc has been made of books through every century of the Christian era?
Where are fifty gospels, condemned as spurious by the bull of Pope Gelasius?
Where are the forty wagon-loads of Hebrew manuscripts burned in France, by
order of another pope, because suspected of heresy?&nbsp; Remember the 'index
expurgatorius', the inquisition, the stake, the axe, the halter and the guillotine."<br>
— John Adams, letter to John Taylor<p>

"The priesthood have, in all ancient nations, nearly monopolized learning.&nbsp;
And ever since the Reformation, when or where has existed a Protestant or
dissenting sect who would tolerate A FREE INQUIRY?&nbsp; The blackest billingsgate,
the most ungentlemanly insolence, the most yahooish brutality, is patiently
endured, countenanced, propagated, and applauded.&nbsp; But touch a solemn truth
in collision with a dogma of a sect, though capable of the clearest proof,
and you will find you have disturbed a nest, and the hornets will swarm
about your eyes and hand, and fly into your face and eyes."<br>
— John Adams, letter to John Taylor<p>

"This is my religion . . . joy and exaltation in my own existence . . . so
go ahead and snarl . . . bite . . . howl, you Calvinistic divines and all
you who say I am no Christian.&nbsp; I say you are not Christian."<br>
— John Adams, <i>Toward the Mystery</i><p>

"Indeed, Mr. Jefferson, what could be invented to debase the ancient
Christianism, which Greeks, Romans, Hebrews and Christian factions, above

after miracles have rolled down in torrents, wave succeeding wave in the
Catholic church, from the Council of Nicea, and long before, to this day."<br>
— John Adams, to Jefferson, 3 December 1813]<p>

"The United States of America have exhibited, perhaps, the first example of
governments erected on the simple principles of nature; and if men are now
sufficiently enlightened to disabuse themselves of artifice, imposture,
hypocrisy, and superstition, they will consider this event as an era in their
history.&nbsp; Although the detail of the formation of the American governments is
at present little known or regarded either in Europe or in America, it may
hereafter become an object of curiosity.&nbsp; It will never be pretended that any
persons employed in that service had interviews with the gods, or were in any
degree under the influence of Heaven, more than those at work upon ships or
houses, or laboring in merchandise or agriculture; it will forever be
acknowledged that these governments were contrived merely by the use of
reason and the senses...."<br>

 United States of America</i> [1787-1788]; from Adrienne Koch, ed.,

"The United States of America governments have exhibited, perhaps, the first example of governments
erected on the simple principles of nature.&nbsp; It will never be pretended that any persons employed in
that service had interviews with the gods, or were in any degree under the influence of Heaven, more
than those at work upon ships or houses, or laboring in merchandise or agriculture; it will forever
be acknowledged that these governments were contrived merely by the use of reason and the senses."<br>
— John Adams<p>

— Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900), <i>The Antichrist</i><p>

"Religion has ever been anti-human, anti-woman, anti-life, anti-peace, anti-reason and

woman take for granted that his or her religious beliefs deserved

views of others when I believe them to be wrong."<br>
— Chapman Cohen, <i>The Creedo of Empowerment</i><p>

If you can tell me what to think, then I can tell you where to go.<br>

the right to worship gods (or not), work on Sunday (or not), and say what we wish
about the various gods.&nbsp; The Constitution, conceived by what may be the most
brilliant and visionary group of men ever assembled, must take precedence over a
book compiled by self-serving peoples of ancient cultures."<br>

— Ernst Mayr, Harvard University, one of the most influential biologists in history<p>

"On the other hand, famous evolutionists such as Dobzhansky were firm believers in a
personal God.&nbsp; He would work as a scientist all week and then on Sunday get down on

would need two totally different compartments in your brain, one that deals with
religion and the other with everything else."<br>
— Ernst Mayr<p>

"What the mind doesn't understand, it worships or fears."<br>

Mencken's Creed<br>
<li>I believe that religion, generally speaking, has been a curse to mankind - that its modest and greatly
overestimated services on the ethical side have been more than overcome by the damage it has done to
clear and honest thinking.<br>
<li>I believe that no discovery of fact, however trivial, can be wholly useless to the race, and that no
trumpeting of falsehood, however virtuous in intent, can be anything but vicious.<br>
<li>I believe that all government is evil, in that all government must necessarily make war upon liberty...<br>
<li>I believe that the evidence for immortality is no better than the evidence of witches, and deserves no more respect.<br>
<li>I believe in the complete freedom of thought and speech...<br>
<li>I believe in the capacity of man to conquer his world, and to find out what it is made of, and how it is run.<br>
<li>I believe in the reality of progress.<br>
<li>But the whole thing, after all, may be put very simply.&nbsp; I believe that it is better to tell the truth than
to lie.<br>
<li>I believe that it is better to be free than to be a slave.&nbsp; And I believe that it is better to know than
be ignorant.<p>

"People who oppose evolution, and seek to have creationism or intelligent design included in science
curricula, seek to dismiss and change the most successful way of knowing ever discovered.&nbsp; They wish
to substitute opinion and belief for evidence and testing.&nbsp; The proponents of creationism/intelligent
design promote scientific ignorance in the guise of learning.&nbsp; As professional scientists and
educators, we strongly assert that such efforts are both misguided and flawed, presenting an
incorrect view of science, its understandings, and its processes."<br>
— Botanical Society of America<p>

"There is nothing wrong with challenging conventional wisdom — continuing challenge is a core
feature of science.&nbsp; But challengers should at least be aware of, read, cite, and specifically 
rebut the actual data that supports conventional wisdom, not merely construct a rhetorical
edifice out of omission of relevant facts, selective quoting, bad analogies, knocking down
strawmen, and tendentious interpretations.&nbsp; Unless and until the 'intelligent design' movement
does this, they are not seriously in the game.&nbsp; They're not even playing the same sport."<br>
— <a href=http://www.pandasthumb.org/>The Panda's Thumb</a><p>

"The Bible identifies 15 crimes against the family worthy of the death penalty.&nbsp;
ABORTION is treason against the family and deserves the DEATH PENALTY.<br>
ADULTERY is treason to the family; adulterers should be put to DEATH.<br>
HOMOSEXUALTIY is treason to the family, and it too, is worthy of DEATH."<br>
— R.J. Rushdoony, to Bill Moyers on television.&nbsp; From a PBS Home Video: <i>God and Politics:
On Earth as it is in Heaven</i>, 1988.<p>

R.J. Rushdoony hasn't read his bible much.&nbsp; God may oppose abortion but he doesn't
seem to mind killing of children:
Numbers 31:2-17, Deuteronomy 2:34, Deuteronomy 3:3 - 6, Joshua 5:21, 1Samuel 15:3, etc, etc.<p>

Concerning adultery, many of the bible's heroes committed it with God's blessing:
Genesis 38:8-10, Hosea 1:2, 2 Samuel 11:4
(David was punished for this one but not the death penalty as Rushdoony suggested), to list a few.<p>

But concerning the death penalty, there's the following problem:
Genesis 9:6 "Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed,
for in the image of God has God made man."
Sounds like a bit of a contradiction with all those OT laws.<p>

"God himself shows little respect for what is best in the Bible.&nbsp; He commands 'Thou shalt not kill',
and then promptly orders the killing of many thousands.&nbsp; Moses condemns human sacrifice but God
demands the sacrifice of Isaac and accepts that of Jephthah's daughter.&nbsp; Jesus preaches 'whoever
shall say 'you fool!', shall be in danger of hell fire', but shortly after this rages at the
pharisees saying 'you fools!'."<br>
— Prof Carl Lofmark, <i>What is the Bible?</i><p>

"The theist must present an intelligible description of god.&nbsp; Until he does so, god makes no more sense
than unie; both are cognitively empty, and any attempt at proof is logically absurd."<br>
— George H. Smith, <i>Atheism: The Case Against God</i><p>

"The belief in eternal torment, still subscribed to by fundamentalist Christian denominations,
undoubtedly ranks as the most vicious and reprehensible doctrine of classical Christianity.&nbsp;
It has resulted in an incalculable amount of psychological torture, especially among children
where it is employed as a terror tactic to prompt obedience."<br>
— George H. Smith, ibid.<p>

"It cannot be emphasised too strongly that Christianity has a vested interest in human misery.&nbsp;
Christianity, perhaps more than any religion before or since, capitalized on human suffering; and it
was enormously successful in insuring its own existence through the perpetuation of human suffering."<br>
— George H. Smith, ibid.<p>

"Just as Christianity must destroy reason before it can introduce faith, so it must destroy happiness
before it can introduce salvation."<br>
— George H. Smith, ibid.<p>

"Reason is not one tool of thought among many, it is the entire toolbox.&nbsp;
To advocate that reason be discarded in some circumstances is to
advocate that thinking be discarded - which leaves one in the position of
attempting to do a job after throwing away the required instrument."<br>
— George H. Smith, ibid.<p>

"I am arguing that faith as such, faith as an alleged method of aquiring
knowledge, is totally invalid and as a consequence, all propositions of
faith, because they lack rational demonstration, must conflict with reason."<br>

"Jesus, in fact, was typical of a certain kind of fanatical young idealist: at one moment
holding forth with tears in his eyes about the need for universal love; at the next,
furiously denouncing the morons, crooks and bigots who do not see eye to eye with him.&nbsp;
It is very natural and very human behaviour.&nbsp; But it is not supernatural.&nbsp; Many of the
great men in history (for example Socrates and Gandhi) have met criticism with more
dignity and restraint."<br>
— Margaret Knight, Lecturer on Psychology, Aberdeen University<p>

"This hideous doctrine of eternal torment after death has probably caused more terror and
misery, more cruelty and more violation of natural human sympathy, than any belief in the
history of mankind.&nbsp; Yet this doctrine was taught unambiguously by Jesus."<br>
— Margaret Knight<p>

"There is no justification for the common claim that Christianity was responsible for the
abolition of slavery.&nbsp; The Negro slave trade – a far more infamous practice than slavery in the
ancient world – was initiated, carried on and defended by Christian men in Christian countries."<br>
— Margaret Knight<p>

"The dominant Catholic Church jumped through legalistic hoops to make slavery not only acceptable
but justifiable as a way of spreading the faith.&nbsp; Indeed, slave owners were obliged by law to
baptise their slaves."<br>
— Phil Grabsky, writer – <i>An Inconvenient History</i>, BBC<p>

"It is a terrible commentary on Christian civilisation that the longest
period of slave-raiding known to history was initiated by the action of
Spain, Portugal, France, Holland and Britain, after the Christian faith
had for more than a thousand years been the established religion of Europe."<br>
— H.A.L. Fisher, <i>History of Europe</i><p>

"Let's not forget that the first holocaust took place not in the concentration
camps of Nazi Germany, or Poland, but on the cotton fields of Christian America,
the gold mines of Catholic Brazil, and the sugar plantations of the Carribbean.&nbsp;
One and a half million negroes died in transit from their homeland.&nbsp; We don't
know how many were worked, whipped, tortured, hanged or beaten to death but
the ultimate toll was considerably greater than the combined toll in Auswitz,
Belsen and the like.&nbsp; We're talking about the Christian holocaust."<br>

"The so-called Christian nations are the most enlightened and progressive ... but in
spite of their religion, not because of it.&nbsp; The Church has opposed every innovation and
discovery from the day of Galileo down to our own time, when the use of anesthetic in
childbirth was regarded as a sin because it avoided the biblical curse pronounced against
Eve.&nbsp; And every step in astronomy and geology ever taken has been opposed by bigotry and

Where there is evidence, no one speaks of "faith."&nbsp; We do not speak of faith that two

substitute emotion for evidence.&nbsp; The substitution of emotion for evidence is apt to
lead to strife, since different groups, substitute different emotions."<br>

"I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his

"Being a conservative in America traditionally has meant that one
holds a deep, abiding respect for the Constitution.&nbsp; We conservatives
believe sincerely in the integrity of the Constitution.&nbsp; We treasure
the freedom that document protects.... By maintaining the separation of church and state, the United States
has avoided the intolerance, which has so divided the rest of the
world with religious wars.&nbsp; Throughout our two hundred plus years,
public policy debate has focused on political and economic issues, on
which there can be compromise....&nbsp; The great decisions of government
cannot be dictated by the concerns of religious factions.&nbsp; This was
true in the days of Madison, and it is just as tue today.&nbsp; We have
succeeded for 205 years in keeping the affairs of state separate from
the uncompromising idealism of religious groups and we mustn't stop

our government is not founded upon the rights of gods, but upon the
rights of men.&nbsp; Our Constitution was framed, not to declare and uphold
the deity of Christ, but the sacredness of humanity.&nbsp; Ours is the
first government made by the people and for the people.&nbsp; It is the

The walls of my prison crumbled and fell.&nbsp; The dungeon was flooded with
light and all the bolts and bars and manacles became dust.&nbsp; I was no
longer a servant, a serf, or a slave.&nbsp; There was for me no master in all

to express my thoughts—free to live my own ideal, free to live for myself

"Believing that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and
his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his
worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only,
and not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of
the whole American people which declared that their Legislature
should "make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof," thus building a wall of
separation between Church and State."<br>
— Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826), 3rd U.S. President (1801-1809), letter to Danbury Baptists, 1802<p>

"If you must believe in anything, believe in yourselves, in your senses, in

in brains go out"<br>

"Atheism leaves a man to sense, to philosophy, to natural piety, to laws,
to reputation; all of which may be guides to an outward moral virtue, even

"Today, almost half a century after the publication of the Encyclical
[of Pius IX], new knowledge has led to the recognition in the theory
of evolution of more than a hypothesis.&nbsp; It is indeed remarkable that
this theory has been progressively accepted by researchers, following
a series of discoveries in various fields of knowledge.&nbsp; The
convergence, neither sought nor fabricated, of the results of work
that was conducted independently is in itself a significant argument
in favor of this theory."<br>
— Pope John Paul II Roman Catholic Pontiff,
revising Pius IX's Encyclical and substantially updating the Church's<br>
position on the teaching of evolution in an Address to the Pontifical<br>

"In India, as elsewhere in our darkening world, religion is the poison
in the blood.&nbsp; Where religion intervenes, mere innocence is no excuse.&nbsp;
Yet we go on skating around this issue, speaking of religion in the
fashionable language of 'respect.'&nbsp; What is there to respect in any of
this, or in any of the crimes now being committed almost daily around
the world in religion's dreaded name?"<br>
— Salman Rushdie, author<p>

"When you once attribute effects to the will of a personal God, you
have let in a lot of little gods and evils — then sprites, fairies, 
dryads, naiads, witches, ghosts and goblins, for your imagination is
reeling, riotous, drunk, afloat on the flotsam of superstition.&nbsp; What
you know then doesn't count.&nbsp; You just believe, and the more your
believe the more do you plume yourself that fear and faith are superior
to science and seeing."<br>
— Elbert Hubbard, lecturer, author, printer<p>

"The lessons of the First Amendment are as urgent in the modern world
as the 18th Century when it was written.&nbsp; One timeless lesson is that
if citizens are subjected to state-sponsored religious exercises, the
State disavows its own duty to guard and respect that sphere of
inviolable conscience and belief which is the mark of a free people."<br>
— Anthony M. Kennedy (b. 1936) Supreme Court Justice, appointed by Reagan,

 from Albert J. Menendez and Edd Doerr, <i>The Great Quotations on Religious Freedom</i><p>

"I believe in an America that is officially neither Catholic, Protestant nor
Jewish - where no public official either requests or accepts instructions on
public policy from the pope, the National Council of Churches or any other
ecclesiastical source — where no religious body seeks to impose its will
directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of its
officials."<br>
— John F. Kennedy, address to the Ministerial Association of Greater Houston, September 12, 1960<p>

"I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is
absolute — where no Catholic prelate would tell the president (should he be
Catholic) how to act, and no Protestant minister would tell his parishioners
for whom to vote — where no church or church school is granted any public
funds or political preference — and where no man is denied public office
merely because his religion differs from the president who might appoint him
or the people who might elect him.<br>
— John F. Kennedy<p>

"I can't take my Catholic belief, my article of faith, and legislate it on a Protestant or a Jew
or an Atheist.&nbsp; We have separation of church and state in the United States of America."<br>

"I have something to say to the religionist who feels atheists never say
anything positive: You are an intelligent human being.&nbsp; Your life is valuable
for its own sake.&nbsp; You are not second-class in the universe, deriving meaning
and purpose from some other mind.&nbsp; You are not inherently evil — you are
inherently human, possessing the positive rational potential to help make
this a world of morality, peace and joy.&nbsp; Trust yourself"<br>
— Dan Barker in <i>Losing Faith in Faith: From Preacher to Atheist</i><p>

"For though a man should be a complete unbeliever in the being of
gods; if he also has a native uprightness of temper, such persons
will detest evil in men; their repugnance to wrong disinclines them
to commit wrongful acts; they shun the unrighteous and are drawn to the upright."<br>

Doerr, <i>The Great Quotations on Religious Freedom</i><p>

"The Founding Fathers were neither passive, death-worshiping mystics
nor mindless, power-seeking looters; as a political group, they were
a phenomenon unprecedented in history: they were thinkers who were
also men of action.&nbsp; They had rejected the soul-body dichotomy, with
its two corollaries: the impotence of man's mind and the damnation of
this earth; they had rejected the doctrine of suffering as man's
metaphysical fate, they proclaimed man's right to the pursuit of
happiness and were determined to establish on earth the conditions
required for man's proper existence, by the 'unaided' power of their intellect."<br>
— Ayn Rand (1905-1982) American novelist and philosopher <i>For the New Intellectual</i><p>

"I don't think any religion makes any sense and I think people who are
into that are really getting duped, and I don't think Judaism makes
any more sense than Christianity, and I don't think Christianity
makes any more sense than Scientology.&nbsp; But here's a guy, L. Ron
Hubbard, who told all his friends, 'Look, I'm gonna start a
religion, 'cause I can't make any money as a science fiction writer.'&nbsp;
I mean, he admitted that publicly!&nbsp; At least with Jesus Christ,
you can't go talk to the guy."<br>

presidency, <i>Breaking the Last Taboo</i> (1996), from James A. Haught<p>

"We have gone a long way toward civilization and religious tolerance,
and we have a good example in this country.&nbsp; Here the many Protestant
denominations, the Catholic Church and the Greek Orthodox Church do
not seek to destroy one another in physical violence just because
they do not interpret every verse of the Bible in exactly the same
way.&nbsp; Here we now have the freedom of all religions, and I hope that
never again will we have a repetition of religious bigotry, as we
have had in certain periods of our own history.&nbsp; There is no room for
that kind of foolishness here."<br>
— Harry Truman, 33rd U.S. President (1945-1953) quoted in
<i>The Great Quotations on Religious Freedom</i><p>

"So I'm sorry, I don't respect people who believe in religion.&nbsp; I was religious when
I was a kid.&nbsp; We all had dumb stuff drilled into our head.&nbsp; It doesn't mean when you
get to be an adult you can't drill it out.&nbsp; I tell you something else they drilled
into my head when I was a kid, mercury in my cavities.&nbsp; We found out later mercury
is so bad we shouldn't even eat it when there is a trace of it in fish.&nbsp; But it was
drilled into my teeth.&nbsp; So when I got older, I had it drilled out.&nbsp; You can do the
same thing with religion.&nbsp; To talk about this terrorism situation without talking
about religion is like talking about AIDS in America without talking about
homosexuality.&nbsp; You can do it; it will get you applause on Oprah; but it's not true."<br>

"There is no evidence for a god, no coherent definition of a god, no good argument for a god, good

and we can do it better."<br>
