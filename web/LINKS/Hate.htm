<h1>Hate, American Style</h1>
August 30, 2002<br>
By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF<p>

<p>EAST PEORIA, Ill. - My interview with the Rev. Matt Hale,
America's scariest hatemonger, got off to a rocky start.

<p>As he picked at a fruit salad in a restaurant here in East
Peoria, his headquarters, he recalled an incident in
childhood that first led him to regard nonwhites as vermin:
At a dance, he saw white girls "betraying their race" by
kissing black boys.

<p>"I felt nauseous," he said solemnly. "Interracial marriage
is against nature. It's a form of bestiality."

<p>A moment later, I disclosed that I had betrayed the white
race and married a Chinese-American. It was, I felt, an
awkward moment.

<p>But Mr. Hale, as charming and charismatic as he is hateful,
was unfazed. He beamed, and for a moment I thought he was
going to ask to see photos of my kids.

<p>I came to East Peoria to meet Mr. Hale because he has
become the key figure in America's hate community,
revitalizing racism by recruiting women, children and
convicts into a high-tech, energetic organization whose
followers show a pattern of random brutality toward blacks
and other "enemies." It would be flattering Mr. Hale too
much to call his group America's Al Qaeda, but the scary
thing is that I think the comparison would leave him
feeling flattered.

<p>After 9/11 I interviewed Muslim hatemongers abroad, and I
wanted to confront our own religious extremists. They are
not a threat to national stability, the way they are in
Pakistan or Saudi Arabia, but they are every bit as loony
as Al Qaeda and they have been enmeshed in violence. That's
particularly true of Mr. Hale's group, the World Church of
the Creator, whose followers have shot, knifed or beaten
blacks, Jews and Asian-Americans in several states.

<p>Mr. Hale dismisses the attacks as understandable but
anomalous. He says that while killing enemies (presumably
including race-betrayers like me) is morally justifiable,
for now it is tactically inappropriate and doesn't
accomplish much, anyway.

<p>"Suppose someone goes out and kills 10 blacks tonight," he
shrugs impatiently. "Well, there are millions more."

<p>A law school graduate, Mr. Hale, 31, has built the World
Church of the Creator into an international organization
with members in 49 states and 28 countries. It claims
70,000 to 80,000 adherents and boasts in press releases
that it is "the fastest-growing white racist and
anti-Semitic church in America."

<p>Yet it is not a religion in any traditional sense, and its
sole theology is "RaHoWa" - racial holy war on behalf of
whites. It recruits very energetically, distributing 80,000
leaflets just this spring, and runs a sophisticated Web
site with information on, for example, how to make your own
plastic explosives. The church even has a Web page for
kids.

<p>There are plenty of other domestic counterparts to Islam's
manic mullahs. Think of Christian Reconstructionists, who
want to re-establish Old Testament laws, even stoning to
death adulterers and heretics. (We tend to forget that
stoning to death is never mentioned in the Koran but is
frequently prescribed in the Bible; a rigid interpretation
of Deuteronomy would lead to the execution of most
Americans.)

<p>Mr. Hale's World Church is scariest of all, though, because
of its vigor and highbrow racism. One of the church's
slogans, an ungrammatical twist on Cato the Elder's famous
line about Carthage, is even in Latin: "Delenda est
Judaica," which could be translated as "Judaism must be
destroyed."

<p>The son of a policeman, Mr. Hale had his awakening when he
was 12 years old and read both "The Rise and Fall of the
Third Reich" and "Mein Kampf." ( So much for the benefits
of early reading programs.) He marries his intelligence
with attitudes that make your skin crawl.

<p>After the reporter Daniel Pearl was murdered, Mr. Hale
wrote: "We couldn't care less about the death of this Jew
who along with the rest of his parasitic race are clearly a
form of vermin far more dangerous in fact than the kind
that run on four legs."

<p>Mr. Hale also boasted to me: "We have really revolutionized
the whole racial community. People used to think of a guy
with a beer belly, spitting out tobacco and missing a few
teeth. Now they think of people who are determined,
energetic leaders, educated and idealistic. We're the
best."

<p>As Al Qaeda has shown us, the only people more dangerous
than dumb bigots are smart, educated ones.<p>
