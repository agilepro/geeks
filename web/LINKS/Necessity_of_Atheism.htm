<h1 align=center>The Necessity of Atheism</h1>
<h2 align=center><i>Why not to believe</i></h2>
<p>Although there are many other excellent sites on the Internet that supply
reasons to be an atheist, there are none, so far as I know, that attempt to
gather all these reasons into one place. This essay seeks to remedy that
oversight. It represents an attempt at providing a general defense and
justification of atheism, listing the valid reasons both major and minor to be a
nonbeliever. Although each individual item on the list will not attempt to
comprehensively expound on the specific reason or argument it outlines, it
should at least give an overview of that reason, and greater detail will be
provided by links to other articles where applicable.
<p>This essay will make the case for atheism in three sections. The first
section consists of evidential reasons: factual statements about the world that
under any reasonable interpretation make atheism more likely to be true than
theism. Some of these facts strengthen the case against theism in general, while
others are relevant to particular belief systems. However, even the facts that
only constitute evidence against some religions make atheism more likely to be
true, because when one alternative is removed from consideration, it must
increase the likelihood of all the remaining possibilities, of which atheism is
one.
<p>For purposes of deciding what constitutes evidence, this essay will employ a
"surprisingness" criterion: a given observation is evidence for a hypothesis if
that observation is unsurprising - i.e., expected - assuming that hypothesis is
true; and an observation is evidence against a hypothesis if that observation
would be surprising and unexpected assuming that hypothesis is true. For
example, if I leave a bowl of milk out in the kitchen at night and return in the
morning to find the milk gone and the kitchen swept and scrubbed, this
observation is not surprising under the hypothesis that my house is inhabited by
fairies who do housework in exchange for food. On the other hand, such an
observation <i>would</i> be surprising under the hypothesis that there are no
such fairies, and so constitutes evidence for the former over the latter.
<p>The second section of this essay consists of moral reasons for atheism: cases
where the requirement to do what is right favors being an atheist, or at the
very least, not supporting certain sects or practices of theism. If one believes
(as I do) that morality is objective and that certain acts are right or wrong
and will be right or wrong regardless of what anyone says, it therefore follows
that we are morally obligated to reject any religious belief system that
advocates or practices such wrong acts. Granted, rejecting a particular religion
as immoral does not establish the truth of atheism. However, even if a
religion's claims about the world were factually true, if it commanded evil
actions we would still be obligated to reject it; and those who cannot accept
the notion of an evil god must conclude that any immoral religion is necessarily
false. In any case, this essay will attempt to show that there are some moral
shortcomings common to all religions.
<p>The final section of this essay consists of practical reasons for atheism:
reasons why accepting atheism over theism produces positive overall effects on a
person's life. While these do not in themselves provide reasons to think that
atheism is true, if one is already convinced by the evidential and moral
arguments in favor of atheism, they provide additional incentive to adopt it and
make it one's chosen worldview.
<p><a name="evidential"></a><b>Evidential Reasons</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li><i>Religions demand faith and discourage attempts to verify
their claims through test and experiment, and this fact is less
surprising under atheism than theism.</i><br>
Rarely, if ever, do religious evangelists win converts by
presenting the evidence for their faith in a rational manner.
Instead, they largely appeal to emotion and the bandwagon,
encouraging others to join their belief system because it feels
good to do so, regardless of whether it is supported by the
facts. New members are then taught to maintain their belief not
through continual testing, but through faith, which can be
defined as belief in a proposition without sufficient justifying
evidence. Indeed, not only are believers not encouraged to test
their faith, but they are generally taught that it is outright
<i>wrong</i> to do so - that it is a sin to carry out an
experiment whose results would enable them to distinguish
whether their belief was true or untrue. Such activities are
generally grouped under the label "putting God to the test", and
most holy books carry stern warnings against attempting it. Some
religions go even further by commanding their followers not to
read arguments critical of the faith or have any contact with
people who were once members but have since left the church.
(For more on these and similar tactics, see "<a href="http://www.ebonmusings.org/atheism/thoughts.html">Thoughts
in Captivity</a>").
<p>If a particular religion was true, this is not what we would
expect. On the contrary, a belief that was true would obviously
pass any test it was subjected to, and therefore would have
every reason to welcome people to test it so that they could see
this for themselves. A belief that was true could be defended
purely by recourse to the facts, without demanding its adherents
believe in something of which they have no experience. A belief
that was true would not need to fear its followers investigating
opposing viewpoints for themselves. On the other hand, a belief
system that was false, in order to protect itself, would most
likely want to discourage its followers from doing things that
would lead to them finding that out. Therefore, the
anti-empirical attitude of most religions is less surprising
under atheism than theism, and thus gives us reason to believe
that atheism is more likely to be correct.
<p>

<li><i>Science is a very effective means of gaining knowledge
whereas revelation and scriptural study is not, and this fact is
less surprising under atheism than theism.</i><br>
Throughout human history, people have believed a great many
ideas that in retrospect turned out to be wrong. However, what
is most striking is the source of many of these incorrect ideas:
with few exceptions, they ultimately emanated from religious
scripture. The geocentric theory of the solar system; the
Noachian deluge as an explanation for the geological record; the
age of the Earth estimated as 6000 years old; the separate
ancestry and simultaneous appearance of all species; the belief
in epidemic diseases as caused by human sin rather than poor
hygiene; the intellectual inferiority of non-European races; all
these and many more mistaken ideas trace their origins to
religious beliefs arrived at through faith without testing (see
the previous item). There is not one single fact about the world
that has been proven true in the long run and that is both
non-trivial and non-obvious for which we ultimately owe credit
to religious scripture rather than painstaking empirical
examination.
<p>Of course, this is not to say that people following the
scientific method have not made mistakes as well. Science is
primarily a way of studying the world, not an infallible oracle
for gaining knowledge. However, science's self-correcting nature
enables us to discover these mistakes and fix them, whereas the
nature of religious dogma offers no comparable way to correct
errors. The result is that all the major advances in our
knowledge over the past few hundred years are owed primarily to
scientific study of the world; on the other hand, beliefs which
were first arrived at through mysticism or faith almost always
turn out to be wrong.
<p>If any particular religion were true, this is not what we
would expect. The effectiveness of science can be explained
regardless of whether there is a god or not. However, if there
was a being that had a role in creating the natural laws of the
universe, and if some religious belief system was an effective
way to contact and communicate with that being, it is reasonable
to expect that revelation, either through written texts or
personal experience, might occasionally provide genuinely new
knowledge. But this does not happen. This fact is far less
surprising under the assumption of atheism than under the
assumption of theism.
<p>

<li><i>Many religions attempt to suppress outside examination
and criticism, and this fact is less surprising under atheism
than theism.</i><br>
Not only do most religions command their own followers not to
put their beliefs to the test, many have gone further in taking
action even against outsiders who attempt to critically
investigate or speak out against them. The medieval European
inquisitions that attempted to crush other faiths and silence
scientists whose findings ran contrary to church dogma are the
most obvious example, but there are many others as well: for
example, many Muslim countries today are repressive theocracies
where censorship is pervasive and sentences of exile and death
are routinely issued against authors whose works are deemed to
be blasphemous against Islam. Even in the United States of
America, the deluge of threats of impeachment, boycott and even
physical harm that instantly and predictably springs up in
response to any opinion that is perceived to differ from the
prevailing dogma has resulted in few if any nonbelievers being
given a platform by major public institutions. Evidently, there
are a vast number of religious believers who see nothing wrong
with silencing speech whose content they disagree with.
<p>As in the first example from this essay, this is to be
expected if atheism is true. The church establishments that have
accumulated vast amounts of money, power and influence have a
vested interest in protecting those assets, and if their beliefs
are not in fact true and cannot withstand criticism and
investigation, it is to be expected that they would attempt to
stifle such criticism if they feel it may be a serious threat.
On the other hand, any belief system that is true should have
nothing to fear from even the most searching outside
examination, and should welcome scrutiny accordingly. This would
be doubly true if there did in fact exist a god who would ensure
his chosen people triumphed over all adversity. If God is truly
on their side, what are so many faiths so afraid of?
<p>

<li><i>Many religions have histories of intolerance and
violence, and this fact is less surprising under atheism than
theism.</i><br>
Throughout history, religion has been used as a justification
for countless crimes against humanity. Some of the most readily
recalled examples include the medieval Crusades that pitted
Christians against Muslims in bloody combat; the witch hunts
that led to the torture and unjust execution of thousands of
innocents; the Holocaust (Nazi soldiers wore belt buckles that
said "God With Us"); the ongoing acts of terrorism waged by
Muslim fundamentalists; the creation of tyrannical divine-right
monarchies and theocratic regimes throughout Europe, Asia and
Africa; the long-enduring oppression and unequal treatment of
women; and the trans-Atlantic slave trade that persisted for
centuries, whose painful legacy of racism and bigotry persists
to some extent even today. Although religions usually plead for
tolerance and freedom of conscience when in the minority, given
the chance those same religions often attempt to gain civil
power, force the public to support them and oppress or wage war
on other faiths.
<p>This pattern is far less surprising under atheism than
theism. Religious apologists will usually claim that the actions
of sinful humans are not evidence against the existence of God,
but an atheist can reply that if there was such a being, we
would have every right to expect him to prevent such things, or
at least clearly show that they were in contradiction to his
will. But neither has happened. Nor does belief in any
particular religion seem to improve human beings' sense of
morality enough to keep them from committing such atrocities. If
religions are composed solely of human beings, lacking divine
moral guidance, this is to be expected.
<p>

<li><i>Many religions have cruel or morally unacceptable
doctrines, and this fact is less surprising under atheism than
theism.</i><br>
The vast majority of religions postulate that the power that
created the universe is benevolent and good, morally worthy of
humans' worship and devotion. In light of this, it is surprising
that almost all of these religions also claim that this power
has on various occasions commanded, condoned, or directly caused
acts of terrible cruelty, violence, and evil. Foremost among
these is the doctrine of Hell, which states that those who fail
to worship the creator as he commands will, upon their death, be
cast into a realm of agonizing, never-ending suffering. This
idea is a vicious and evil absurdity, particularly because it is
so often claimed that a merciful and loving god created such a
place and desires to send some people there. (See "<a href="http://www.ebonmusings.org/atheism/infinitepunishment.html">Infinite
Punishment for Finite Sins</a>" for more on the idea of Hell.)
However, this is not by any means the only morally unacceptable
doctrine put forth by some religions. As another example, many
holy books contain approving records of past genocidal wars
waged by the self-proclaimed chosen people against their
enemies. Many others set cruel and disproportionate punishments
for the most trifling crimes, or acts that are not crimes at
all. For several examples of this pattern from the Bible, see "<a href="http://www.ebonmusings.org/atheism/atrocities.html">A
Book of Blood</a>".
<p>If these religions truly were inspired by a morally good
deity, it is bizarre that they contain so many stories approving
of bloodshed, violence and torture. Such an outcome is too
implausible to believe. On the other hand, if these books were
written by human beings alone, in an era where humanity's
understanding of morality was still primitive and poorly
developed, it is not surprising at all that they contain verses
that we today understand to be completely unacceptable.
<p>

<li><i>Religious societies reflect the prejudices of their time,
and this fact is less surprising under atheism than theism.</i><br>
If a religion was inspired by a consistent and unchanging god
not limited by what human beings believed at any particular
time, it is reasonable to expect that that religion would not
merely mirror the changing beliefs of the cultures it passed
down through, but would stay essentially the same through time.
However, this is not what we find.
<p>For example, take slavery. Today, this practice is widely
recognized as immoral and universally condemned by Western
nations of the Judeo-Christian tradition. However, the Jewish
and Christian scriptures, which were written in a milieu where
slavery was common, do not condemn it, but rather accept it and
even work it into their teachings as though it were the most
normal thing in the world; and for many centuries the societies
that relied on these scriptures accepted it without question.
However, with the rise of the abolition movement, these
religions' beliefs on the morality of slavery underwent a huge
and dramatic shift. Similar reversals have occurred throughout
history in many religions regarding many different issues.
<p>This is not to say that no churches or religious individuals
have ever been at the forefront of movements for social change.
But rather than being a unanimous voice for moral progress,
religious groups often sustain immoral practices for decades or
centuries until the push for reform begins, and even then tend
to be deeply split by such disputes. This is what we should
expect assuming atheism is true.
<p>
<li><i>There is a vast amount of religious confusion and
disagreement between many different belief systems, and this
fact is less surprising under atheism than theism.</i><br>
Among human cultures both past and present, there is an enormous
number of different and incompatible religions. Virtually every
society from every era and every region of the planet has had
its own pantheons of deities, its own mythologies about the
origin of the world and humanity, its own set of rules for how
the gods expect us to behave, and its own views about the nature
of the afterlife and the fate of the universe. While some of
these belief systems bear some resemblance to each other, in
general their similarities are far outweighed by their profound
differences; and the further separated by time and space they
are, the more different they tend to be. Apologists for these
various belief systems have been arguing over which is the
correct one for millennia, and yet the dispute is not nearing
resolution; there is no end in sight. If anything, many of these
belief systems are drawing further and further away from each
other rather than nearing a point of unification.
<p>If atheism is correct, this is to be expected - if religions
spring from human creativity and imagination rather than a
common wellspring of revelation, it is hardly surprising that
people from a diverse variety of different cultures, times and
places have created many different ones. It would be
extraordinarily unlikely for many different people who had no
contact with each other to independently invent the exact same
belief set. On the other hand, if there is a god, it is strange
and unexpected that there would be so much religious confusion
among humanity. Why would God, if such a being exists, not
dispense his message to all people equally? For more on this
argument, see "<a href="http://www.ebonmusings.org/atheism/shellgame.html">The
Cosmic Shell Game</a>".
<p>
<li><i>Religions are fragmented into sects that cannot agree on
key issues of doctrine or ethics, and this fact is less
surprising under atheism than theism.</i><br>
Continuing the previous point, even within any particular belief
system where all the members agree on the same basic theological
principles and teachings, there is a vast diversity of opinion
on how to interpret those teachings. The spectrum of
interpretations within any given religion runs from extreme
liberal to extreme conservative, from figurative to literal,
from wide-open ecumenicalism to ardent fundamentalism. As above,
the debates between the various points of view within a given
religion have in most cases been going on since that religion
existed, with the same arguments repeated endlessly by both
sides, and with no resolution in sight. Though all participants
in such a debate usually agree that they want to follow God's
will and are continually asking him to reveal to them what that
will is, they are rarely if ever able to reach agreement.
<p>This is expected under atheism. If there is no supernatural
deity that reliably informs seekers of what was actually meant
by a given teaching, it is no surprise that different people
cannot agree on what those meanings are, nor is it surprising
that these unresolvable arguments continue to lead to the
fragmentation of existing religions and the formation of new
sects. On the other hand, if there is a god that guides his
followers, it is unexpected that this process would be allowed
to continue. Why would God not clearly inform all believers what
a disputed verse was intended to mean, particularly if holding a
correct interpretation of that verse was a requirement for
salvation?
<p>
<li><i>Religions emerge in isolated areas and only then spread
in space and time, rather than appearing in every society at
once, and this fact is less surprising under atheism than
theism.</i><br>
Given that all human beings are fundamentally the same at the
genetic and cognitive levels, it follows as a consequence that
any god that desired to communicate with us would probably
desire to communicate with <i>all</i> of us. Likewise, given the
inherent unfairness of God's directly speaking to only some
people and leaving others nothing but indirect and second-hand
evidence, especially if there is a penalty for nonbelief, it is
to be expected that a religion truly founded by divine
revelation would appear in every culture at once. There is no
reason to expect God to play favorites.
<p>But of course, this is not what we find, and that is to be
expected if atheism is true. Instead, we find religions that
emerge in specific places at specific times, often with specific
"chosen" nations or ethnicities, and that only gradually spread
via human evangelism. To postulate that any particular religion
is true means that millions of people throughout thousands of
years of Earth's history lived and died without ever hearing of
it. For more on this topic, see "<a href="http://www.ebonmusings.org/atheism/locality.html">The
Argument from Locality</a>".
<p>

<li><i>The mind has a physical basis, and this fact is less
surprising under atheism than theism.</i><br>
A central part of the doctrine of many religions is that there
is an immaterial component to the human mind, called the soul,
that provides us with our identity, personality and sense of
self and that survives the physical death of our bodies. This
claim can now be conclusively disproven by the science of
neurology, whose findings have revealed that the fundamental
aspects of our consciousness all arise from and are unified with
the physical structure of our brain. Damage to specific regions
of the brain can fragment our sense of identity, splitting the
mind up into distinct spheres of awareness, or erase it entirely
by destroying the ability to form new memories, leaving a person
caught in an endless mental loop. It can alter one's personality
and beliefs - including religious beliefs - in dramatic ways, or
exert an uncontrollable influence over behavior, to a point
where a person's closest friends and relatives believe they are
no longer the same person they once were. Such changes are very
strange and surprising under a theistic hypothesis of the soul,
but not at all surprising if we assume the atheistic position
that the mind arises purely from the functioning of the brain.
See "<a href="http://www.ebonmusings.org/atheism/ghost.html">A
Ghost in the Machine</a>" for more information.
<p>

<li><i>Gratuitous evil and unnecessary suffering are abundant,
and this fact is less surprising under atheism than theism.</i><br>
It has long been recognized, even by theists, that the one fact
about the world that is most unexpected and difficult to explain
under the assumption of a benevolent creator is the existence of
evil. But it is not just the mere fact of suffering that should
give theists pause, but rather its <i>magnitude</i> and its <i>
distribution</i>. There is not just a small amount of suffering
in the world, but a vast, horrendous amount, stemming not just
from acts of evil committed by human beings against each other,
but also from natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis,
droughts and epidemics. And evil is not distributed fairly,
afflicting only those who deserve it, but rather seemingly by
chance, striking the bad and the good alike. In fact, often
suffering seems to avoid the truly evil while concentrating on
the undeserving innocent.
<p>If there is a powerful being overseeing the world whose
attributes include goodness and justice, it should be surprising
in the extreme that evil occurs as it does. On the other hand,
if there is no higher power other than the impersonal natural
laws that do not take human needs into account, it is not
surprising at all that suffering exists. Therefore, when it
comes to explaining evil, atheism has by far the superior
explanation, and this gives us strong reason to think that
atheism is true. For more on the argument from evil, see "<a href="http://www.ebonmusings.org/atheism/allpossibleworlds.html">All
Possible Worlds</a>".
<p>

<li><i>Naturalism is the norm, and this fact is less surprising
under atheism than theism.</i><br>
This point can best be summarized as "miracles don't happen".
Obvious supernatural events are nonexistent, although the holy
books of most religions assure us they were common in the
distant past. Claims of miraculous occurrences invariably turn
out to be either trivial, anecdotal, spurious, or based on
arguments from ignorance (i.e., "We don't understand the cause
of this, so it must be a miracle"). Science, the human
enterprise which seeks to explain the universe by the operation
of natural laws without invocation of the supernatural, has been
resoundingly successful at this goal; so far a huge variety of
phenomena have come into the sphere of our understanding, and
none have been found that resist natural explanation.
<p>These facts are, of course, to be expected under atheism. If
the supernatural does not exist, then everything that happens
must have a natural explanation, and it is no surprise that we
do not observe any unambiguous miracles. Conversely, it is most
unexpected under theism that God does not perform them more
often, especially since a significant number of positive effects
would probably result. See "<a href="http://www.ebonmusings.org/atheism/burningbush.html">One
More Burning Bush</a>".
<p>

<li><i>There is no clear evidence of the existence of any gods,
and this fact is less surprising under atheism than theism.</i><br>
Not only are there no obvious miracles, human beings do not
possess any clear communication from God even in ways that are
not obviously supernatural, such as the simple, basic ways we
relate to each other. Nor does God perform any activities in our
daily lives, not even simple, ordinary activities, in a way that
can be reliably attributed to him. Although most religions
assure us it is well within God's power to disclose his
existence and speak to us and interact with us in such a way
that we could be sure that the message was genuine, this does
not happen. Instead, believers claim to be assured of God's
existence based on mere inward conviction, which is not a
reliable guide to the nature of reality regardless of how strong
it is, and on documents written, interpreted and approved by
human beings.
<p>Any clear communication or activity from God would obviously
be a death blow for atheism, but no such thing has happened. On
the other hand, if atheism is true, we would fully expect that
this would be the case. We would fully expect that believers
would rely solely on subjectively acquired feelings inaccessible
to outside verification, and that apologists and evangelists
would go around telling each other that they have discovered the
truth about God, although every single source the various
factions cite would, ultimately, be a human source. We would
fully expect that, although theists claim that "God is love", he
would never appear and <i>show</i> that love to us in the way a
parent shows love to their children. We would expect that
careful and painstaking examination of every aspect of the world
would uncover a grand web of cause and effect, but not the
slightest trace of influence of a power that stands above it
all.
<p>

<li><i>Religious texts contain many contradictions and
historical inaccuracies, and this fact is less surprising under
atheism than theism.</i><br>
If a particular book was dictated to humans by a perfect and
self-consistent deity, it is to be expected that that book would
likewise be free of internal error and contradiction. Similarly,
if a book was the product of a being that was present when the
events narrated in that book took place, we would expect it to
contain an accurate account of those events. However, when
examining religious texts, this is not what we actually find.
Instead, we find books that contain many mutually contradictory
or incompatible verses. In addition, when it is possible to
independently verify these books' historical accuracy through
archaeological or other scientific investigation, we often find
that they contain many passages which are implausible or false.
For examples of such contradictions in the holy texts of two
major religious traditions, see "<a href="http://www.ebonmusings.org/atheism/biblecontra.html">Foundation
of Sand</a>" and "<a href="http://www.ebonmusings.org/atheism/korancontra.html">Much
Incongruity</a>". For examples of historical inaccuracies in
these traditions, see "<a href="http://www.ebonmusings.org/atheism/otarch.html">Let
the Stones Speak</a>".
<p>This observation is less surprising under atheism than
theism. Contradictions or errors in a given religious text, of
course, do not prove that that text was not divinely inspired,
but it is much more surprising that a text inspired by a god
would contain errors than that a purely human-written one would.
Similarly, the errors in any one text do not mean that all
religions are false, but the more we examine and find to contain
such errors, the more confidence we can have in an inductive
generalization that all of them are probably the same way.
<p>

<li><i>Arguments for God's existence suffer from irreparable
logical flaws, and this fact is less surprising under atheism
than theism.</i><br>
Throughout the ages, theologians and philosophers have been
attempting to devise rational proofs of God's existence; and
without exception, all such efforts have fallen short. Not only
do these arguments ultimately fail, many of them are actually
premised on fundamental logical fallacies. For example, the
classic pro-theistic argument known as the ontological argument
suffers from circularity, while the cosmological argument is
built on special pleading, and the argument from design is
really just a disguised argument from ignorance. The moral
argument for God's existence has been dogged for centuries by
the insoluble Euthyphro rebuttal, while the more recent
presuppositional arguments rely on the fallacy of the false
dilemma. For more detailed refutations of these and other
pro-theistic arguments, see "<a href="http://www.ebonmusings.org/atheism/unmovedmover.html">Unmoved
Mover</a>".
<p>Granted, it is possible for God to exist and for there also
to be no irrefutable arguments proving that fact. However, this
outcome is still less surprising under atheism than theism. If
theism is true, it is not at all unreasonable to expect that God
might have structured the universe so that reason would enable
us to detect that fact. On the other hand, if atheism is true,
then the ultimate failure of all pro-theistic arguments is the
only possible outcome (assuming, of course, that logic does bear
some correspondence to reality). Certainly the failure of many
intelligent people throughout the ages to conclusively prove the
existence of God should tell us something.
<p>

<li><i>There are moral, fulfilled, happy people from all
religious backgrounds and also among nonbelievers, and this fact
is less surprising under atheism than theism.</i><br>
Many religions claim that genuine satisfaction in life can only
be found by belonging to that religion and worshipping its
deity, and that all attempts to acquire happiness any other way
will ultimately end in misery and frustration. Were any
particular religion true, we might well expect to find that this
was indeed the case. But this is not what we find. Instead, even
a cursory search will reveal that there are a vast number of
wise, virtuous, spiritual and happy people from <i>every</i>
religious background and from atheism as well. No religious
belief system's adherents are substantially better at dealing
with life's ups and downs, on the average, than members of any
other belief system. This is exactly as we would expect if no
one religion had a monopoly on the truth, giving further support
to atheism.
<p>
</li>
</ul>
<a name="moral"></a><b>Moral Reasons</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li><i>Many religions have cruel, dangerous or repressive
doctrines which it is morally incumbent upon us not to support.</i><br>
The first and most obvious moral reason to dissociate oneself
from religion is the existence of cruel or otherwise
unacceptable doctrines commonly associated with it. Though the
specific nature of these doctrines varies from one belief system
to another, virtually every form of theism so far conceived has
at least a few. One that is very common is the belief that women
are in some way inferior or subordinate to men. Such a belief
shows up, for example, in the Old Testament's valuation of women
as worth half as much as men; in the Christian Bible's command
that women keep silent in church and submissively obey men; or
in Islam's permitting men to marry multiple wives but never
wives to marry multiple husbands, or forcing women to wear
stifling black garb in public. Another immoral religious
doctrine is the belief that God will one day soon destroy the
world and save only his own, and that it is desirable that this
happen. This belief has led in many instances to believers
taking no action to remedy evils such as terrorism or
environmental destruction, on the grounds that it will all soon
come to an end anyway - or worse, causing violence themselves in
an effort to bring about the hoped-for apocalypse.
<p>In addition to these pernicious beliefs, there are others,
including the advocacy of death and torture as a punishment for
even minor transgressions; the support of racism, caste systems
and slavery; the opposition to the use of birth control even in
already desperately overcrowded regions of the planet; the
belief that God has granted us a divine mandate to ravage the
planet in any way we wish; the belief that absolution is free
and there is therefore no incentive to refrain from committing
evil acts; the support of monarchies and theocracies; the belief
that medicine should be withheld from the sick in favor of
prayer; prejudice against homosexuals and other minority groups;
and many, many more. In fact, any crime, injustice or evil deed
can be excused by claiming "God is on my side", and such
justifications <i>have</i> been offered for countless wrongs
committed throughout history.
<p>Morality demands that we refrain from supporting such
beliefs, and so the only moral course of action upon
encountering a religion that teaches one or more of them is to
refuse to be a member of it. Even if a religion was true and the
god it described actually existed, if it advocated immoral or
evil doctrines the only ethical thing to do would be to refuse
to follow it. If there are such beings as gods, they are bound
by morality's principles as surely as humans are; neither the
certain existence nor the great power wielded by Adolf Hitler,
for example, made obeying him the moral thing to do.
Fortunately, we do not seem to be in any comparable dilemma, as
there are strong
<a href="http://www.ebonmusings.org/atheism/necessityofatheism.html#evidential">
evidential reasons</a>, apart from any moral considerations, to
believe that no form of theism is true. However, this and other
moral arguments against religion give additional reason to be an
atheist.
<p>

<li><i>Many religions have histories of violence and hatred
which it is morally incumbent upon us to dissociate from.</i><br>
The history of religion on this planet is a history written in
blood. As far back as records exist, people have been fighting,
torturing and killing each other in the name of the gods.
Essentially the only religions that have never engaged in
warfare and bloodshed are those that have been so consistently
oppressed throughout their history that they have never had the
power to do so. The only ethical response for people of
conscience, when presented with these facts, is to dissociate
themselves from the religions that have been responsible for
them. As Jesus is reported to have said, "Every good tree bears
good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot
bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.... by
their fruit you will recognize them" (Matthew 7:17-20, NIV
translation).
<p>There are examples of this from every major religious
tradition. In Judaism, the Old Testament contains many instances
of the Israelites waging warfare and carrying out programs of
genocide purportedly under divine sanction, and today there are
still far-right Israeli nationalists who believe it is the
Jewish people's God-given right to own the entire Fertile
Crescent, driving out the other inhabitants by violence if
necessary. The crusades, inquisitions and witch hunts carried
out by the various medieval Christian churches linger in memory,
and today Christianity still has its share of racists and
fundamentalists who murder gays, bomb abortion clinics, and
picket the funerals of AIDS victims while gleefully proclaiming
the departed's eternal damnation. The terrorists and tyrants of
Islam are too obvious to need enumeration. Even members of
Eastern religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism have been known
to form murderous mobs that go on the rampage against people of
other belief systems. The Buddhist kingdom of Tibet prior to the
Chinese conquest, presenting a sharp contrast with the current
Dalai Lama's rhetoric about democracy and human rights, was a
brutal theocracy where the lay population was forced through
torture and imprisonment to support the monasteries (see
<a href="http://www.michaelparenti.org/Tibet.html">this article</a>).
</p>
<p>Although the more liberal and moderate members of such faiths
may be repulsed by such actions and may categorically disavow
them, this cannot change the fact that the extremists still use
the same holy book, believe in the same god, and worship in the
same way as their less conservative brethren, the only
difference being that they have different interpretations of a
few verses of their sacred texts. Nor does it change the fact
that this violence and hatred is not confined to a few isolated
events, but permeates the history of virtually every belief
system ever invented by humans. The only moral response to this
is a full and complete dissociation from these hatemongers, and
the best way to do that is by not belonging to the same belief
system as them at all.
<p>Some theists will no doubt protest that the ethical believers
should not be condemned for the crimes of the misguided ones.
And I agree that the morally good believers do not bear blame
for the actions of the evil ones, so long as they have not
defended or supported such actions. Nevertheless, when the
entire structure of a belief system is marred by violence and
unacceptable doctrine, the moral thing to do is to dissociate
oneself from it, in order to make it clear that such practices
will not be tolerated or supported.
<p>

<li><i>Many religions accumulate unnecessary amounts of wealth
and material possessions, a practice which it is morally
incumbent upon us not to support.</i><br>
Since time immemorial, religions worldwide have sought out the
most effective tools from extracting the maximum possible amount
of money from their followers. A common practice in Western
religions is tithing - the church's calling on its members to
hand over a stunning ten percent of their income each year. In
churches with millions of followers, even if only a small
percentage choose to tithe, the amount of wealth that is thereby
accumulated is enormous. Similarly, in many Eastern countries
past and present, all of society is expected to labor to support
the religious upper classes of monks and priests. The practices
that churches use to keep the money flowing in are endless - the
collection plates passed around at each sermon, the sale of
indulgences and prayers, the promise of worldly benefits in
return, the unceasing cries of persecution that inspire
believers who feel their faith is threatened to give generously
in support of it.
<p>Were the riches gained in this way used to do genuine good,
there would be little reason to object. But very often they are
not. Instead, many religions simply accumulate countless
millions of dollars in assets, including vast amounts of
property, huge and lavish church buildings, and unceasing luxury
for their leaders - this although virtually all religions teach
that excessive wealth is a barrier to salvation. Religious
groups' control over society enables them to pass laws exempting
themselves from outside scrutiny, so that they need not account
to anyone how they spend the money they make. While most
religions engage in at least <i>some</i> charity, the amount of
good they actually strive to accomplish is small compared to
what could be achieved if they put their full resources into the
effort, and in any case religious charity often comes at a
price.
<p>Morality demands that we not support this. The amount of
suffering and injustice in this world is so great that it is a
pressing moral obligation for us to use our resources to combat
it in the most effective way possible, rather than simply
handing them over to further enrich already wealthy and powerful
church hierarchies. Being an atheist, and giving the money
thereby saved to genuine charitable groups, is an effective way
to achieve this goal.
<p>

<li><i>Many religions display institutional corruption and
hypocrisy which it is morally incumbent upon us not to support.</i><br>
In addition to the evil actions discussed in the last point, it
is sadly the case that many organized religions do not follow
even the good teachings their canons contain. Many religions
whose texts preach the virtues of poverty and generosity have
leaders who enjoy extravagant riches and luxuriant lifestyles
made possible by donations from their followers, many of whom
are desperately poor themselves; others whose texts extol peace,
compassion and nonviolence have repeatedly engaged in war and
terrorism with the excuse that it is justified by God's will.
Others that preach about the necessity of fidelity and monogamy
have leaders that have engaged in extramarital affairs or
divorced and remarried numerous times. Still others have corrupt
hierarchies that have tried to cover up sex abuse and other
crimes committed by members of the clergy. (The Roman Catholic
church is the most visible, though not the only, recent
example.) Morality demands that we refrain from supporting such
corrupt and hypocritical institutions until and unless they put
an end to these transgressions and provide solid proof of their
having done so.
<p>

<li><i>Many religions have psychologically unhealthy or harmful
doctrines which it is morally incumbent upon us not to support.</i><br>
Most religions have at least one or a few doctrines which, if
believed in, are likely to cause mental suffering and anguish
both to the believers and to those around them. Among these
harmful beliefs are that life is a constant source of pain and
sorrow and this cannot be changed; that suffering and
persecution are desirable and bring people closer to God; that
all people are worthless sinners fully deserving of damnation;
that it is forbidden to associate with or speak to those who
believe differently; that there are vast conspiracies aligned
against the true believers; and that human beings are constantly
under siege by malignant demons or other evil supernatural
powers. The first two of these beliefs are likely to cause
believers to accept and even seek out suffering and rejection,
rather than making an effort to ease human suffering and get
along with others; in the worst case it may lead them to
actively inflict pain on others. The third belief leads to
feelings of guilt, worthlessness and self-hatred, as well as
disdain for the efforts of others to improve the general
welfare, while the fourth breaks up relationships and drives
apart people who could otherwise be happy together. There have
even been cases where the last two beliefs cause the mentally
ill to forego the medical treatment they need in favor of
ineffective measures like prayer and exorcism, which not only
will not cure their condition but may even drive them deeper
into it. In all cases, the harm caused by these beliefs should
be unacceptable to people of conscience, and should lead these
people to reject any belief system that teaches them.
<p>

<li><i>In general, theistic belief is a force for stagnation and
against progress, and it is morally incumbent upon us not to
support this.</i><br>
Throughout history, religion has been used to promote stagnation
and the status quo, acting as a barrier to human advancement
both intellectually and morally. It has had this effect for
several reasons. First, and not least important, is the amount
of resources that have been spent on religion. Even besides the
money most churches accumulate, theism has encouraged many
intelligent people to spend their lives debating pointless and
irresolvable theological disputes or evangelizing other
cultures, when their minds and their ability could much more
usefully be spent doing something of benefit to humanity. Second
is the frequent religious opposition to new knowledge. There was
a time when men of science were persecuted, tortured and
imprisoned by inquisitions, and even today, religious opposition
to science is still widespread and strong. Creationists seek to
prevent scientific theories that offend them from being taught
in school, and theist apologists try to prevent natural
phenomena from being studied by labeling them miracles, in an
example of
<a href="http://www.ebonmusings.org/atheism/gaps.html">God of
the Gaps</a> reasoning. Third is the use of religion to justify
the current state of society and denounce efforts for change.
History is filled with examples of churches that have denounced
societal progress and worked hand-in-hand with the ruling elite
to oppress the poor and the disenfranchised, usually by teaching
them that they will be rewarded in the next life for
unquestioning obedience and passivity in this one. Finally,
religion encourages fatalism, the belief that whatever happens
is God's will and we should not seek to change it.
<p>It is the fearless willingness to investigate the world and
follow wherever the evidence leads that has brought about every
improvement in the human condition that we have ever achieved.
Religion, although not always or in every case, very frequently
works against this, and on balance it has been a force for
stagnation and even regression, rather than progress. People of
conscience should therefore reject it on these grounds.
<p>

<li><i>In general, theistic belief serves as an excuse for the
few to impose their will upon the many, and it is morally
incumbent upon us not to support this.</i><br>
Although a very few religions teach - and, more importantly, put
into practice - the belief that all people are equal in the
sight of God and that all people have equal access to God, the
opposite condition is by far more common. The absolutist
theocracies, repressive caste systems and divine-right
monarchies that have been so common throughout history and
persist even today show how readily religion can be used as a
tool of oppression and control, how easily it can justify
inequality and unfair systems of rule. There is no major world
religion that has not at some point been used to excuse such
unjust institutions; even purportedly peaceful Eastern faiths
such as Buddhism have given rise to tyrannical theocracies.
<p>By contrast, history has shown us that democratic governments
that abide by the principle of separation of church and state
are far more efficient, more advanced, and more respectful of
human rights. There is therefore strong moral reason to support
this type of government, and the best basis for doing so is to
be an atheist, since atheists have solid reason to reject the
claim that some people are more favored by God than others. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="practical"></a><b>Practical Reasons</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li><i>Atheism offers the freedom to live your life as you see
fit.</i><br>
Most religions offer a strict, tightly conscribed view of what
constitutes acceptable behavior. They set restrictions on what
sorts of activities their followers are supposed to prefer or
reject, what their purpose and goals in life should be, whom
they should obey, and what they should derive meaning and
satisfaction from. There are long lists of things that their
followers, in order to fit in, must do or refrain from doing;
sometimes there are restrictions on how they dress, eat, speak
and even vote. This effect is especially pronounced in
conservative and fundamentalist religious communities where the
lives of each person are planned out in advance with little if
any regard for what those people themselves may want, and taken
to an extreme in cults that attempt to control literally every
moment of their members' lives.
<p>An atheist, by contrast, is free of this confinement. Atheism
has no hierarchy of authority or immutable scripture that forces
its followers to live a certain way; the essence of atheism is
the free choice of the individual. This does not mean that an
atheist can behave as they want without regard for others - no
one is exempt from the principles of morality. But it <i>does</i>
mean that an atheist has the freedom to choose their own
purpose, select their own path, and decide for themselves what
makes their life meaningful and worthwhile to them. The feeling
of deep inner satisfaction that comes from living a fearlessly
self-directed life can only be imagined by those forced into the
narrow and shallow paths of conventional religion.
<p>

<li><i>Atheism offers the freedom to make up your own mind.</i><br>
In line with the last point, most religions put limitations not
on just how their believers may act, but what and how they may
think. Ancient texts and their modern interpreters in the church
hierarchies strictly prescribe how their followers are allowed
to view the world, what topics they must approve or disapprove
of, and often, what questions they are not allowed to ask. Some
religions go as far as to command their followers not to expose
themselves to certain knowledge deemed "dangerous". To name an
especially egregious example, the one-billion-member Roman
Catholic church only several decades ago abolished its
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_Librorum_Prohibitorum">
Index of Forbidden Books</a>, which for centuries threatened
with excommunication any Catholic who read any titles on the
list without special permission.
<p>In contrast to this barrage of prohibition, atheism offers
the freedom to think, believe, question and form opinions as one
sees fit. To an atheist, there is no forbidden knowledge, there
are no prohibited books, and there are no questions that may not
be asked. Where the religious mind sees a mental landscape
bristling with bars and locks, the atheist sees a wide-open
horizon, where nothing is off-limits and the inquiring mind may
travel wherever it pleases. Atheists are entirely free to study
all perspectives on any topic and decide for themselves what
they believe.
<p>

<li><i>Atheism offers the freedom to tolerate others.</i><br>
Many major religious traditions, in addition to dictating their
followers' actions and beliefs, further instruct them not to
associate with those whose beliefs are different. The Christian
Bible, for example, commands believers to live apart from
non-Christians, "for what fellowship hath righteousness with
unrighteousness?" (2 Corinthians 6:14). The Islamic Qur'an is
similar, with verses admonishing Muslims not to befriend those
who believe differently (9:23).
<p>By contrast, atheism has no such prohibitions. Rather than
being limited to a restricted subset of humanity, an atheist can
freely associate with anyone they choose, and can find friends
and loved ones from any background. Nor is an atheist required
to look down on others' actions as "sinful", but can accept them
for who they are. Members of such xenophobic religious
traditions will never know the many friendly, intelligent,
loving, and generous people who come from belief systems other
than their own, but an atheist labors under no such
restrictions.
<p>

<li><i>Atheism saves time and money.</i><br>
A minor point, though not too minor to overlook, is that being
an atheist saves one the resources that would otherwise be spent
on attending church and other religious services. More
conservative denominations often expect members to attend
services multiple times a week, sometimes for hours each time;
but even just one hour a week gained back by not attending
church can be a valuable resource, whether for accomplishing
something productive or simply spent in quiet contemplation.
Likewise, virtually all denominations expect constant donations,
and many expect members to tithe as much as 10% of their income.
Being an atheist allows one to use this money for more
worthwhile ends than propping up an already wealthy church
hierarchy.
<p>

<li><i>Atheism is an education in critical thinking.</i><br>
For obvious reasons, most religions do not place a high emphasis
on teaching their followers the principles of skepticism and
critical thinking, preferring instead to convey the message that
unquestioning faith is a virtue. But this way of viewing the
world cannot help but have repercussions in other areas. Namely,
theists who are taught that evidence is irrelevant and that
truth is decided by the strength of one's belief are more likely
to be deceived by all manner of false or fraudulent claims. By
contrast, an atheist accustomed to being skeptical of
extraordinary claims and experienced in detecting common errors
of reasoning already has a mental toolkit that will help them
see through such impostures.
<p>

<li><i>Atheism relieves the need to defend the indefensible.</i><br>
To be an atheist is to be released from the perpetual need to
prop up tired, false beliefs with equally threadbare
apologetics. Atheists no longer have to make excuses for why
they are allowing the millennia-old writings of primitive and
superstitious people to direct every aspect of their lives
today. Atheists do not have to justify why they are following
the moral advice of books that approve of slavery, the
inequality of women, and war and genocide in the name of God.
Atheists do not have to make excuses for why an all-powerful,
all-knowing, all-loving entity never takes any clear action to
help human beings who need it. Atheists no longer have to devote
the mental effort to believing in absurd myths of talking
snakes, people walking on water, or men being swallowed by giant
fish and surviving, when everyone knows such things do not
happen in the real world. Atheists, in short, do not have to
believe in anything but what is real, verifiable, and provable,
and can focus their energies on dealing with the world in which
they live, rather than bending their minds to believing in
another world of fantasy and miracle.
<p>

<li><i>Atheism offers respite from feelings of worthlessness and
guilt.</i><br>
Many religions teach that human beings are <i>all</i> sinners,
stained and worthless in God's eyes and fully deserving of his
punishment and wrath. Others teach that there is a huge number
of elaborate and arbitrary rules which people must strictly
follow at all times, and that if they transgress they are
"dirty" until they subject themselves to rituals of cleansing
and absolution. Still others teach that a person's worth is
entirely dependent on whether they believe certain things. All
such teachings are likely to produce in their adherents feelings
of perpetual guilt, shame and self-loathing. Atheism, by
contrast, does not teach any of these things. Combined with a
humanist philosophy that respects the inherent dignity and worth
of each person, it offers a powerful antidote to feelings of
worthlessness.
<p>

<li><i>Atheism offers respite from fear.</i><br>
For many theists, following their religion is a life of constant
fear: fear that the world is conspiring against them, fear that
they are constantly under attack by evil spirits, fear that a
wrathful God is watching them and will condemn them to Hell if
they sin, fear that the world may end at any moment, fear that
they will be excommunicated or ostracized by their church
community if they put a foot wrong, fear that their friends and
loved ones who believe differently will be damned. Atheism, by
contrast, offers release from these superstitious and unfounded
fears, and in their place offers a credo of hope: there are no
supernatural powers arrayed against us, nor must we live in
constant fear of judgment. We are human beings, alive and free,
and our destiny is in our own hands.
<p>
<li><i>Atheism offers the ability to view yourself and others as
equals.</i><br>
As already noted, many religions contain morally unacceptable
teachings about the inequality of women, homosexuals,
minorities, and other societal groups and classes. Many others
also contain teachings about how some people are closer to or
more favored by God than others, while the rest are lesser in
some way. Atheism offers freedom from these pervasive
prejudices, granting instead the realization that we are all
human beings, alike in dignity. But even beyond this, many
religions offer a dire view of the world where many of the
people you meet and interact with every day are destined for an
eternity of unimaginable suffering in Hell, and where it is
every believer's duty to convert these people if possible, where
the primary purpose of every relationship with a nonbeliever
must ultimately be an attempt to "save" them. But it is
impossible to have a deep and meaningful relationship with
someone whom you view as a mere target for conversion rather
than a human being, and so this belief will in many cases
ultimately lead to frustration, loneliness, and unhappiness.
Atheism lifts this psychological burden by allowing you to
accept other people for who they are without feeling that you
need to change them.
<p>
<li><i>Atheism offers happiness.</i><br>
The last, and best, practical reason to be an atheist is that it
can make possible a life of happiness and contentment. Despite
the never-ending barrage of stereotypes from religious
apologists who claim atheism offers nothing but darkness and
misery, the truth is that this is not so. The <i>process</i> of
deconversion is often difficult and emotionally wrenching for
people who have had a strong religious upbringing, but on the
other side of this transition there is clear air and freedom,
and the promise of a peaceful life where all the strife, the
confusion, and the wrestling with the insoluble questions of
faith have finally ceased. Atheists understand the basis for
morality, that simple compassion is a better reason to do what
is right than ten thousand commands from on high. Atheists
understand their relationship to the rest of the universe and
the awe-inspiring cosmic processes that brought us into being
here. Atheists appreciate the beauty of the world and the
reasons why it is something worth fighting to preserve. Atheists
possess the exhilarating freedom to determine their own
destinies, chart their own heading in life, and make up their
minds for themselves. Atheists know the thrill of a mind free to
travel and explore wherever it wishes. And atheists can live
lives of purpose, meaning and deep, genuine fulfillment and
inner happiness just as well as any theist can.
<p>There is nothing to fear about atheism, and much that it has
to offer. The sooner we all realize this, the better off we will
all be. Sadly, despite all the reasons to do otherwise, the
human race seems poised to continue on its religious path into
the foreseeable future, and the associated prejudices,
injustices, and futile strivings after the unseen will almost
certainly continue as well. However, a day may come when
humankind finally grasps the necessity of atheism. On that day,
we will wake from our religious dream and at last see the world
as it truly is. On that day, perhaps, we can finally leave all
the old fears and struggles behind and step into the light of
the morning for all time. On that day, we will at last be free.
