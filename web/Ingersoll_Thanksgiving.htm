<p><h1>Robert Ingersoll on Thanksgiving</h1>
If we cannot thank the orthodox churches -- if we cannot thank
the unknown, the incomprehensible, the supernatural -- if we cannot
thank Nature -- if we can not kneel to a Guess, or prostrate
ourselves before a Perhaps -- whom shall we thank?

<p>Let us see what the worldly have done -- what has been
accomplished by those not "called," not "set apart," not
"inspired," not filled with the Holy Ghost -- by those who were
neglected by all the Gods.

<p>...

<p>They have rescued us from the prisons of fear, and snatched
our souls from the fangs and claws of superstition's loathsome,
crawling, flying beasts. They have given us the liberty to think
and the courage to express our thoughts. They have changed the
frightened, the enslaved, the kneeling, the prostrate into men and
women -- clothed them in their right minds and made them truly
free. They have uncrowned the phantoms, wrested the scepters from
the ghosts and given this world to the children of men. They have
driven from the heart the fiends of fear and extinguished the
flames of hell.

<p>...

<p>All this has been done by the worldly -- by those who were not
"called" or "set apart" or filled with the Holy Ghost or had the
slightest claim to "apostolic succession." The men who accomplished
these things were not "inspired." They had no revelation -- no
supernatural aid. They were not clad in sacred vestments, and
tiaras were not upon their brows. They were not even ordained. They
used their senses, observed and recorded facts. They had confidence
in reason. They were patient searchers for the truth. They turned
their attention to the affairs of this world. They were not saints.
They were sensible men. They worked for themselves, for wife and
child and for the benefit of all.

<p>To these men we are indebted for all we are, for all we know,
for all we have. They were the creators of civilization -- the
founders of free states -- the saviors of liberty -- the destroyers
of superstition and the great captains in the army of progress.

<p>...

<p>I thank the heroes, the destroyers of prejudice and fear --
the dethroners of savage gods -- the extinguishers of hate's
eternal fire -- the heroes, the breakers of chains -- the founders
of free states -- the makers of just laws -- the heroes who fought
and fell on countless fields -- the heroes whose dungeons became
shrines -- the heroes whose blood made scaffolds sacred -- the
heroes, the apostles of reason, the disciples of truth, the
soldiers of freedom -- the heroes who held high the holy torch and
filled the world with light.

<p>With all my heart I thank them all.
<p>Happy Thanksgiving!
