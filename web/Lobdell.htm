A book review by Ben Edward Akerley.<p>LOSING MY RELIGION: HOW I LOST MY
FAITH REPORTING ON RELIGION IN AMERICA - AND FOUND UNEXPECTED PEACE<br>by William Lobdell
<p>HarperCollins, New York&nbsp; 2/09 $25.99<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When a religion reporter for a major American metropolitan
daily confessed that during nearly a decade of covering religious news he
lost his own faith, that event became something well worth writing
about---precisely what former Los Angeles Times columnist and award-winning
journalist William Lobdell has accomplished in this candid and forthright
autobiographical account of his retreat from belief.&nbsp; His journey from faith
to unbelief differs from other deconversion chronicles because, unlike men
of the cloth who forsake their vows after years of ministering to others,
Lobdell was just an ordinary lay believer.
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Brought up&nbsp;in the Episcopal church, he stopped going at age 17,
but then in his late 20s decided to attend a nondenominational church and,
immersing himself in Christian teachings, joined the ranks of the "born
again."&nbsp; When he was hired by the Los Angeles Times for their religion beat,
the events of the next 8 years would gradually erode his faith to the point
of deciding that God was no longer necessary in his life.
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of the hundreds of stories that he profiled during that time,
some chipped away at his belief system much more aggressively than others.
The Catholic church child abuse scandal in general and the case of one
priest in Alaska molesting 70 victims in particular had tremendous impact on
his now-wavering orthodoxy.&nbsp; The attitude of the Catholic hierarchy's much
greater concern for the welfare of the clergy than for the damage done to
the victims themselves also caused him to harbor grave concerns fueled by
the huge fallout from the massive cover up.&nbsp; The existence of a vast network
of sexual abuse survivors easily enabled this interviewer to connect with
them and to hear firsthand their often horrific descriptions of sexual
violation or impregnation.
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An eye-opening revelation came from attendance at an ex-Mormon
conference held to coincide with the General Conference of the faithful who
venomously condemned and rejected any criticism from those apostates who had
left the fold.&nbsp; The ex-Mormons warmly welcomed a journalist in their midst
for they were quite eager to share their stories of rejection, alienation,
humiliation and financial loss once they left the Mother Church behind.
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another investigative assignment took him to the faith healer
Benny Hinn who lured the desperately infirm with promises of miraculous
cures.&nbsp; Yet, the reporter found that no serious conditions were ever healed
and that minor "cures" could logically be attributed to a placebo-like
effect.
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His reportage on the Trinity Broadcasting System, which
had&nbsp;suppressed numerous sexual and fiscal irregularities, exposed this
beacon of Christian values to be a hollow and money-hungry institution even
more greedy and corrupt than any Wall Street enterprise.
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But the real turning point in his transformation occurred
when the writer and his wife Greer went to see Julia Sweeney's one-woman
show "Letting Go of God."&nbsp; Greer's own serious misgivings about her
indoctrination had intensified considerably the moment her local parish
priest told her she was an adulteress living in sin because she had married
outside the Church and wed a non-Catholic.&nbsp; So this first-person drama had
special resonance and poignancy with them both because Julia had been a
cradle Catholic just like Greer and Bill had enrolled in Catholic catechism
classes in order to convert so that they could enter into a union recognized
and blessed by the Church.&nbsp; However, his arduous course work elicited many
uncertainties about Catholic doctrine.&nbsp; Julia Sweeney effectively
demonstrated how to reject it all as the best path to self-liberation.
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He currently labels himself a reluctant atheist who
steadfastly eschews affiliation with any freethought groups which constitute
the atheist activist movement.&nbsp; He characterizes Dawkins, Harris and
Hitchens as an ungodly trio which has supplanted the Christian Trinity with
the missionary fervor of secular fundamentalism sometimes equal to the most
evangelical outlook and every bit as intolerant and dismissive of alternative views.
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fast approaching 50, the author now cheerfully embraces a
secular, rationalist perspective as he tersely appraises his newfound
freedom: "I don't have eternity to fall back on, so my focus on the present has sharpened."
