Complaining about Christmas is one of the most enduring of
Christmas traditions. It's not so much the holiday itself
that bothers us. It's the way other people insist on
celebrating it. In his new book <em>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1595230165/qid=1134576029/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/103-1512817-2852621?s=books&v=glance&n=283155">
The War on Christmas</a></em>, Fox News host John Gibson
argues for a more Christian Christmas, one that includes
crèches and carols in public schools and city halls.
"Christians are coming to retake their place in the public
square, and the most natural battleground in this war is
Christmas," he writes. With their campaign for the phrase
"Merry Christmas" in stores and their brief boycott of
Target, religious advocacy groups like the Alliance Defense
Fund and the American Family Association are trying to prove
him right.
<p>Gibson begins his book with an ode to the Christmas of
his youth and says that he's defending traditional public
celebration of the holiday from bullying ACLU lawyers and
other secularists who are perpetrating a "Liberal Plot to
Ban the Sacred Christian Holiday," as the subtitle of his
book puts it. As a matter of American history, however, some
of the strongest complaints about the public celebration of
Christmas have been lodged from within the Christian
tradition—by devout Christians who had little use for the
holiday. For a surprising number of American believers, the
chief concern wasn't putting Christ back into Christmas. It
was taking Christmas out of Christianity.
<p>Liberal plots notwithstanding, the Americans who
succeeded in banning the holiday were the Puritans of 17<sup>th</sup>-century
Massachusetts. Between 1659 and 1681, Christmas celebrations
were outlawed in the colony, and the law declared that
anyone caught "observing, by abstinence from labor, feasting
or any other way any such days as Christmas day, shall pay
for every such offense five shillings." Finding no biblical
authority for celebrating Jesus' birth on Dec. 25, the
theocrats who ran Massachusetts regarded the holiday as a
mere human invention, a remnant of a heathen past. They also
disapproved of the rowdy celebrations that went along with
it. "How few there are comparatively that spend those
holidays … after an holy manner," the Rev. Increase Mather
lamented in 1687. "But they are consumed in Compotations, in
Interludes, in playing at Cards, in Revellings, in excess of
Wine, in Mad Mirth."<p></td>

<td vAlign="top" align="default" width="100%">After the
English Restoration government reclaimed control of
Massachusetts from the Puritans in the 1680s, one of the
first acts of the newly appointed royal governor of the
colony was to sponsor and attend Christmas religious
services. Perhaps fearing a militant Puritan backlash, for
the 1686 services he was flanked by redcoats. The Puritan
disdain for the holiday endured: As late as 1869,
public-school kids in Boston could be expelled for skipping
class on Christmas Day.<p>The Puritans are the most cited
example of anti-Christmas spirit, but not the only one.
Quakers, too, took a pass, reasoning that, in the words of
17<sup>th</sup>-century Quaker apologist Robert Barclay,
"All days are alike holy in the sight of God." The Quakers
never translated their dismissal of Christmas into
legislation in their stronghold in Colonial Pennsylvania.
But local meetings, as the Quakers call their assemblies,
urged their members to disdain Christmas and to be "zealous
in their testimony against the holding up of such days." As
late as 1810, the <em>Philadelphia Democratic Press</em>
reported that few Pennsylvanians celebrated the holiday.
<p>Observance of Christmas, or the lack thereof, was one way
to differentiate among the Christian sects of Colonial and
19<sup>th</sup>-century America. Anglicans, Moravians, Dutch
Reformed, and Lutherans, to name just a few, did; Quakers,
Puritans, Separatists, Baptists, and some Presbyterians<strong>
</strong>did not. An 1855 <em>New York Times</em> report on
Christmas services in the city noted that Baptist and
Methodist churches were closed because they "do not accept
the day as a holy one," while Episcopal and Catholic
churches were open and "decked with evergreens." New England
Congregationalist preacher Henry Ward Beecher remembered
decorative greenery as an exotic touch that one could see
only in Episcopal churches, "a Romish institution kept up by
the Romish church."
<p>Naturally, some celebrants of the holiday complained
about the abstainers. In 1867, Reformed Church minister
Henry Harbaugh protested that Presbyterians in his
Pennsylvania neighborhood "spend the day working as on any
other day. Their children grow up knowing nothing of
brightly lit Christmas trees, nor Christmas presents. God
have mercy on these Presbyterians, these pagans." You can
hear the echo of that sentiment today, in the criticism of
the megachurches that have announced that they will be
closed on Christmas, because their leaders think
congregations and church staff would rather remain home with
their families. "Our culture does not need any encouragement
to be more self-centered or narcissistic, or to stay at home
on Sunday," Bible scholar Ben Witherington III
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.beliefnet.com/story/180/story_18050_1.html">
wrote on Beliefnet</a> last week. "Shame on you,
megachurches."
<p>Gibson briefly refers to the Puritan ban on the holiday
but otherwise avoids any mention of division within the
Christian tradition over how to celebrate it. His "war on
Christmas" is purely a clash between secularists and
believers. It's worth remembering, however, that in past
American battles over Christmas, the combatants on both
sides were Christian soldiers.
