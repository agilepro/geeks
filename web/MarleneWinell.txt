Dr. Marlene Winell, a local therapist, will be speaking about the process of recovering from religious
fundamentalism. She has written a book on the subject, <a href=http://www.marlenewinell.com/ltf.html>
<i>Leaving the Fold: A Guide for Former Fundamentalists and Others Leaving their Religion</i></a>.<p>
The book is out of print, but she hopes to change this. Here is a quote from her
<a href=http://www.marlenewinell.com/>website:</a> "The problem of religious damage has not received much attention, since faith is considered by many to be a good thing. This book is about understanding and rebuilding life; it is not fault-finding, but aims to support the love for self that every human being needs. Leaving the Fold is a book for people who have rejected their rigid religious upbringing and now must cope with the related guilt, fear, anger and loneliness. Readers will learn to cherish their new independence, experience self love, accept their feelings, choose their own reality, and learn to live in the here-and-now."<p>
