to me 
Hi Mark thanks for your reply, 

Hope you enjoyed your trip. I just took a trip camping through Idaho myself. I'd never seen it that extensively before, but it's a beautiful state!

So I was hoping to put up a text link on this page - http://www.godlessgeeks.com/LINKS/BibleQuotes.htm - anywhere you think it fits, so that it just kind of fits in with the rest of the text on the page. Here's the text - code included:

As you can see these verses from the bible contain many discrepancies. Perhaps the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/open/innovations/webconferencing">multiple</a> writers did not have <a href="http://doit.maryland.gov/contracts/Pages/ConferencingServicesWeb.aspx">access</a> to a <a href="http://www.conferencecallsunlimited.com/web-conferencing/">web conferencing service</a> to get their stories straight?

I usually do $85 per year for these ads, and I'm interested in booking a year if you have the space. Let me know if this works for you, and send me your paypal email address!

btw, it's really nice to see such an extensive atheism resource. I'm right with you.

Many thanks, 

Jessica
