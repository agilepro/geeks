<h2 align=center>The credit crunch could be a boon for irrational belief</h2>
04 February 2009

<p>SCIENCE has allowed us to smooth over many of the natural ups and downs of
human existence. We have predictable harvests, food on supermarket shelves,
savings and pensions that will help us get through difficult times, and
economies that provide most people with what they need to survive. Alongside
these developments a rational, scientific world view has become the dominant
mode of thought.
<p>Take the comforts away, however, and the rationality often evaporates too.
When human beings lose control over their lives, they become more prone to
superstition, spiritual searchings and conspiracy theories.
<p>Some of these losses of control are self-inflicted: studies show that people
in risky professions - deep-sea fishermen and sky-divers, for example - perform
a greater number of superstitious rituals than those with safe desk jobs.
Others, though, are a response to circumstances. For example, people living in
high-risk areas of the Middle East, such as Tel Aviv, are much more likely to
carry a lucky charm or avoid walking under ladders. A 2007 study showed that the
growth rate of evangelical churches in the US jumps 50 per cent with the
downturn of each economic cycle. The global downturn is no different: church
leaders (and psychics) are now reporting brisk business.
<p>Uncertain times cause us to cast about more widely for explanations of our
circumstances - and rational reasoning, alas, does not always come naturally
when we are desperate for answers. It is ironic that science is revealing our
modern, sophisticated, scientific world view to have a fragile hold on our minds

(see "Natural born believers")</a>. But there are also lessons to be learned.
First, we ought to be more understanding of seemingly irrational world views.
Many psychologists now see irrationality as the default state of the human mind.
No wonder the idea that life arose spontaneously has such a hard time trumping
creationism: overcoming that "natural" perspective takes a lot of cognitive
effort. Research into irrationality may also provide insights to help guide the
treatment of those suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder and related
mental illnesses.
<p>It is ironic that science is revealing our sophisticated,
scientific world view to have a fragile hold.
<p>The other lesson is more direct: be careful. In a recession, or any other
time of uncertainty, you are more likely to make bad decisions. By all means
play the lottery if it provides a momentary diversion from the gloom. But keep
your head. However seductive and comforting the idea of a win, and however
tricky your circumstances, playing the lottery is not a rational path to riches.
Even if God did tell you this week's numbers.
