<h2>Richard Dawkins has long trumpeted the rationale of science.
Now, at 65, he has finally marshalled a lifetime's arguments
against believing in God </h2>

<p>“THE GOD DELUSION” is an irreverent book. The author, Richard
Dawkins, accuses Jesus of having “dodgy family values”. And
don't get him started on the God of the Old Testament, “a
misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal,
filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sado-masochistic,
capriciously malevolent bully”.
<p>Mr Dawkins is an atheist, an evolutionary biologist and an
eloquent communicator about science, three passions that have
allowed him to construct a particularly comprehensive case
against religion. Everyone should read it. Atheists will love Mr
Dawkins's incisive logic and rapier wit and theists will find
few better tests of the robustness of their faith. Even
agnostics, who claim to have no opinion on God, may be persuaded
that their position is an untenable waffle.<p>
Like several other anti-religious volumes of recent years (“The
End of Faith”, “Breaking the Spell”), Mr Dawkins's book is
partly a reaction to the September 11th attacks. These have been
portrayed as essentially religious acts. Whatever the hijackers'
political or social motivations, it was religious faith that
ultimately turned them into killing machines. They believed they
were doing God's work and would be justly rewarded in the
afterlife.
<p>It is easy to denounce such deluded zealots, but
what relation do they have to ordinary, “sensible” religious
people? The problem, as Mr Dawkins sees it, is that religious
moderates make the world safe for fundamentalists, by promoting
faith as a virtue and by enforcing an overly pious respect for
religion. (Why is it easier for a Quaker to avoid combat duty as
a conscientious objector than someone who simply deplores
violence?) Furthermore, the argument goes, any positive aspects
of religion can be replaced by equally beneficial non-religious
substitutes.
<p>As a prelude to these contestable claims, Mr Dawkins examines
the interesting question of why religion is so widespread.
Worshipping deities would seem to be an irrational and wasteful
habit, yet it has been found in all cultures. Wouldn't natural
selection have got rid of religious tendencies if religion were
clearly bad for humans after all?
<p>Not necessarily. Mr Dawkins advocates the idea that religion
is a by-product of mental abilities that evolved for other
purposes. One form of this theory is that children are
“programmed” to believe anything their parents tell them, which
is quite sensible in light of all the useful information parents
can share. But this system is vulnerable to becoming a conduit
for worthless information that is passed on for no other reason
than tradition.
<p>However, this does not explain the special appeal of
religious ideas as opposed to any bizarre ideas. Religious
thoughts must be especially compatible with human psychology.
“Religion has at one time or another been thought to fill four
main roles in human life: explanation, exhortation, consolation
and inspiration,” writes Mr Dawkins, enumerating the four
targets of his logical firepower.
<p>He shows that religion does not provide a satisfactory
explanation for anything. Here his arguments are well-rehearsed
and finely honed from decades of combating American
fundamentalists. This section will appeal to anyone who ever
wondered, if God created the universe, who created God?
<p>As for exhortation, he argues that in practice, religion is
not a legitimate source of morality. If it were, Jews would
still be executing those who work on the Sabbath. Where morality
actually does come from is less clear. Mr Dawkins suggests the
source is a combination of genetic instincts, which evolved
because morals allowed humans to benefit more efficiently from
co-operation, and a cultural <em>Zeitgeist</em>.
<p>For some people consolation and inspiration are genuine
benefits of religion, as even Mr Dawkins will allow. But these
functions can and should be fulfilled by other means, he says.
This is the most problematic part of his thesis. In his case
contemplation of the natural world does the job; his final
chapter is an ode to the perspective-altering discoveries of
modern physics. But only a minority will find as much
consolation in quantum physics as in the prospect of reuniting
with their dearly departed in heaven.
<p>Even if it is granted that religion should be expunged, how
does Mr Dawkins suggest this could be done? Buy his book as a
Christmas gift for one's religious friends? Obviously, many
people will never be persuaded; that is precisely the nature of
faith. The actual plan is twofold.
<p>First, Mr Dawkins wants to subvert the mode of transmission
between parent and child. He calls a religious upbringing a form
of indoctrination and equates it to child abuse. He wants to
encourage a change in the <em>Zeitgeist</em>, so that when
people hear the words “a Catholic child”, or “a Muslim child”,
they will wince, and ask how a child could already have formed
independent opinions on transubstantiation or <em>jihad</em>.
<p>His second and related plan is to energise atheists, whom he
regards as being in the same situation as homosexuals were 50
years ago: stigmatised and unelectable to public office (in
America, at least). Mr Dawkins dreams of a day when atheists are
as well organised and influential as Christian conservatives
have become. If nothing else, his book should help bring the
atheists out of the closet.</div>
