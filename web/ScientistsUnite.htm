<h2>Scientists should unite against threat from religion</h2>
<p>By <b><a href="http://www.samharris.org">Sam Harris</b></a>
<h3>Sir:</h3>
It was genuinely alarming to encounter Ziauddin Sardar's whitewash of Islam
in the pages of your journal ('Beyond the troubled relationship'
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/448131a">Nature 448, 2007</a>). Here, as elsewhere,
<i>Nature</i>'s coverage of religion has been unfailingly tactful — to the point of obscurantism.
<p>In his Commentary, Sardar seems to accept, at face value, the claim that Islam
constitutes an "intrinsically rational world view". Perhaps
there are occasions where public intellectuals must proclaim
the teachings of Islam to be perfectly in harmony with
scientific naturalism. But let us not do so, just yet, in
the world's foremost scientific journal.
<p>Under the basic teachings of Islam, the Koran cannot be challenged or
contradicted, being the perfect word of the creator of the
Universe. To speak of the compatibility of science and Islam
in 2007 is rather like speaking of the compatibility of
science and Christianity in the year 1633, just as Galileo
was being forced, under threat of death, to recant his
understanding of the Earth's motion.
<p>An Editorial announcing the publication of Francis Collins's book,
<i>The Language of God</i> ('Building bridges'<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/442110a">
Nature 442, 2006</a>) represents another
instance of high-minded squeamishness in addressing the
incompatibility of faith and reason. <i>Nature</i> praises Collins, a devout Christian, for engaging
"with people of faith to explore how science — both in its
mode of thought and its results — is consistent with their religious beliefs".
<p>But here is Collins on how he, as a scientist, finally became convinced of the
divinity of Jesus Christ: "On a beautiful fall day, as I was
hiking in the Cascade Mountains... the majesty and beauty of
God's creation overwhelmed my resistance. As I rounded a
corner and saw a beautiful and unexpected frozen waterfall,
hundreds of feet high, I knew the search was over. The next
morning, I knelt in the dewy grass as the sun rose and
surrendered to Jesus Christ."
<p>What does the "mode of thought" displayed by Collins have in common with science?
<i>The Language of God</i> should have sparked gasping outrage from the editors at
<i>Nature</i>. Instead, they deemed Collins's efforts "moving" and "laudable", commending him
for building a "bridge across the social and intellectual
divide that exists between most of US academia and the so-called heartlands."
<p>At a time when Muslim doctors and engineers stand accused of attempting atrocities
in the expectation of supernatural reward, when the Catholic
Church still preaches the sinfulness of condom use in
villages devastated by AIDS, when the president of the
United States repeatedly vetoes the most promising medical
research for religious reasons, much depends on the
scientific community presenting a united front against the forces of unreason.
<p>There are bridges and there are gangplanks, and it is the business of journals
such as <i>Nature</i> to know the difference.
