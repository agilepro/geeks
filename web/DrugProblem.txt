I had a "drug" problem when I was a young person and teenager.

I was "drug" to church on Sunday morning -
I was "drug" to church on Sunday night -
I was "drug" to church on Wednesday night -
I was "drug" to Sunday school every week -
I was "drug" to vacation bible school -
I was "drug" to the family altar to read the bible and pray.
I was also "drug" to the woodshed when I disobeyed my parents.

Those "drugs" are still in my veins, and they affect my behavior in every thing I do, say, and
think.  They are stronger than cocaine, crack or heroin.

If our children had not this "drug" problem, America would certainly be a better place.
