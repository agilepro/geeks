<p><hr><H2>Sat. Sept., 11 am - 4 pm, <a href=http://www.sfatheists.com/equinox2008.htm>Bay Area Atheists
Equinox Picnic<a> in SF's <a href=http://www.sfatheists.com/pinelakemap.jpg>Pine Lake Park</a></H2>
We've reserved the same fabulous venue we used at the Summer Solstice Picnic: Pine Lake Park.
<a href=http://www.sfatheists.com/pinelakemap.jpg>Pine Lake Park</a> is located
in the southwest quadrant of San Francisco, just north of Sloat Boulevard between 19th Avenue and 34th Avenue. The park
is a beautiful eucalyptus-lined meadow next to Stern Grove, site of the famous outdoor summer concerts.<p>
We'll get started about 11 AM and stay until about 4 PM. Please bring a potluck dish to share and $5 per person to
cover reservation and food/drink costs. Grilled burgers and hot dogs with all the fixin's will be provided, as well
as water, soft drinks, beer and wine. Activities are still being developed. If you have suggestions or would like
to volunteer anything, please let us know. (We do need some help staffing the grill!)<p>
Make your plans to celebrate the Equinox with your fellow Atheists on September 13. Although this is usually the best
time of year for comfortable warm weather in The City, dress in layers just in case. You may want to bring something
extra for the grill, frisbee, football, ball and glove, blanket, Scrabble, and even your dog (a popular dog run is
between the parking lot and the picnic site).
