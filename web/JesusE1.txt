<p align="justify">The earliest references to Jesus are in the writings of Paul (ne Saul), who had a 'vision' of Jesus
while he was on the road to Damascus.&nbsp; Paul's writings are part of the epistles, which were written after 50 CE.
<a href="#ce">[1]</a>&nbsp; Paul and the other epistle writers don't seem to have known any biographical details of Jesus'
life, or even the time of his Earthly existence.&nbsp; They don't mention Bethlehem, Nazareth, Galilee, Calvary or
Golgotha.&nbsp; Paul is anything but a witness for the actual existence of Jesus, explicitly saying that he never met
Jesus but just saw him in his 'vision'.&nbsp; Paul also refers to himself and Peter as apostles (messengers), and doesn't
refer to Peter as a
disciple (follower).&nbsp; This means that Paul doesn't think Peter actually followed a living Jesus, but a spiritual
sky-god savior that could only be known through revelation.&nbsp; Paul and the other the epistle writers don't mention any miracles that Jesus was supposed to have worked, his baptism, or his moral teachings.&nbsp;
<a href="#pj1">[2]</a>&nbsp; Paul even admitted that that all his ideas came from revelation.
<a href="#pj2">[3]</a>&nbsp; In other words, he made it up or got his inspiration from other religions.&nbsp; Five
prime candidates are Mithraism, which had a center in Tarsus (Paul's hometown), Zoroastrianism, and the worship of the
gods Horus, Dionysus and Osiris.&nbsp; All had many similarities to Christianity.
