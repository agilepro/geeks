style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>WASHINGTON - The steep
drop in worldwide family planning funds from the United States and unmet
pledges from other wealthy nations contributed to more than 300 million
unintended pregnancies and the deaths of an estimated 700,000 pregnant women
between 1995 and 2000, according to a global study on maternal health released yesterday.

report, the first of its kind, found that more than one-third of the deaths
were from problems associated with pregnancy, labor, and delivery. A majority
of the deaths, an estimated 400,000, were from complications resulting from
abortions carried out in unsanitary and often illegal conditions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>The study, carried out by the Global Health Council, the largest
membership organization on global health issues, was launched to assess
progress made since the 1994 International Conference on Population and
Development in Cairo. At the conference, delegate nations, including the United
States, committed to spending $17 billion annually for reproductive health care
for women.

<p>After the conference, the Clinton administration immediately
substantially increased funding to $580 million. But then two factors caused
funding to drop: a Republican-led budget-cutting revolution and a push from
antiabortion groups to enforce the so-called Mexico City policy that bars US
funds for any foreign organization that promotes or performs abortions.

<p>The level of US funding for maternal health care - nearly $500
million - still does not approach the 1994 levels.

<p>Timothy E. Wirth, who as undersecretary of state for global
affairs led the US delegation at Cairo, said the Clinton administration had
internally set a goal of $1 billion annually for family planning within a few
years. ''The ideological war against the Cairo plan of action has turned out to
be massive war against women and against protection from AIDS'' due to the lack
of availability of condoms, he said.

<p>Two months ago, the Bush administration withheld $34 million in
funds from the United Nations family planning organization because it works
with Chinese authorities who are alleged to coerce women into undergoing
abortions and sterilizations.

<p>''Unfortunately, since 1994, the collateral victims were the women
of the developing world,'' said Nils Daulaire, president of the Global Health
Council, a nonprofit group based in Washington and White River Junction, Vt.
''This is a totally preventable tragedy. We have the technology, the means, and
the cost is incredibly cheap.

<p>''For 35 years, the US led the world in supporting voluntary
family planning everywhere around the world. Both from our side and other
donors' side, it is clear this is one of the best investments one can make in
reducing the death toll around the world.''

<p>Daulaire was a key player in the Clinton administration on health
issues, serving as the senior health adviser to the head of the US Agency for
International Development.

<p>The Bush administration has said it will cut off funding to any
groups associated with programs that force women to have abortions. Population
Research Institute of Fort Royal, Va., an antiabortion group, has taken the
lead in criticizing family planning organizations, saying that some groups
coerce women into having abortions. In particular, the group sent undercover
workers to Peru in 1998 and China this year. Scott Weinberg, director of
governmental affairs for the group, said that they found in China ''forced
abortion, forced sterilization, destruction of homes for noncompliance, and
imprisonment for noncompliance.'' In Peru, they said, the United States was funding
a program in 1998 that promoted massive sterilization.

<p>The World Health Organization, a United Nations body, annually
estimates numbers of maternal deaths, pegging the number at more than 549,000
deaths in 2000. The Global Health Council narrowed its focus to unintended
pregnancies, an extremely difficult task largely due to poor reporting in many
countries. They did it by taking statistics from the US Census Bureau, UN
agencies, country reports, and private surveys; focusing on abortion rates and
mothers dying from unwanted births; and compiling a profile of all 227
countries in the world.

<p>Daulaire and other global health experts yesterday described the
estimates derived in the council's report as conservative. Their reasoning is
that since abortions are illegal in much of the world, many cases are not
reported.

<p>Allan Rosenfield, dean of Mailman School of Public Health at
Columbia University, reviewed the report prior to publication and said the data
is ''very difficult to obtain, is not straightforward, and no one collects
these data adequately.''

<p>But, he added, ''Most of us feel the data are underreported.''

<p>Global spending now is $11 billion for maternal health care, part
of which goes for HIV/AIDS programs, according to Population Action International.
Donors are contributing $2.6 billion, or 46 percent of the Cairo target. Poor
countries are spending 74 percent of their 1994 target. ''This report provides
an interesting way to answer the question of what is the price of doing too
little,'' said Sally Ethelston, vice president for communication at Population
Action International, an independent group that advocates universal access to
reproductive health care.

<p>The report's country analyses highlights the lack of spending and
adequate programs in several countries. Most notable is India, which by far led
the world with an estimated 159,143 deaths from unintended pregnancies. The
United States had 349 deaths during the six-year period, said the report.
