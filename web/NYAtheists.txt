PRESIDENT’S SERMON
THE TIME IS RIGHT FOR US TO GO ON THE OFFENSIVE
The “New Puritans” (religious right) have lost much public support
because of their extreme position and aggressive legal actions involving
the Terry Schiavo situation.
Congress (even many pro-lifers) now supports federal funding of
Embryonic stem cell research.
Moderate Republicans and Democrats have negotiated a non-Nuclear
Option Treaty.
George W.’s Iraqi War has become a quagmire and his private investment
account Social Security proposal has fallen on deaf ears.
Finally, after the mid-term 2006 elections, George W. will become
a lame duck President.
Our priority one: We need to dramatically increase our membership. We need people to commit an hour or two
a week to distribute NYC Atheists’ newsletters and literature to the public. (Street Fairs and high street-traffic
locations are good venues.) There are millions of non-believers and separation of church / state advocates
in America who need to be reached.
Our priority two: We need your financial support. As we grow, our operating costs have grown significantly.
For example: Our monthly meeting costs are about $300 (room rental, etc.). Our monthly newsletter costs
about $450 to print and distribute. We need individuals to help pick up partial, monthly, or annual expenses.
Our priority three: We need people to help us with our NYC Atheists’ Cable Show video editing, lighting,
audio, etc. We need someone to be our new newsletter editor. We need someone to help us with public and
press relations. We need volunteers to coordinate NYC Atheists events. We need a NYC Atheists facility.
ONLY THROUGH A LARGE AND INVOLVED MEMBERSHIP CAN WE CONTINUE OUR
PROGRESS AND HAVE AN IMPACT.

BELIEF
GETS IN THE WAY
OF LEARNING
Elmer Gantry (1960) is a film of
Sinclair Lewis's novel regarding the
charismatically engaging but
scandalous Midwestern salesman
turned preacher in the 1920s.
Elmer Gantry (Burt Lancaster) is a
huckster who sells shoeshine and
vacuum cleaners. Gantry is lustful,
coarse, loud, ambitious, motivated
by an easy dollar, golden-tongued,
and often drunk.
The opportunistic Gantry becomes
infatuated by a touring tent
ministry evangelist-healer, the
beautiful, pure, and dedicated Sister
Sharon Falconer (Jean Simmons),
and she is charmed by him as well:
"You're amusing and you smell like
a real man." He joins her tent
ministry and becomes her lover.
Gantry turns into an evangelizing,
Bible Belt revivalist preacher.
Exhibiting tremendous
showmanship, Brother Gantry, with
rolled up shirt-sleeves, preaches
hellfire and brimstone, thumps his
Bible, performs miracles, and leads
repentant sinners to conversion in
the Bible Belt tent meetings.
His popularity helps to increase her
fame and fortune, and she is able to
realize her dream of building her
own tabernacle of worship.
In an act of revenge, one of his old
girlfriends, minister's daughterturned-
prostitute Lulu Bains
(Shirley Jones) sets him up and
frames him with photographs taken
in a compromising situation,
ruining his reputation. The new
tabernacle opens, but Sister
Falconer tragically dies in a blazing
tent fire. When asked if he will
carry on Sister Sharon's work in the
lucrative revivalist business, Gantry
quotes scripture to explain how
experiences have matured him, and
why he will not continue.

Evolution v. Intelligent Design:
Debate?
By Ron Widelec
The battle between science and
religion in our schools is still
raging across the nation. The
conservative advocates of
Intelligent Design, the idea that life
is so complex, there must be a
creator, are winning a battle in
Kansas City. The school board of
Kansas City is debating the issue
even though the board members
have already said their votes cannot
be swayed and Intelligent Design
will be brought into the classrooms
to challenge the long held scientific
theory of Evolution.
Advocates of Evolution have
decided, however, not to engage in
this discussion, believing that by
giving Intelligent Design a podium
next to Evolution in a debate will
give the impression that Intelligent
Design has scientific credibility, a
notion that nearly all experts deny.
As religious fundamentalists
attempt to take over the school
curriculum and turn American
education into a factory for the
production of fundamentalists, is
this the right position to take?
Intelligent Design is gaining
ground and the scientific
community is taking the position of
silent protest. This approach
cannot succeed. The only way to
thwart the advances of creationism
is to challenge their absurd
argument point by point in front of
the national audience. To call the
Kansas City board meetings
“propaganda” and yet remain silent
is to forfeit our science classrooms
and the future of American
education. The American
Association for the Advancement
of Science (AAAS) declined to
enter the discussion claiming that
“the hearing would most likely
serve to confuse the public.” The
AAAS should be ashamed of
themselves, electing to retreat and
allow the public to be mis-educated
and indoctrinated rather than risk
“confusion.”
Luckily, during the Scopes Trial
some Americans showed a bit more
mettle. Going to war over
Evolution doesn’t mean real
science will win, but truth and
evidence should not be so easily
surrendered. As Galileo might say
if he was alive today and battling
for science “nevertheless, we did
evolve….”

Arthur Rubenstein, Polish-
American pianist (1886-1982).
During a radio interview with
Rubenstein the conversation took a
sharp turn away from music when
the interviewer suddenly asked,
"Mr. Rubenstein, do you believe in
god?" Rubenstein calmly replied,
"No. You see, what I believe in is
something much greater."

John Lennon, British musician
(1940-1980).
Lennon rejected religion and
dogma, but he was not really an
atheist - he espoused a sort of
vague spirituality.
From the song "Imagine";
"Imagine there's no heaven,
It's easy if you try,
No hell below us,
Above us only sky,
imagine all the people Living for
today. . .
Imagine there's no countries,
It isn't hard to do,
Nothing to kill or die for,
No religion too ."
From the song, "god,"
"god is a concept by which we
measure our pain
I don't believe in magic
I don't believe in I-Ching
I don't believe in Bible
I don't believe in Tarot
I don't believe in Hitler
I don't believe in Jesus."
And, from the song, "I Found Out"
"There ain't no Jesus gonna come
from the sky
Now that I found out I know I can
cry,
I found out! "

Paul Davies
Professor of natural philosophy at
the Australian Center for
Astrobiology, at Macquarie
University, in Sydney. He is the
author of twenty-five books,
including Are We Alone? (1995)
and The Fifth Miracle: The Search
for the Origin and Meaning of Life
(1998). Davies won the 1995
Templeton Prize for Progress in
Religion
"god of the gaps"
From his article E.T. and God,
Atlantic Monthly,
September 2003.
Ascribing the origin of life to a
divine miracle not only is anathema
to scientists but also is
theologically suspect. The term
"god of the gaps" was coined to
deride the notion that god can be
invoked as an explanation
whenever scientists have gaps in
their understanding. The trouble
with invoking god in this way is
that as science advances, the gaps
close, and god gets progressively
squeezed out of the story of nature.
Theologians long ago accepted that
they would forever be fighting a
rearguard battle if they tried to
challenge science on its own
ground. Using the formation of life
to prove the existence of god is a
tactic that risks instant demolition
should someone succeed in making
life in a test tube. And the idea that
god acts in fits and starts, moving
atoms around on odd occasions in
competition with natural forces, is a
decidedly uninspiring image of the
Grand Architect.
The theological battle line in
relation to the formation of life is
not, therefore, between the natural
and the miraculous but between
sheer chance and law like certitude.
Atheists tend to take the first side
and theists line up behind the
second but these divisions are
general and by no means absolute.
It's perfectly possible to be an
atheist and believe that life is built
ingeniously into the nature of the
universe. It's also possible to be a
theist and suppose that god
engineered just one planet with life,
with or without the help of
miracles.
Though the discovery of microbes
on Mars or elsewhere would ignite
a passionate theological debate, the
truly difficult issues surround the
prospect of advanced alien beings
in possession of intelligence and
technology. Most scientists don't
think that such beings exist, but for
forty years a dedicated band of
astronomers has been sweeping the
skies with radio telescopes in hopes
of finding a message from a
civilization elsewhere in the
galaxy. Their project is known as
SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial
Intelligence).
Because our solar system is
relatively young compared with the
universe overall, any alien
civilization the SETI researchers
might discover is likely to be much
older, and presumably wiser, than
ours. Indeed, it might have
achieved our level of science and
technology millions or even
billions of years ago. Just
contemplating the possibility of
such advanced extraterrestrials
appears to raise additional
uncomfortable questions for
religion.
The world's main faiths were all
founded in the pre-scientific era,
when Earth was widely believed to
be at the center of the universe and
humankind at the pinnacle of
creation. As scientific discoveries
have piled up over the past 500
years, our status has been
incrementally diminished. First
Earth was shown to be just one
planet of several orbiting the Sun.
Then the solar system itself was
relegated to the outer suburbs of the
galaxy, and the Sun classified as an
insignificant dwarf star among
billions. The theory of evolution
proposed that human beings
occupied just a small branch on a
complex evolutionary tree. This
pattern continued into the twentieth
century, when the supremacy of our
much vaunted intelligence came
under threat. Computers began to
outsmart us. Now genetic
engineering has raised the specter
of designer babies with
superintellects that leave ours far
behind. And we must consider the
uncomfortable possibility that in
astrobiological terms, god's
children may be galactic also-rans.
Theologians are used to putting a
brave face on such developments.
Over the centuries the Christian
church, for example, has time and
again been forced to accommodate
new scientific facts that challenge
existing doctrine. But these
accommodations have usually been
made reluctantly and very
belatedly. Only recently, for
example, did the Pope
acknowledge that Darwinian
evolution is more than just a
theory. If SETI succeeds,
theologians will not have the
luxury of decades of careful
deliberation to assess the
significance of the discovery. The
impact will be instant.

Frank Zappa, American musician
"If you want to get together in any
exclusive situation and have people
love you, fine-- but to hang all this
desperate sociology on the idea of
The Cloud-Guy who has The Big
Book, who knows if you've been
bad or good-- and CARES about
any of it-- to hang it all on that,
folks, is the chimpanzee part of the
brain working. "
Letter to Ex-NYC Mayor Koch
by Edith Amster, NYCA member
I firmly disagree with you that god
created evolution. What created
god in order for god to create
evolution? The whole idea is so
absurd since there is no empirical
evidence that any god or gods
existed in the heavens that you can
quote here. Science, when
confronted with evidence, changes
and is ever evolving. Religion has
no such testable device and too
many clerics in too many religions
say they have the answers, and you
will be saved (I don't know from
what) and god had spoken to them
personally. Who are these men to
have the arrogance of claiming
their right to profess what a deity
said or did not say to them?
Idols and visions to not perform
miracles. Science does! No one
has yet proven to me that god
exists; there is no evidence of a
god, there are too many gods
around and so many man-made
different beliefs and interpretations,
that I could never subscribe to the
god notion. Man made god/gods--
not the other way around and,
although I respect your intellectual
capabilities and respect you as
Mayor in New York City, but I
challenge you to prove to me and
others with concrete evidence the
existence of any god of any
religion. How men can worship
idols and dead men in devotion, is
beyond my rational thought! It is
up to the religious to prove there is
a god, not the other way around!
The written scriptures and the Bible
were written by scribes and men--
not god!
