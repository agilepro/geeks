<NYT_TEXT>
<p>George W. Bush was a supporter of the war in Vietnam. For a while.
<p>As he explained in his autobiography, "A Charge to Keep: My Journey to
the White House":
<p>"My inclination was to support the government and the war until proven
wrong, and that only came later, as I realized we could not explain the mission,
had no exit strategy, and did not seem to be fighting to win."
<p>How is it that he ultimately came to see the fiasco in Vietnam so clearly but
remains so blind to the frighteningly similar realities of his own war in Iraq?
Mr. Bush cannot explain our mission in Iraq and has nothing resembling an exit
strategy, and his troops - hobbled by shortages of personnel and by potentially
fatal American and Iraqi political considerations - are certainly not fighting
to win.
<p>As the situation in Iraq moves from bad to worse, the president, based on his
public comments, seems to be edging further and further from reality. This is
disturbing, to say the least. The news from Iraq is filled with reports of
kidnappings and beheadings, of people pleading desperately for their lives, of
American soldiers being ambushed and killed, of clusters of Iraqis being blown
to pieces by suicide bombers, and of the prospects for a credible election in
January tumbling toward nil.
<p>The war effort has deteriorated so drastically that the administration is
planning to take more than $3 billion earmarked for crucial reconstruction
projects and shift them to security programs designed to ward off the
increasingly deadly insurgency. A classified National Intelligence Estimate
prepared for the president contained no really good prospects for Iraq. The
best-case scenario was a country with only tenuous stability. The worst
potential outcome was civil war.
<p>The intelligence estimate was prepared in July, and the situation has only
worsened since then.
<p>Even Republicans are starting to voice their concerns about the unfolding
disaster. When asked on CBS's "Face the Nation" whether the U.S. was
winning the war in Iraq, Senator Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican, said,
"No, I don't think we're winning." He said the U.S. was "in deep
trouble in Iraq" and that some "recalibration of policy" would be
necessary to turn things around.
<p>Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican, said on "Fox News
Sunday": "The situation has obviously been somewhat deteriorating, to
say the least." He said "serious mistakes" have been made and
that most of them "can be traced back to not having sufficient numbers of
troops there."
<p>These are not doves talking. These are supporters of President Bush who
support the war in Iraq and believe it can be won. But they're also in touch
with reality.
<p>President Bush does not share their sense of alarm. He acknowledged that
"horrible scenes" are being shown on television and the Internet, but
he was unmoved by the gloomy intelligence estimates. According to Mr. Bush:
"The C.I.A. laid out several scenarios. It said that life could be lousy,
life could be O.K., life could be better."
<p>Que sera, sera.
<p>The president said he is personally optimistic and he delivered an upbeat
assessment of conditions in Iraq to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday. Iraq,
he said, is well on its way to being "secure, democratic, federal and
free."
<p>If you spend more than a little time immersed in the world according to Karl
Rove, you'll find that words lose even the remotest connection to reality. They
become nothing more than tools designed to achieve political ends. So it's not
easy to decipher what the president believes about Iraq.
<p>This is scary. With Americans, Iraqis and others dying horribly in the long
dark night of this American-led war, the world needs more from the president of
the United States than the fool's gold of his empty utterances.
<p>Perhaps someone can dislodge the president from Karl's clutches, shake him
and tell him that his war is a tremendous tragedy with implications far beyond
the election in November.
<p>At the moment there is no evidence the president understands anything about
the war. He led the nation into it with false pretenses. He never mobilized
sufficient numbers of troops. He seemed to believe the war was over in May 2003.
And he seems not to know how to proceed now.
<p>The tragic lesson of Vietnam is staring the president in the face. But he'll
have to become better acquainted with the real world before he can even begin to learn from it.
