<p class="style5" align="center"><strong>AMERICANS
UNITED URGES HIGH COURT TO UPHOLD INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS IN
PLEDGE CASE</strong></p>
<p class="style5" align="center"><strong>Constitution
Bars Public Schools From Pressuring Students To Make
Religious Professions, Says AU</strong></p>
<p class="style2">Public schools may not pressure
students to pledge belief in “one nation under
God,” Americans United for Separation of Church and
State today told the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="style2">Americans United and allied civil
liberties groups filed a friend-of-the-court brief
Feb. 13 insisting that the U.S. Constitution bars
public school officials from leading students in the
Pledge of Allegiance because addition of the words
“under God” has turned the patriotic ritual into
an affirmation of religious belief.</p>
<p class="style2">“Public schools are no place for
religious indoctrination,” said the Rev. Barry W.
Lynn, executive director of Americans United. “No
student should be forced to profess belief in God in
order to show love of country.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">The 30-page brief filed in <em>Elk
Grove Unified School District v. Newdow </em>argues
that public school promotion of the Pledge
“communicates to schoolchildren a forbidden message
of government endorsement of religion” and
“pressures schoolchildren to profess religious
belief and affirm religious ideals.” This violates
the First Amendment's church-state separation
provision, and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
was on solid constitutional ground when it ruled last
year that public schools may not sponsor daily
recitation of the Pledge.</p>
<p class="style2">“The pressure on a child to affirm
religion and religious belief by reciting the Pledge
is only magnified by the fact that refraining from
reciting it can be construed by teacher and classmates
as lack of patriotism,” states the brief. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Ayesha Khan, AU's legal director
and one of the brief's authors, said teacher-led
recitation of the pledge places some students in
precarious situations.</p>
<p class="style2">“It puts many students between a
rock and a hard place,” Khan said, “by forcing
them to betray their religious beliefs or appear
unpatriotic.”</p>
<p class="style2">The AU brief cites a clear
historical record demonstrating that Congress and
other public officials intended to promote religion
when “under God” was added to the Pledge in 1954.
When he signed the bill into law, President Dwight D.
Eisenhower said the legislation meant that
schoolchildren would daily “proclaim…the
dedication of our nation and our people to the
Almighty.”</p>
<p class="style2">The brief notes that elected
officials today still view the Pledge as a
government-backed statement of religious belief. An
appendix to the AU brief includes a letter from
Buddhists urging President George W. Bush to support
the 9th Circuit decision and to remind Congress of its
responsibility of upholding the Constitution and Bill
of Rights.</p>
<p class="style2">In his Nov. 13, 2002, response, Bush
brushed aside the appeal and insisted that the words
of the Pledge “help define our nation.” He wrote,
“During these challenging times, we are determined
to stand for these words…. When we pledge allegiance
to One Nation under God, our citizens participate in
an important American tradition of humbly seeking
wisdom and blessing of Divine Providence.”</p>
<p class="style2">The Bush administration joined with
lawyers for the Elk Grove school district in offering
a number of arguments in support of the policy of
requiring teacher-led, daily recitation of the Pledge.
For one, the administration and Elk Grove argue that
public school children are likely to perceive “under
God” as a statement about the nation's history and
political philosophy.</p>
<p class="style2">The AU brief, which was also signed
by the American Civil Liberties Union and Americans
for Religious Liberty, argues that it would take “a
very subtle six-year-old” to view a daily recital of
a pledge as merely an acknowledgment of the nation's
history. The brief also cites Supreme Court precedent
holding that “schoolchildren are subject to a
‘pronounced' and ‘particular risk' of indirect
coercion in school settings.” The Supreme Court has
therefore “been ‘particularly vigilant' in
ensuring public schools do not trample on students'
First Amendment rights.</p>
<p class="style2">Said AU's Lynn, “The First
Amendment leaves no room for government officials to
lead students in religious exercises. The Supreme
Court has placed great emphasis on protecting the
individual rights of all public schools students and
should do so again in this case.”</p>
<p class="style2" align="center"><em>Americans United
for Separation of Church and State is a religious
liberty watchdog group based in Washington, D.C.
Founded in 1947, the organization educates Americans
about the importance of church-based separation in
safeguarding religious freedom.</em></p>
