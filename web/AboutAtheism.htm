<p>By Sam Harris </p>
<p>December 24, 2006 <br>
<i>The Los Angeles Times <br>

SEVERAL POLLS indicate that the term “atheism” has acquired 
such an extraordinary stigma in the United States that being
an atheist is now a perfect impediment to a career in
politics (in a way that being black, Muslim or homosexual is
not). According to a recent Newsweek poll, only 37% of
Americans would vote for an otherwise qualified atheist for
president. </p>
<p>Atheists are often imagined to be intolerant, immoral,
depressed, blind to the beauty of nature and dogmatically
closed to evidence of the supernatural. </p>
<p>Even John Locke, one of the great patriarchs of the
Enlightenment, believed that atheism was “not at all to be
tolerated” because, he said, “promises, covenants and oaths,
which are the bonds of human societies, can have no hold
upon an atheist.” </p>
<p>That was more than 300 years ago. But in the United
States today, little seems to have changed. A remarkable 87%
of the population claims “never to doubt” the existence of
God; fewer than 10% identify themselves as atheists — and
their reputation appears to be deteriorating. </p>
<p>Given that we know that atheists are often among the most
intelligent and scientifically literate people in any
society, it seems important to deflate the myths that
prevent them from playing a larger role in our national
discourse. </p>
<p><b>1) Atheists believe that life is meaningless.</b> </p>
<p>On the contrary, religious people often worry that life
is meaningless and imagine that it can only be redeemed by
the promise of eternal happiness beyond the grave. Atheists
tend to be quite sure that life is precious. Life is imbued
with meaning by being really and fully lived. Our
relationships with those we love are meaningful now; they
need not last forever to be made so. Atheists tend to find
this fear of meaninglessness … well … meaningless. </p>
<p><b>2) Atheism is responsible for the greatest crimes in
human history.</b> </p>
<p>People of faith often claim that the crimes of Hitler,
Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot were the inevitable product of
unbelief. The problem with fascism and communism, however,
is not that they are too critical of religion; the problem
is that they are too much like religions. Such regimes are
dogmatic to the core and generally give rise to personality
cults that are indistinguishable from cults of religious
hero worship. Auschwitz, the gulag and the killing fields
were not examples of what happens when human beings reject
religious dogma; they are examples of political, racial and
nationalistic dogma run amok. There is no society in human
history that ever suffered because its people became too
reasonable. <br>
<b><br>
3) Atheism is dogmatic</b>. </p>
<p>Jews, Christians and Muslims claim that their scriptures
are so prescient of humanity’s needs that they could only
have been written under the direction of an omniscient
deity. An atheist is simply a person who has considered this
claim, read the books and found the claim to be ridiculous.
One doesn’t have to take anything on faith, or be otherwise
dogmatic, to reject unjustified religious beliefs. As the
historian Stephen Henry Roberts (1901-71) once said: “I
contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one
fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss
all the other possible gods, you will understand why I
dismiss yours.” </p>
<p><b>4) Atheists think everything in the universe arose by
chanc</b>e. </p>
<p>No one knows why the universe came into being. In fact,
it is not entirely clear that we can coherently speak about
the “beginning” or “creation” of the universe at all, as
these ideas invoke the concept of time, and here we are
talking about the origin of space-time itself. </p>
<p>The notion that atheists believe that everything was
created by chance is also regularly thrown up as a criticism
of Darwinian evolution. As Richard Dawkins explains in his
marvelous book, “The God Delusion,” this represents an utter
misunderstanding of evolutionary theory. Although we don’t
know precisely how the Earth’s early chemistry begat
biology, we know that the diversity and complexity we see in
the living world is not a product of mere chance. Evolution
is a combination of chance mutation and natural selection.
Darwin arrived at the phrase “natural selection” by analogy
to the “artificial selection” performed by breeders of
livestock. In both cases, selection exerts a highly
non-random effect on the development of any species. </p>
<p><b>5) Atheism has no connection to science.</b> </p>
<p>Although it is possible to be a scientist and still
believe in God — as some scientists seem to manage it —
there is no question that an engagement with scientific
thinking tends to erode, rather than support, religious
faith. Taking the U.S. population as an example: Most polls
show that about 90% of the general public believes in a
personal God; yet 93% of the members of the National Academy
of Sciences do not. This suggests that there are few modes
of thinking less congenial to religious faith than science
is. </p>
<p><b>6) Atheists are arrogant.</b> </p>
<p>When scientists don’t know something — like why the
universe came into being or how the first self-replicating
molecules formed — they admit it. Pretending to know things
one doesn’t know is a profound liability in science. And yet
it is the life-blood of faith-based religion. One of the
monumental ironies of religious discourse can be found in
the frequency with which people of faith praise themselves
for their humility, while claiming to know facts about
cosmology, chemistry and biology that no scientist knows.
When considering questions about the nature of the cosmos
and our place within it, atheists tend to draw their
opinions from science. This isn’t arrogance; it is
intellectual honesty. </p>
<p><b>7) Atheists are closed to spiritual experience.</b>
</p>
<p>There is nothing that prevents an atheist from
experiencing love, ecstasy, rapture and awe; atheists can
value these experiences and seek them regularly. What
atheists don’t tend to do is make unjustified (and
unjustifiable) claims about the nature of reality on the
basis of such experiences. There is no question that some
Christians have transformed their lives for the better by
reading the Bible and praying to Jesus. What does this
prove? It proves that certain disciplines of attention and
codes of conduct can have a profound effect upon the human
mind. Do the positive experiences of Christians suggest that
Jesus is the sole savior of humanity? Not even remotely —
because Hindus, Buddhists, Muslims and even atheists
regularly have similar experiences. </p>
<p>There is, in fact, not a Christian on this Earth who can
be certain that Jesus even wore a beard, much less that he
was born of a virgin or rose from the dead. These are just
not the sort of claims that spiritual experience can
authenticate. </p>
<p><b>8) Atheists believe that there is nothing beyond human
life and human understanding.</b> </p>
<p>Atheists are free to admit the limits of human
understanding in a way that religious people are not. It is
obvious that we do not fully understand the universe; but it
is even more obvious that neither the Bible nor the Koran
reflects our best understanding of it. We do not know
whether there is complex life elsewhere in the cosmos, but
there might be. If there is, such beings could have
developed an understanding of nature’s laws that vastly
exceeds our own. Atheists can freely entertain such
possibilities. They also can admit that if brilliant
extraterrestrials exist, the contents of the Bible and the
Koran will be even less impressive to them than they are to
human atheists. </p>
<p>From the atheist point of view, the world’s religions
utterly trivialize the real beauty and immensity of the
universe. One doesn’t have to accept anything on
insufficient evidence to make such an observation. </p>
<p><b>9) Atheists ignore the fact that religion is extremely
beneficial to society.</b> </p>
<p>Those who emphasize the good effects of religion never
seem to realize that such effects fail to demonstrate the
truth of any religious doctrine. This is why we have terms
such as “wishful thinking” and “self-deception.” There is a
profound distinction between a consoling delusion and the
truth. </p>
<p>In any case, the good effects of religion can surely be
disputed. In most cases, it seems that religion gives people
bad reasons to behave well, when good reasons are actually
available. Ask yourself, which is more moral, helping the
poor out of concern for their suffering, or doing so because
you think the creator of the universe wants you to do it,
will reward you for doing it or will punish you for not
doing it? </p>
<p><b>10) Atheism provides no basis for morality.</b> </p>
<p>If a person doesn’t already understand that cruelty is
wrong, he won’t discover this by reading the Bible or the
Koran — as these books are bursting with celebrations of
cruelty, both human and divine. We do not get our morality
from religion. We decide what is good in our good books by
recourse to moral intuitions that are (at some level)
hard-wired in us and that have been refined by thousands of
years of thinking about the causes and possibilities of
human happiness. </p>
<p>We have made considerable moral progress over the years,
and we didn’t make this progress by reading the Bible or the
Koran more closely. Both books condone the practice of
slavery — and yet every civilized human being now recognizes
that slavery is an abomination. Whatever is good in
scripture — like the golden rule — can be valued for its
ethical wisdom without our believing that it was handed down
to us by the creator of the universe.</p>
