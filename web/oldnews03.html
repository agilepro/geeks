Here's a description: (The show was hilarious!)<br>
The Boys from The Complete Works of Shakespeare (abridged) are back with a zany, post-apocalyptic roller-coaster ride of sex, violence, murder, and miracles … The Bible! Offering answers to age-old questions (Did Moses actually look like Charlton Heston? Did Adam and Eve have navels?), this is an affectionately blasphemous, laugh-a-minute romp with a healthy dose of Holiday Season satire. The Good Book just got better!

<p><hr><H3>Wednesday, Nov. 12, 2003, ASV Social Meeting: Incorporation papers</H3>
We worked on finishing off our incorporation papers, the 1st step in getting our 501c3.<br>

<a href=http://www.garrison-martineau.com>The Garrison-Martineau Project</a></H3>
The heart of The Garrison-Martineau Project is a simple idea: 2 believers, 2 nonbelievers and a trained facilitator getting together for a few hours, sharing food and conversation.

made at our March 26 meeting about design in nature.<br>
He shared who he is and how he lives life with a foundation based on the Bible.<br>
<a href=http://www.creationism.org/articles/marriage.htm>Here is an article</a> written by Lynn.

<p><hr><H3>Saturday, July 26, 2003 at 6 PM - <a href=SFA.htm>SF Atheists meeting:</a>
"Taking Atheist Activism into Court" by Dave Kong</H3>
Dave is the California Director of American Atheists & National Award-Winning Atheist Activist<br>
How does someone develop the courage and knowledge to sue their own government for Atheist rights? Dave Kong knows.  He lived it, on his own and with others.  We heard his story of joys and frustrations of past, present and future cases.<p> Dave spoke primarily on his current lawsuit against Medicare/Medicaid payments to Christian Science sanatoria. While about a relatively small issue (compared to funding of faith-based social programs and vouchers), the precedent the case could potentially set is disturbing.

<H3>Wednesday, July 23, 2003 at 7:30 PM in Mtn. View - Home-grown ASV Panel on
"Atheism, Religion, Family, and Friends"</H3>
We heard from several of our own ASV members, in a panel moderated by Lydia.<p>
How did our fellow Atheists deal with issues such as:
<blockquote>
- Coming out to family/friends as an Atheist<br>
- What is easier now<br>
- What is harder now<br>
- What issues our panelists are currently dealing with<br>
- What useful strategies have our panelists found for dealing with these issues
</blockquote>
After the panel discussion, we opened the floor to comments, questions, and discussions.<br>
This was a a great meeting! We got to know (in person) people that many only knew from the email list, and got useful pointers on dealing with things that are going on in our own lives.

<p><hr><H3>Friday July 4, 2003 at 8:30 PM in Mtn. View - Social</h3>
We went to Shoreline park for a picnic and a stupendous view of the fireworks!

<p><hr><H3>Thursday, June 19, 2003 at 7:30 PM in Mtn. View - Our very own Deanna (Banana) Stewart spoke on Mormanism</h3>
We learned about the “Holy of Holies” in the Mormon Religion: The Temple Endowment.<br>
We saw exactly what goes on in a Mormon temple, with actual temple rituals enacted.<br>
We learned the secret handshakes that will get us through the pearly gates!<br>
We saw the Magic Morman underwear!<br>
We had a great time!

<p><hr><H3>Thursday, June 5, 2003 at 7:30 PM in Mtn. View - Social Meeting</H3>
We watched Penn and Teller videos on creationism and end of the world predictions.</H3><hr>

<H3>Thursday, May 15, 2003 at 7:30 PM in Mtn. View: 2nd anniversary pot luck dinner</h3>
People brought their favorite foods to share (even if it was potato chips or Pop Tarts). And, we watched the full eclipse of the MOON.

<p><hr><H3>Thursday, May 1, 2003, 11:15 in San Jose: We Protested the National Day of Prayer</h3>
Atheists of Silicon Valley lead a protest against the National Day of Prayer event, as we have for the last two years.<br>
This is a federally-funded annual abuse of the Constitution.<br>
It was a lot of fun, again.  We had signs to hold up, and pamphlets to hand out.<br>
After all this, we retired to the nearby Togo's for food and refreshment.<p>
May 1st is the ancient pagan Celtic holiday Beltane (Mayday).  At night on Beltane, farmers and villagers would head out into the fields and have wild sex with each other, thinking that their fertility energy would make the crops grow better, or something.  It's strange that the religious right selected this ancient day of sex and revelry as a National Day of Prayer.<br>

<p><hr><H3>Thursday, April 3, 2003 at 7:30 PM: Social Meeting in Mtn. View: Is the Moon Made of Rock or Cheese?</H3>

Presented by Barbara and Richard Lau.<p>

<hr><H3>Wednesday March 26, 2003 at 7:30 PM at Coco's at Lawrence & 101 in Sunnyvale</a>:
"Why I am an Atheist", by Mark<font color=#FFEEFF>i</font>Thomas</H3>
<b>Most people came at 6:30 to join us for dinner.</b><br>
Do you have questions about your lack of faith?<br>
Is your faithlessness being testing by the righteous, brothers (and sisters)?<br>
Do you have doubts about your doubts?<br>
Do your parents/friends/siblings think that you will soon be back among the saved?<br>
Are you afraid of backsliding?<br>
This was the talk to get your rational head back on straight.<p>
Mark showed that there are no good reasons to believe in any god, and many reasons to not believe in a god. He examined all the standard reasons for belief, and described how they collapse under the weight of science and philosophy. He then explained the advantages of Atheism and Humanism as world outlooks.

<p><hr><H3>Thursday, March 6, 2003 at 7:30: Social Meeting, in Mtn. View.</H3>

It took God six days to create the earth, and Monty Python just 90 minutes to screw it up.<br>
Plot Outline: The comedy team takes a look at life in all its stages in their own uniquely silly way.<br>

<hr><h3>Thursday, Jan. 16, 2003, Escape From the Watchtower Society</h3>
Diane Wilson told us about her story and book <a href=http://www.dianewilson.net>
Awakening of a Jehovah's Witness: Escape From the Watchtower Society</a><p>
A SPIRITUAL THRILLER!<br>
Diane Wilson, former long-time member of the Watchtower organization, has written a veritable "spiritual thriller", describing her dramatic journey to psychological freedom. She explores with frankness and passion her unfortunate servitude to the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, an organization which views itself as the sole possessor of all religious truth.<p>
The fascinated reader will be swept along emotionally as Diane details her odyssey to freedom from what most former Jehovah’s Witnesses describe as a mind-control cult. Diane spells out her initial vulnerability to the unique claims of the Watchtower Society and her fierce struggle to disengage herself from such powerfully persuasive people; in short, she reveals the dark side of Watchtower worship.<p>

<hr><H3>Sunday, Jan. 5, 2003, God Debate on the web</h3>
Dan Barker of <a href=http://www.ffrf.org/>FFRF</a> debated a Muslim on the subject <b>"DOES GOD NOT EXIST?"</b><br>
