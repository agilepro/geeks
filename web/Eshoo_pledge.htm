<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">In
a two to one decision in Newdow vs. U.S. Congress, the Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals held that the words "under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance
and a California's school district policy which requires teachers to lead
willing school children to recite the Pledge of Allegiance every day, violates
the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The
House of Representatives passed House Resolution 459 which expresses the sense
of the House that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals erroneously decided
Newdow vs. U.S. Congress. The Resolution also states that the phrase,
"one nation, under God," should remain in the Pledge of Allegiance
and that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals should agree to rehear the ruling
in order to reverse the decision.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
voted for the Resolution<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">I
believe in the separation of Church and State and that government should not
endorse religion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, I
think that in this case reciting the Pledge of Allegiance does not suppress
someone's religious or non-religious beliefs because the Pledge has become a
traditional, not religious, reference to a higher power.<o:p>
