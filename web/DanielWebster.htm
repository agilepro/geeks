<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stop it. Just quit. All these letters and commentaries </tt><br>
<tt>about "under God" and the Pledge of Allegiance and the founding </tt><br>
<tt>fathers being Christian and this being a Christian nation have just </tt><br>
<tt>got to stop. Even a Utah sculptor revises history depicting three </tt><br>
<tt>founding fathers kneeling at prayer, a scene historians call </tt><br>
<tt>unthinkable. </tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are going to argue something, get the facts
right. If you </tt><br>
<tt>want to claim that this should be a Christian nation or that you </tt><br>
<tt>believe God should be included in the pledge, the Star-Spangled </tt><br>
<tt>Banner, prayed to in all schools, then be up front and say that's </tt><br>
<tt>what you are trying to do. Don't invoke the memory of those who </tt><br>
<tt>worked so hard to keep religion and government separate. Don't claim </tt><br>
<tt>that because the founders were "Christian" that gives Christians </tt><br>
<tt>today some sort of preferential status in the country. </tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When this controversy broke out about the pledge I went
back to </tt><br>
<tt>my seminary textbook. Edwin Scott Gaustad in A Religious History of </tt><br>
<tt>America (HarperCollins, 1990) tells a fascinating account of Thomas </tt><br>
<tt>Jefferson, James Madison and Patrick Henry. In 1777, then Virginia </tt><br>
<tt>Gov. Jefferson proposed a "Bill for Establishing Religious
Freedom." </tt><br>
<tt>It would ensure that no one religion would have government approval </tt><br>
<tt>in the Commonwealth. Henry countered with his own "Bill Establishing </tt><br>
<tt>a Provision for Teachers of the Christian Religion" which would have </tt><br>
<tt>acknowledged no one denomination but would recognize Christianity as </tt><br>
<tt>the official state-sanctioned religion. </tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Jefferson's move to France as ambassador for the
new nation, </tt><br>
<tt>the cause was picked up by Madison. He argued that no religion should </tt><br>
<tt>have any established position. Henry made his case before the </tt><br>
<tt>delegates. As word of this effort spread, Baptists and Presbyterians </tt><br>
<tt>opposed it. Some thought it a ruse that would eventually favor the <span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>     </span></tt><br>
<tt>Anglicans who were a majority of the signers of the Declaration of </tt><br>
<tt>Independence. </tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madison said that not only should there be freedom of
religion in </tt><br>
<tt>the commonwealth, there should also be freedom from religion. </tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1786, Madison won. It set the stage a year later for
the </tt><br>
<tt>crafting of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. No religion </tt><br>
<tt>would have a favored status as far as the government of this new </tt><br>
<tt>nation would be concerned. </tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for calling this a Christian nation, that puzzles me.
I </tt><br>
<tt>suspect it would also puzzle George Barna. He has been researching </tt><br>
<tt>religious social trends for more than a decade. Interviewed in </tt><br>
<tt>Christianity Today (Aug. 5), he laments that most "churchgoers didn't </tt><br>
<tt>seem to have any real understanding of the Bible's distinctive </tt><br>
<tt>message; many practicing Christians believed that God helps those who </tt><br>
<tt>help themselves." The conclusion he reaches, he told interviewer Tim </tt><br>
<tt>Stafford, is that "a morally relativistic American culture was </tt><br>
<tt>shaping Christians more than Christians were shaping the culture." </tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this country were a Christian nation, its citizens
and </tt><br>
<tt>government would be working tirelessly to make sure no one went to </tt><br>
<tt>bed hungry tonight and that everyone would have a home. Universal </tt><br>
<tt>health care would be a reality and not just a political debate. </tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are curious about scriptural foundations for
these points, </tt><br>
<tt>start with the Gospel of Matthew, Chapter 25. Then go to Matthew 22 </tt><br>
<tt>where the lawyer tried to trick Jesus asking him which was the most </tt><br>
<tt>important commandment. "Love God with all your heart, all your soul </tt><br>
<tt>and all your mind, and love your neighbor as yourself," he retorted. </tt><br>
<tt>Jesus' response to that question is clearly Jewish. He quotes the </tt><br>
<tt>Torah (Deuteronomy 6:5 and Leviticus 19:18). He didn't make up </tt><br>
<tt>anything new. What is often called the "Greatest Commandment" is
not </tt><br>
<tt>uniquely Christian. </tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What has been called the "Golden Rule"
attributed to Jesus (Luke </tt><br>
<tt>6:31) can be found in some form in most major world religions. It is </tt><br>
<tt>not found in much of what this country has been doing in domestic and </tt><br>
<tt>foreign policy for too many years. </tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call it a democratic nation. Call it a republic, if you
like. </tt><br>
<tt>Call it the land of the free. </tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please don't call it a Christian nation. </tt><br>
