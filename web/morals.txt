JBH here- I've been trying to think of a good rhetorical answer to 
this. The claim is not the usual "atheists have no morals", it is 
that they have weaker morals; that religious absolutists have 
stronger, more reliable convictions than people who think for 
themselves. The reply has to be short, a sentence or two.

How about this? The religious absolutist has no morals; what they 
have is a code of obedience, which is not the same. The absolutist 
will do as they think they have been commanded, but you cannot be 
sure what that might be. They may not steal your watch, but they may 
kill you for working on Saturday. Exodus 31:14-15, Exodus 35:2.
