Having gone 'round and 'round with the personals thing, I feel inspired to offer you men some helpful tips. I swear your luck will improve if you keep these 10 points in mind. Women tend to get a much higher volume of replies, so you want to make sure you stand out in the crowd. 

When you reply to a woman's ad: 
1. Include a photo, if it's requested. Size it to 50K or under. 
2. Make sure your photo is recent (less than a year old). 
3. Do not wear sunglasses or hats in your photos. 
4. Don't send a photo of you with your arm around another woman. 
5. Do not lie about your age, or about anything else! Women appreciate honesty. 
6. Tell the woman what you liked specifically about her ad. 
7. Tell her something unique about yourself. You don't need to write a novel; you just need to stand out. Make sure to say more than "Hi, what's up?" or "I like your ad". If you don't give her anything to go on, what reason does she have to reply? 
8. Try to pay attention to your spelling and punctuation, as much as you can. This shows attention to detail, says that you're not lazy, shows that you care, and makes your reply easy to read. 
9. Don't talk about sex too much. If you two find chemistry together, there will be plenty of opportunity for sexual stuff to develop. 
10. Don't send a cut-and-paste message to every woman out there, especially if you've replied to the same ad more than once. It's very impersonal. If you have a cut-and-paste description of yourself that you like to use, write a short personal note at the top, and then tell her that you're pasting in some generic info about yourself below. 

This posting is meant to be helpful, not mean. Please don't waste your time sending angry replies to me. Good luck out there!
