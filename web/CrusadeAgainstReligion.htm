<h1 class="lg">The Crusade Against Religion</h1>
By Gary Wolf<br>Oct. 23, 2006
<p><strong>My friends, I must ask you an important question
today: Where do you stand on God?</strong>
<p>It's a question you may prefer not to be asked. But
I'm afraid I have no choice. We find ourselves, this
very autumn, three and a half centuries after the
intellectual martyrdom of Galileo, caught up in a
struggle of ultimate importance, when each one of us
must make a commitment. It is time to declare our
position.
<p>This is the challenge posed by the New Atheists. We
are called upon, we lax agnostics, we noncommittal
nonbelievers, we vague deists who would be embarrassed
to defend antique absurdities like the Virgin Birth or
the notion that Mary rose into heaven without dying, or
any other blatant myth; we are called out, we
fence-sitters, and told to help exorcise this
debilitating curse: the curse of faith.
<p>The New Atheists will not let us off the hook simply
because we are not doctrinaire believers. They condemn
not just belief in God but respect for belief in God.
Religion is not only wrong; it's evil. Now that the
battle has been joined, there's no excuse for shirking.<p>
Three writers have sounded this call to arms. They are
Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris and Daniel Dennett. A few
months ago, I set out to talk with them. I wanted to
find out what it would mean to enlist in the war against
faith.
<p><strong>Oxford is the capital</strong> of reason, its
Jerusalem. The walls glint gold in the late afternoon,
as waves or particles of light scatter off the ancient
bricks. Logic Lane, a tiny road under a low,
right-angled bridge, cuts sharply across to the place
where Robert Boyle formulated his law on gases and
Robert Hooke first used a microscope to see a living
cell. A few steps away is the memorial to Percy Bysshe
Shelley. Here he lies, sculpted naked in stone, behind
the walls of the university that expelled him almost 200
years ago -- for atheism.
<p>Richard Dawkins, the leading light of the New Atheism
movement, lives and works in a large brick house just 20
minutes away from the Shelley memorial. Dawkins,
formerly a fellow at New College, is the Charles Simonyi
Professor of the Public Understanding of Science. He is
65 years old, and the book that made him famous, <cite>
The Selfish Gene</cite>, dates from well back in the
last century. The opposition it earned from rival
theorizers and popularizers of Charles Darwin, such as
Stephen Jay Gould, is fading into history. Gould died in
2002, and Dawkins, while acknowledging their battles,
praised his influence on scientific culture. They were
allies in the battle against creationism. Dawkins,
however, has been far more belligerent in counterattack.
His most recent book is called <cite>The God Delusion</cite>.
<p>Dawkins' style of debate is as maddening as it is
reasonable. A few months earlier, in front of an
audience of graduate students from around the world,
Dawkins took on a famous geneticist and a renowned
neurosurgeon on the question of whether God was real.
The geneticist and the neurosurgeon advanced their best
theistic arguments: Human consciousness is too
remarkable to have evolved; our moral sense defies the
selfish imperatives of nature; the laws of science
themselves display an order divine; the existence of God
can never be disproved by purely empirical means.
<p>Dawkins rejected all these claims, but the last one
-- that science could never disprove God -- provoked him
to sarcasm. "There's an infinite number of things that
we can't disprove," he said. "You might say that because
science can explain just about everything but not quite,
it's wrong to say therefore we don't need God. It is
also, I suppose, wrong to say we don't need the Flying
Spaghetti Monster, unicorns, Thor, Wotan, Jupiter, or
fairies at the bottom of the garden. There's an infinite
number of things that some people at one time or another
have believed in, and an infinite number of things that
nobody has believed in. If there's not the slightest
reason to believe in any of those things, why bother?
The onus is on somebody who says, I want to believe in
God, Flying Spaghetti Monster, fairies, or whatever it
is. It is not up to us to disprove it."
<p>Science, after all, is an empirical endeavor that
traffics in probabilities. The probability of God,
Dawkins says, while not zero, is vanishingly small. He
is confident that no Flying Spaghetti Monster exists.
Why should the notion of some deity that we inherited
from the Bronze Age get more respectful treatment?
<p>Dawkins has been talking this way for years, and his
best comebacks are decades old. For instance, the Flying
Spaghetti Monster is a variant of the tiny orbiting
teapot used by Bertrand Russell for similar rhetorical
duty back in 1952. Dawkins is perfectly aware that
atheism is an ancient doctrine and that little of what
he has to say is likely to change the terms of this
stereotyped debate. But he continues to go at it. His
true interlocutors are not the Christians he confronts
directly but the wavering nonbelievers or quasi
believers among his listeners -- people like me,
potential New Atheists who might be inspired by his
example.
<p>"I'm quite keen on the politics of persuading people
of the virtues of atheism," Dawkins says, after we get
settled in one of the high-ceilinged, ground-floor
rooms. He asks me to keep an eye on his bike, which sits
just behind him, on the other side of a window
overlooking the street. "The number of nonreligious
people in the U.S. is something nearer to 30 million
than 20 million," he says. "That's more than all the
Jews in the world put together. I think we're in the
same position the gay movement was in a few decades ago.
There was a need for people to come out. The more people
who came out, the more people had the courage to come
out. I think that's the case with atheists. They are
more numerous than anybody realizes."
<p>Dawkins looks forward to the day when the first U.S.
politician is honest about being an atheist. "Highly
intelligent people are mostly atheists," he says. "Not a
single member of either house of Congress admits to
being an atheist. It just doesn't add up. Either they're
stupid, or they're lying. And have they got a motive for
lying? Of course they've got a motive! Everybody knows
that an atheist can't get elected."
<p>When atheists finally begin to gain some power, what
then? Here is where Dawkins' analogy breaks down. Gay
politics is strictly civil rights: Live and let live.
But the atheist movement, by his lights, has no choice
but to aggressively spread the good news. Evangelism is
a moral imperative. Dawkins does not merely disagree
with religious myths. He disagrees with tolerating them,
with cooperating in their colonization of the brains of
innocent tykes.
<p>"How much do we regard children as being the property
of their parents?" Dawkins asks. "It's one thing to say
people should be free to believe whatever they like, but
should they be free to impose their beliefs on their
children? Is there something to be said for society
stepping in? What about bringing up children to believe
manifest falsehoods?"
<p>Dawkins is the inventor of the concept of the meme,
that is, a cultural replicator that spreads from brain
to brain, like a virus. Dawkins is also a believer in
democracy. He understands perfectly well that there are
practical constraints on controlling the spread of bad
memes. If the solution to the spread of wrong ideas and
contagious superstitions is a totalitarian commissariat
that would silence believers, then the cure is worse
than the disease. But such constraints are no excuse for
the weak-minded pretense that religious viruses are
trivial, much less benign. Bad ideas foisted on children
are moral wrongs. We should think harder about how to
stop them.
<p>It is exactly this trip down Logic Lane, this
conscientious deduction of conclusions from premises,
that makes Dawkins' proclamations a torment to his
moderate allies. While frontline warriors against
creationism are busy reassuring parents and legislators
that teaching Darwin's theory does not undermine the
possibility of religious devotion, Dawkins is openly
agreeing with the most stubborn fundamentalists that
evolution must lead to atheism. I tell Dawkins what he
already knows: He is making life harder for his friends.
<p>He barely shrugs. "Well, it's a cogent point, and I
have to face that. My answer is that the big war is not
between evolution and creationism, but between
naturalism and supernaturalism. The sensible" -- and
here he pauses to indicate that <em>sensible</em> should
be in quotes -- "the 'sensible' religious people are
really on the side of the fundamentalists, because they
believe in supernaturalism. That puts me on the other
side."
<p><strong>Three years ago</strong>, Dawkins adopted a
new word to demarcate the types of things he couldn't
believe in. The word is <em>bright</em>, a noun. Coined
by Sacramento, California, educators Paul Geisert and
Mynga Futrell to designate a person with a naturalistic
worldview, <em>bright</em> was designed to be broader
than the atheist movement; it is not merely God that is
untenable, but superstition, credulity and magical
thinking in general. Dawkins happened to be present in
the spring of 2003 when Geisert and Futrell unveiled
their proposal at an atheist conference in Florida, and
he subsequently issued a public call in <cite>The
Guardian</cite> and in <cite>Wired</cite> urging its
use. The monthly Brights' meetup in London is among the
largest. The main organizer, Glen Slade, is a
41-year-old entrepreneur who studied computer science at
the University of Cambridge and management at Insead,
Europe's leading business school. Slade points out that
political developments in Europe and the U.S. have
created new opportunities for consciousness-raising.
"The war on terror wakes people up to the fact that
there is more than one religion in the world," Slade
says. "I think we're at a crucial point, when we admit
that certain types of religion are incompatible with
certain rights. At what point does society say, 'Hey,
that's insane'?"
<p>Like Dawkins, Slade rejects those who might once have
been his allies: agnostics and liberal believers, the
type of people who may go to church but who are
skeptical of doctrine. "Moderates give a power base to
extremists," Slade says. "A lot of Catholics use
condoms, a lot of Catholics are divorced, and a lot
don't have a particular opinion about whether you are
homosexual. But when the Pope stands up and says, 'This
is what Catholics believe,' he still gets credit for
speaking for more than a billion people."
<p>Now that people are more worried about the fatwas of
Muslim clerics, Slade says, this concern could spread,
become more general, and wake people up to damage caused
by the Pope.
<p>For the New Atheists, the problem is not any specific
doctrine, but religion in general. Or, as Dawkins writes
in <cite>The God Delusion</cite>, "As long as we accept
the principle that religious faith must be respected
simply because it is religious faith, it is hard to
withhold respect from the faith of Osama bin Laden and
the suicide bombers."
<p>The New Atheist insight is that one might start
anywhere -- with an intellectual argument, with a
visceral rejection of Islamic or Christian
fundamentalism, with political disgust -- and then, by
relentless and logical steps, renounce every
supernatural crutch.
<p><strong>I return from Oxford</strong> enthusiastic
for argument. I immediately begin trying out Dawkins'
appeal in polite company. At dinner parties or over
drinks, I ask people to declare themselves. "Who here is
an atheist?" I ask.
<p>Usually, the first response is silence, accompanied
by glances all around in the hope that somebody else
will speak first. Then, after a moment, somebody does,
almost always a man, almost always with a defiant smile
and a tone of enthusiasm. He says happily, "I am!"
<p>But it is the next comment that is telling. Somebody
turns to him and says: "You would be."
<p>"Why?"
<p>"Because you enjoy pissing people off."
<p>"Well, that's true."
<p>This type of conversation takes place not in central
Ohio, where I was born, or in Utah, where I was a
teenager, but on the West Coast, among technical and
scientific people, possibly the social group that is
least likely among all Americans to be religious. Most
of these people call themselves agnostic, but they don't
harbor much suspicion that God is real. They tell me
they reject atheism not out of piety but out of
politeness. As one said, "Atheism is like telling
somebody, 'The very thing you hinge your life on, I
totally dismiss.'" This is the type of statement she
would never want to make.
<p>This is the statement the New Atheists believe must
be made -- loudly, clearly and before it's too late. I
continue to invite my friends for a nice, invigorating
stroll down Logic Lane. For the most part, they just
laugh and wave me on.
<p><strong>As I test out</strong> the New Atheist
arguments, I realize that the problem with logic is that
it doesn't quicken the blood sufficiently -- even my
own. But if logic by itself won't do the trick, how
about the threat of apocalypse? The apocalyptic argument
for atheism is the province of Sam Harris, who released
a book two years ago called <cite>The End of Faith:
Religion Terror, and the Future of Reason</cite>.
<p>Harris argues that, unless we renounce faith,
religious violence will soon bring civilization to an
end. Between 2004 and 2006, his book sold more than a
quarter million copies.
<p>This autumn, Harris has a new book out, <cite>Letter
to a Christian Nation</cite>. In it, he demonstrates the
behavior he believes atheists should adopt when talking
with Christians. "Nonbelievers like myself stand beside
you," he writes, addressing his imaginary opponent,
"dumbstruck by the Muslim hordes who chant death to
whole nations of the living. But we stand dumbstruck by
<em>you</em> as well -- by your denial of tangible
reality, by the suffering you create in service to your
religious myths, and by your attachment to an imaginary
God."
<p>In midsummer, Harris and I overlap for a few days in
Southern California, so we arrange to meet for lunch. I
am not looking for more atheist arguments. I am already
steeped in them. I have by now read my David Hume, my
Bertrand Russell, even my Shelley. I want to talk to
Harris about emotion, about politics, about his
conviction that the days of civilization are numbered
unless we renounce irrational belief. Given the way
things are going, I want to know if he is depressed. Is
he preparing for the end?
<p>He is not. "Look at slavery," he says. We are at a
beautiful restaurant in Santa Monica, near the public
lots from which Americans -- nearly 80 percent of whom
believe the Bible is the true word of God, if polls are
correct -- walk happily down to the beach in various
states of undress. "People used to think," Harris says,
"that slavery was morally acceptable. The most
intelligent, sophisticated people used to accept that
you could kidnap whole families, force them to work for
you, and sell their children. That looks ridiculous to
us today. We're going to look back and be amazed that we
approached this asymptote of destructive capacity while
allowing ourselves to be balkanized by fantasy. What
seems quixotic <em>is</em> quixotic -- on this side of a
radical change. From the other side, you can't believe
it didn't happen earlier. At some point, there is going
to be enough pressure that it is just going to be too
<em>embarrassing</em> to believe in God."
<p>Suddenly I notice in myself a protective feeling
toward Harris. Here is a man who believes that a great
global change, perhaps the most important cultural
change in the history of humanity, will occur out of
sheer intellectual embarrassment.
<p>We discuss what it might look like, this world
without God. "There would be a religion of reason,"
Harris says. "We would have realized the rational means
to maximize human happiness. We may all agree that we
want to have a Sabbath that we take really seriously --
a lot more seriously than most religious people take it.
But it would be a rational decision, and it would not be
just because it's in the Bible. We would be able to
invoke the power of poetry and ritual and silent
contemplation and all the variables of happiness so that
we could exploit them. Call it prayer, but we would have
prayer without bullshit."
<p>I do call it prayer. Here is the atheist prayer: that
our reason will subjugate our superstition, that our
intelligence will check our illusions, that we will be
able to hold at bay the evil temptation of faith.
<p><strong>That week</strong> in Los Angeles it is very
hot. Temperatures in the San Fernando Valley, where I'm
staying, set a record at 119. Intermittent power
failures kill the lights, and the region is bathed in an
old-fashioned brown smog that blurs the outlines of the
trees. In the evening, as it cools to 102, I decide to
enter the emplacements of the adversary.
<p>I am headed for the Angelus Temple, in Echo Park. A
landmark of modern Christianity, it is one of the
original churches of the surging charismatic movement.
It is not the richest church, nor the most powerful, nor
the most famous. But Angelus, founded by Aimee Semple
McPherson in the 1920s, pioneered that combination of
high production values and uplifting theology that began
to purge the stain of hickdom from evangelical faith.
Aside from being a historical shrine, the Angelus Temple
is a case study in religious evolution. While the New
Atheists are arming themselves against faith, faith
itself renews its arms. Superstition, it turns out, is a
moving target.
<p>In 2001, a merger with a thriving church downtown,
run by the young son of a powerful pastor in Phoenix,
brought renewal -- not merely in the form of massive
social outreach and volunteer programs, youth events and
Bible study groups, but also, as the church explains on
its website, in the form of "new cushioned theater
seats, Ferrari-red carpet, modern stainless steel
fixtures and acoustical absorbers hung decoratively from
the ceiling similar to the Royal Albert Hall in
England."
<p>It is Saturday night, and I am greeted at the door by
a blast of air-conditioning and a wave of sound. It
looks like a rock concert. It is a rock concert. More
than 500 teenagers are crowding the stage, hands
uplifted, singing along. There is a 12-member band, four
huge videoscreens, and a crane that allows the camera to
swoop through the air, projecting images of the
believers back to themselves.
<p>"How many people are excited to give to the Lord
tonight?" asks a young man who saunters up to the front.
He handles his microphone naturally; he is not
self-conscious. "How many people are pumped up? You have
a destiny. God has a plan. But you have got to sow some
seeds tonight, or it is never going to happen." Text
flashes across the overhead screens, telling the
teenagers how to make out their checks.
<p>Behind the lighting rigs and the acoustic panels,
stained glass peeks out, a relic of McPherson's era.
McPherson was personally wild and doctrinally flexible.
She had visions and spoke in tongues, but she tried to
put aside sectarian disputes. Even today, the
charismatic movement is somewhat careless of doctrine.
There is room for theistic evolutionists, for
nonliteralists who hold that each of God's days in
Genesis was the equivalent of a geological epoch, even
for the notion that a check made out properly to the
Lord can influence divine whim in the matter of a raise
at work or a scholarship to college. Of course,
evolutionary accommodation is controversial in the
seminaries, and the idea of bribing God is rank heresy
-- no trained theologian in any Christian tradition
would endorse it. But such deviations are generously
tolerated in practice. The forces at work in a living
church have little to do with intellectual disputes over
the meaning of the Lord's word. Having agreed that the
Bible is inerrant, one is permitted to put it to use.
<p>This use is supremely practical. Pastor Matthew
Barnett, onstage, wears the uniform of America -- jeans
with loafers, a short-sleeved knit shirt. It's one of
the costumes Kanye West wore on his Touch the Sky Tour,
the same costume kids put on to go fold clothes at the
mall. Like Kanye, like the kids at the mall, like
millions of sober alcoholics, like Jesus, Pastor Matt --
as he's called -- does not traffic in proofs. Instead he
tells stories. For instance, Pastor Matt used to be fat.
Every night at 10 p.m., it was off to an orgy of junk
food at Jack in the Box. Two monster tacos, curly fries,
a chocolate shake. He was programmed. He was helpless.
He could not resist. "The devil is a lion seeking whom
he may devour," Pastor Matt says. On the other hand,
strength to resist temptation is an explicit promise
from the Lord. Let us read from 1 Corinthians: <em>God
is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above
that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make
a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it</em>.
<p>Anybody who has ever been a teenager will recognize
the relevance of Pastor Matt's sermon. These are the
years of confusion, temptation, struggles with
self-control. Pastor Matt openly shares with the
teenagers the great humiliation he faced when trying to
lose weight. The pastor is trim and handsome now. He
talks intimately with the teenagers about food, about
sex, about drugs. He boosts them up. He helps them cope
with their shame. He tells them that they are kings
anointed by God, that they simply need to pray, and have
faith, and be honest, and express their vulnerability,
and work hard, and if they do these things they are
guaranteed their reward.
<p>When he calls them to the stage, hundreds go. He puts
his hands on their heads, and some cry. The altar call
is a moving spectacle, and even we adults, we readers of
Dawkins and Harris, we practiced reasoners and sincere
pilgrims on the path of nonbelief, may find something in
it that makes sense. Notwithstanding the banality of the
doctrine, its canned anecdotes, and its questionable
fundraising, Pastor Matthew offers a gift to his flock.
They sow their seeds, and he blesses them. It is a
direct exchange.
<p><strong>The next morning</strong>, I seek to cleanse
my intellectual conscience among the freethinkers. The
Center for Inquiry is also a storied landmark. True, it
is not as striking as the Angelus Temple, being only a
bland, low structure at the far end of Hollywood
Boulevard, miles away from the tourists. But this
building is the West Coast branch of one of the greatest
anti-supernatural organizations in the world. My
favorite thing about the Center for Inquiry is that it
is affiliated with the Committee for the Scientific
Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, founded 30
years ago by Isaac Asimov, Paul Kurtz and Carl Sagan and
dedicated to spreading misery among every species of
quack.
<p>I have become a connoisseur of atheist groups --
there are scores of them, mostly local, linked into a
few larger networks. There are some tensions, as is
normal in the claustrophobia of powerless subcultures,
but relations among the different branches of the
movement are mostly friendly. Typical atheists are
hardly the rabble-rousing evangelists that Dawkins or
Harris might like. They are an older, peaceable, quietly
frustrated lot, who meet partly out of idealism and
partly out of loneliness. Here in Los Angeles, every
fourth Sunday at 11 a.m., there is a meeting of Atheists
United. More than 50 people have shown up today, which
is a very good turnout for atheism. Many are approaching
retirement age. The speaker this morning, a younger
activist named Clark Adams, encourages them with the
idea that their numbers are growing. Look at <cite>South
Park</cite>, Adams urges. Look at Howard Stern. Look at
Penn &amp; Teller. These are signs of an infidel upsurge.
<p>Still, Adams admits some marketing concerns. Atheists
are predominant among the "upper 5 percent," he says.
"Where we're lagging is among the lower 95 percent."
<p>This is a true problem, and it goes beyond the
difficulty of selling your ideas among those to whom you
so openly condescend. The sociologist Rodney Stark has
argued that the rise and fall of religions can be
understood in economic terms. Believers sacrifice time
and money in exchange for both spiritual and material
benefits. In other words, religion is rational, but it
is governed by the rationality of trade rather than of
argument. Stark's theory is academically controversial,
but here, in the Sunday morning meeting of Atheists
United, it seems obvious that the narrow reasonableness
of Adams can hardly be effective with the deal on offer
at the Angelus Temple.
<p>"We're lagging among the lower 95 percent," says
Adams.
<p>"You are kings anointed by God," says Pastor Matt.
<p>As the tide of faith rises, atheists, who have no
church to buoy them, cling to one another. That a single
celebrity, say, Keanu Reeves, is known to care nothing
about God is counted as a victory. This parochial and
moralistic self-regard begins to inspire in me a feeling
of oppression. When Adams starts to recite the names of
atheists who may have contributed to the television
program <cite>Mr. Show With Bob and David</cite> between
1995 and 1998, I leave. Standing in the half-empty
parking lot is a relief, though I am drenched from the
heat.
<p><strong>My pilgrimage</strong> is about to become
more difficult. On the one hand, it is obvious that the
political prospects of the New Atheism are slight.
People see a contradiction in its tone of certainty.
Contemptuous of the faith of others, its proponents
never doubt their own belief. They are fundamentalists.
I hear this protest dozens of times. It comes up in
every conversation. Even those who might side with the
New Atheists are repelled by their strident tone. (The
founders of the Brights, Geisert and Futrell, became
grim at the mention of Sam Harris. "We don't endorse
anything from him," Geisert said. We had talked for
nearly three hours, and this was the only dark cloud.)
The New Atheists never propose realistic solutions to
the damage religion can cause. For instance, the
Catholic Church opposes condom use, which makes it
complicit in the spread of AIDS. But among the most
powerful voices against this tragic mistake are liberals
within the Church -- exactly those allies the New
Atheists reject. The New Atheists care mainly about
correct belief. This makes them hopeless, politically.
<p>But on the other hand, the New Atheism does not aim
at success by conventional political means. It does not
balance interests, it does not make compromises, it does
not seek common ground. The New Atheism, outwardly at
least, is a straightforward appeal to our intellect.
Atheists make their stand upon the truth.
<p>So is atheism true?
<p>There's good evidence from research by
anthropologists such as Pascal Boyer and Scott Atran
that a grab bag of cognitive predispositions makes us
natural believers. We hear leaves rustle and we imagine
that some airy being flutters up there; we see a corpse
and continue to fear the judgment and influence of the
person it once was. Remarkable progress has been made in
understanding why faith is congenial to human nature --
and of course that still says nothing about whether it
is true. Harris is typically severe in his rejection of
the idea that evolutionary history somehow justifies
faith. There is, he writes, "nothing more natural than
rape. But no one would argue that rape is good, or
compatible with a civil society, because it may have had
evolutionary advantages for our ancestors." Like rape,
Harris says, religion may be a vestige of our primitive
nature that we must simply overcome.
<p>A variety of rebuttals to atheism have been tried
over the years. Religious fundamentalists stand on their
canonized texts and refuse to budge. The wisdom of this
approach -- strategically, at least -- is evident when
you see the awkward positions nonfundamentalists find
themselves in. The most active defender of faith among
scientists right now is Francis Collins, head of the
Human Genome Project. His most recent book is called
<cite>The Language of God: A Scientist Presents Evidence
for Belief</cite>. In defiance of the title, Collins
never attempts to show that science offers evidence for
belief. Rather, he argues only that nothing in science
<em>prohibits</em> belief. Unsolved problems in diverse
fields, along with a skepticism about knowledge in
general, are used to demonstrate that a deity might not
be impossible. The problem with this, for defenders of
faith, is that they've implicitly accepted science as
the arbiter of what is real. This leaves the atheists
with the upper hand.
<p>That's because when secular investigations take the
lead, sacred doctrines collapse. There's barely a field
of modern research -- cosmology, biology, archaeology,
anthropology, psychology -- in which competing religious
explanations have survived unscathed. Even the lowly
humanities, which began the demolition job more than 200
years ago with textual criticism of the Bible, continue
to make things difficult for believers through careful
analysis of the historical origins of religious texts.
While Collins and his fellow reconcilers can defend the
notion of faith in the abstract, as soon as they get
down to doctrine, the secular professors show up with
their corrosive arguments. When it comes to concrete
examples of exactly what we should believe, reason is a
slippery slope, and at the bottom -- well, at the bottom
is atheism.
<p>I spend months resisting this slide. I turn to the
great Oxford professor of science and religion, John
Hedley Brooke, who convinces me that, contrary to myth,
Darwin did not become an atheist because of evolution.
Instead, his growing resistance to Christianity came
from his moral criticism of 19th-century doctrine,
compounded by the tragedy of his daughter's death.
Darwin did not believe that evolution proved there was
no God. This is interesting, because the story of
Darwin's relationship to Christianity has figured in
polemics for and against evolution for more than a
century. But in the context of a real struggle with the
claims of atheism, an accurate history of Darwin's loss
of faith counts for little more than celebrity gossip.
<p>From Brooke, I get pointers on the state of the art
in academic theology, particularly those philosophers of
religion who write in depth about science, such as
Willem Drees and Philip Clayton. There is a certain
illicit satisfaction in this scholarly work, which to an
atheist is no better than astrology. ("The entire thrust
of my position is that Christian theology is a
nonsubject," Dawkins has written. "Vacuous. Devoid of
coherence or content.") On the contrary, I find the best
of these books to be brilliant, detailed, self-assured.
I learn about <em>kenosis</em>, the deliberate decision
of God not to disturb the natural order. I learn about
<em>panentheism</em>, which says God is both the world
and more than the world, and about <em>emergentist
theology</em>, which holds that a God might have
evolved. There are deep passages surveying theories of
knowledge, glossing Kant, Schelling and Spinoza. I
discover a daunting diversity of belief, and of course
I'm just beginning. I haven't even gotten started with
Islam, or the Vedic texts, or Zoroastrianism. It is all
admirable and stimulating and lacks only the real help
anybody in my position would need: reasons to believe
that specific religious ideas are true. Even the most
careful theologians seem to pose the question backward,
starting out with their beliefs and clinging to those
fragments that science and logic cannot overturn. The
most rigorous of them jettison huge portions of doctrine
along the way.
<p>If trained theologians can go this far, who am I to
defend supernaturalism on their behalf? Why <em>not</em>
be an atheist? I've sought aid far and wide, from Echo
Park to Harvard, and finally I am almost ready to give
in. Only one thing is still bothering me. Were I to
declare myself an atheist, what would this mean? Would
my life have to change? Would it become my moral
obligation to be uncompromising toward fence-sitting
friends? That person at dinner, pissing people off with
his arrogance, his disrespect, his intellectual scorn --
would that be me?
<p>Besides, do we really understand all that religion
means? Would it be easy to excise it, even assuming it
is false? Didn't they try a cult of reason once, in
France, at the close of the 18th century, and didn't it
turn out to be too ugly <em>even for Robespierre</em>?
<p><strong>The doctor</strong> for these difficulties
looks like Santa Claus. His name is Daniel Dennett. He
is a renowned philosopher, an atheist, and the possessor
of a full white beard. I suspect he must have designed
this Father Christmas look intentionally, but in fact it
just evolved. "In the '60s, I looked like Rasputin," he
says. Children have come up to him in airports, checking
to see if he is on vacation from the North Pole. When it
happens, he does not torment them with knowledge that
the person they mistake him for is not real. Instead,
the philosopher puts his fingers to his lips and says
conspiratorially: "Shhhh."
<p>Dennett summers on a farm in Maine. Flying in, I have
a fine view of the old New England tapestry, which grows
more and more rural as we move north: symmetrical fields
with pale borders like the membranes of cells, barns and
outbuildings like organelles, and, at the center of
every thickening cluster of life, always the same
vestigial structure, whose black dot of a cupola is
offset by a whitish gleam. I know something of the
history of the New England church, which began in
fanaticism and ended in reform -- from witch burning to
softest Presbyterianism in a few hundred years. Now,
according to the atheists, these structures serve no
useful purpose, and besides, they may be conduits for
disease. Perhaps it is best that we do away with them
all. But can it be done without harm?
<p>Among the New Atheists, Dennett holds an exalted but
ambiguous place. Like Dawkins and Harris, he is an
evangelizing nonbeliever. He has campaigned in writing
on behalf of the Brights and has written a book called
<cite>Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural
Phenomenon</cite>. In it, the blasting rhetoric of
Dawkins and Harris is absent, replaced by provocative,
often humorous examples and thought experiments. But
like the other New Atheists, Dennett gives no quarter to
believers who resist subjecting their faith to
scientific evaluation. In fact, he argues that neutral,
scientifically informed education about every religion
in the world should be mandatory in school. After all,
he argues, "if you have to hoodwink -- or blindfold --
your children to ensure that they confirm their faith
when they are adults, your faith <em>ought</em> to go
extinct."
<p>When I arrive at the farm, I find him in the midst of
a difficult task. He has been asked by the President's
Council on Bioethics to write an essay reflecting on
human dignity. In grappling with these issues, Dennett
knows that he can't rely on faith or scripture. He will
not say that life begins when an embryo is ensouled by
God. He will not say that hospitals must not invite the
indigent to sell their bodies for medical experiments
because humans are endowed by their creator with
inalienable rights. Ethical problems must be solved by
reason, not arbitrary rules. And yet, on the other hand,
Dennett knows that reason alone will fail.
<p>We sit in his study, in some creaky chairs, with the
deep silence of an August morning around us, and Dennett
tells me that he takes very seriously the risk of
overreliance on thought. He doesn't want people to lose
confidence in what he calls their "default settings," by
which he means the conviction that their ethical
intuitions are trustworthy. These default settings give
us a feeling of security, a belief that our own
sacrifices will be reciprocated. "If you shatter this
confidence," he says, "then you get into a deep hole.
Without trust, everything goes wrong."
<p>It interests me that, though Dennett is an atheist,
he does not see faith merely as a useless vestige of our
primitive nature, something we can, with effort,
intellectualize away. No rational creature, he says,
would be able to do without unexamined, sacred things.
<p>"Would intelligent robots be religious?" it occurs to
me to ask.
<p>"Perhaps they would," he answers thoughtfully.
"Although, if they were intelligent enough to evaluate
their own programming, they would eventually question
their belief in God."
<p>Dennett is an advocate of admitting that we simply
don't have good reasons for some of the things we
believe. Although we must guard our defaults, we still
have to admit that they may be somewhat arbitrary. "How
else do we protect ourselves?" he asks. "With
absolutisms? This means telling lies, and when the lies
are exposed, the crash is worse. It's not that science
can discover when the body is ensouled. That's nonsense.
We are not going to tolerate infanticide. But we're not
going to put people in jail for onanism. Instead of
protecting stability with a brittle set of myths, we can
defend a deep resistance to mucking with the
boundaries."
<p>This sounds to me a little like the religion of
reason that Harris foresees.
<p>"Yes, there could be a rational religion," Dennett
says. "We could have a rational policy not even to think
about certain things." He understands that this would
create constant tension between prohibition and
curiosity. But the borders of our sacred beliefs could
be well guarded simply by acknowledging that it is
pragmatic to refuse to change them.
<p>I ask Dennett if there might not be a contradiction
in his scheme. On the one hand, he aggressively
confronts the faithful, attacking their sacred beliefs.
On the other hand, he proposes that our inherited
defaults be put outside the limits of dispute. But this
would make our defaults into a religion, unimpeachable
and implacable gods. And besides, are we not atheists?
Sacred prohibitions are anathema to us.
<p>Dennett replies that exceptions can be made.
"Philosophers are the ones who refuse to accept the
sacred values," he says. For instance, Socrates.
<p>I find this answer supremely odd. The image of an
atheist religion whose sacred objects, called defaults,
are taboo for all except philosophers -- this is the
material of the cruelest parody. But that's not what
Dennett means. In his scenario, the philosophers are not
revered authorities but mental risk-takers and scouts.
Their adventures invite ridicule, or worse.
"Philosophers should expect to be hooted at and
reviled," Dennett says. "Socrates drank the hemlock. He
knew what he was doing."
<p>With this, I begin to understand what kind of atheist
I want to be. Dennett's invocation of Socrates is a
reminder that there are certain actors in history who
change the world by staging their own defeat. Having
been raised under Christianity, we are well schooled in
this tactic of belated victory. The world has reversed
its judgment on Socrates, as on Jesus and the fanatical
John Brown. All critics of fundamental values, even
those who have no magical beliefs, will find themselves
tempted to retrace this path. Dawkins' tense rhetoric of
moral choice, Harris' vision of apocalypse, their
contempt for liberals, the invocation of slavery -- this
is not the language of intellectual debate but of
prophecy.
<p>In <cite>Breaking the Spell</cite>, Dennett writes
about the personal risk inherent in attacking faith.
Harris veils his academic affiliation and hometown
because he fears for his physical safety. But in truth,
the cultural neighborhoods where they live and work bear
little resemblance to Italy under Pope Urban VIII, or
New England in the 17th century, or Saudi Arabia today.
Dennett spends the academic year at Tufts University and
summers with family and students in Maine. Dawkins
occupies an endowed Oxford chair and walks his dog on
the wide streets, alone. Harris sails forward this fall
with his second well-publicized book. There have been no
fatwas, no prison cells, no gallows or crosses.
<p>Prophecy, I've come to realize, is a complex meme.
When prophets provoke real trouble, bring confusion to
society by sowing reverberant doubts, spark an active,
opposing consensus everywhere -- that is the sign
they've hit a nerve. But what happens when they don't
hit a nerve? There are plenty of would-be prophets in
the world, vainly peddling their provocative claims.
Most of them just end up lecturing to undergraduates, or
leading little Christian sects, or getting into
Wikipedia edit wars, or boring their friends. An
unsuccessful prophet is not a martyr, but a sort of
clown.
<p>Where does this leave us, we who have been called
upon to join this uncompromising war against faith? What
shall we do, we potential enlistees? Myself, I've
decided to refuse the call. The irony of the New Atheism
-- this prophetic attack on prophecy, this extremism in
opposition to extremism -- is too much for me.
<p>The New Atheists have castigated fundamentalism and
branded even the mildest religious liberals as enablers
of a vengeful mob. Everybody who does not join them is
an ally of the Taliban. But, so far, their provocation
has failed to take hold. Given all the religious trauma
in the world, I take this as good news. Even those of us
who sympathize intellectually have good reasons to wish
that the New Atheists continue to seem absurd. If we
reject their polemics, if we continue to have respectful
conversations even about things we find ridiculous, this
doesn't necessarily mean we've lost our convictions or
our sanity. It simply reflects our deepest, democratic
values. Or, you might say, our bedrock faith: the faith
that no matter how confident we are in our beliefs,
there's always a chance we could turn out to be wrong.
