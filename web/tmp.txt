Hi,

Thanks for watching the video.

I did it for the most simple of reasons; I can get another copy of a movie that I like, "The God Who Wasn't There."  (see http://www.BlasphemyChallenge.com and http://www.thegodmovie.com )  You would likely find it quite interesting, as it does an entertaining job of laying out the simple fact that there's not a single bit of reliable historical evidence that Jesus ever even existed.

All the best,
Mark
