<p>ROME — Every patient in the cardiac care unit at the
San Filippo Neri Hospital who survives a heart attack
goes home with a prescription for purified fish oil, or
omega-3 fatty acids.</div>

“It is clearly recommended in international guidelines,”
said Dr. Massimo Santini, the hospital’s chief of
cardiology, who added that it would be considered
tantamount to
<a title="Recent and archival health news about medical malpractice." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/malpractice/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">
malpractice</a> in Italy to omit the drug.<p>In a large
number of studies, prescription fish oil has been shown
to improve survival after heart attacks and to reduce
fatal heart rhythms. The American College of Cardiology
recently strengthened its position on the medical
benefit of fish oil, although some critics say that
studies have not defined the magnitude of the effect.
<p>But in the United States, heart attack victims are
not generally given omega-3 fatty acids, even as they
are routinely offered more expensive and invasive
treatments, like pills to lower
<a title="Recent and archival health news about cholesterol." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/cholesterol/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">
cholesterol</a> or implantable
<a title="Recent and archival health news about defibrillators." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/defibrillators/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">
defibrillators</a>. Prescription fish oil, sold under
the brand name Omacor, is not even approved by the
<a title="More articles about the U.S. Food And Drug Administration." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/f/food_and_drug_administration/index.html?inline=nyt-org">
Food and Drug Administration</a> for use in heart
patients.
<p>“Most cardiologists here are not giving omega-3’s
even though the data supports it — there’s a real
disconnect,” said Dr. Terry Jacobson, a preventive
cardiologist at
<a title="More articles about Emory University" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/e/emory_university/index.html?inline=nyt-org">
Emory University</a> in Atlanta. “They have been very
slow to incorporate the therapy.”
<p>The fact that heart patients receive such different
treatments in sophisticated hospitals around the world
highlights the central role that drug companies play in
disseminating medical information, experts said.
<p>Because prescription fish oil is not licensed to
prevent
<a title="Recent and archival health news about heart disease." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/heartdisease/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">
heart disease</a> in the United States, drug companies
may not legally promote it for that purpose at
conferences, in doctors’ offices, to patients or even on
the Internet.
<p>“If people paid more attention to guidelines, more
people would be on the drug,” Dr. Jacobson said. “But
pharmaceutical companies can’t drive this change. The
fact that it’s not licensed for this has definitely kept
doctors away.”
<p>For example, on Solvay Pharmaceutical’s Web site for
Omacor, <a href="http://www.solvay-omacor.com">
www.solvay-omacor.com</a>, the first question a user
sees is, “Are you a U.S. citizen?”
<p>If the answer is yes, the user is sent to a page
where heart attacks are not mentioned. (In the United
States, Omacor is licensed only to treat the small
number of people with extremely high blood triglyceride
levels.)
<p>So community doctors do not learn how to use the
drug. Lack of F.D.A. approval also means that insurers
will not pay for treatment with Omacor. Approval from
the agency for the use of the drug in heart disease is
not expected soon.
<p>A study published last month in The Journal of the
American Board of Family Medicine found that only 17
percent of family doctors were likely to prescribe fish
oil to their patients, including patients who had
suffered a heart attack. There was a great need, the
authors concluded, to “improve awareness of this
important advice.”
<p>The fact that fish oil is also sold as a nutritional
supplement has made it harder for some doctors to regard
it as a powerful drug, experts said.
<p>“Using this medicine is very popular here in Italy, I
think partly because so many cardiologists in this
country participated in the studies and were aware of
the results,” said Dr. Maria Franzosi, a researcher at
the Mario Negri Institute in Milan. “In other countries,
uptake may be harder because doctors think of it as just
a dietary intervention.”
<p>In the largest study of fish oil — conducted more
than a decade ago — Italian researchers from the Gissi
Group (Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza
nell’Infarto), gave 11,000 patients one gram of
prescription fish oil a day after heart attacks. After
three years, the study found that the number of deaths
was reduced by 20 percent and that the number of sudden
deaths by 40 percent, compared with a control group.
<p>Later studies have continued to yield positive
results, although some scientists say there are still
gaps in knowledge.
<p>This summer, a critical review of existing research
in BMJ, The British Medical Journal, “cast doubt over
the size of the effect of these medications” for the
general population, said Dr. Roger Harrison, an author
of the paper, “but still suggested that they might
benefit some people as a treatment.”
<p>Dr. Harrison said he believed that people should
generally increase their intake of omega-3 acids, best
done by eating more fish.
<p>Still, he acknowledged that it was difficult to eat
foods containing a gram of omega-3 acids each day. “If
you ask me do I take omega-3 supplements every day,
then, embarrassingly, the answer is yes,” said Dr.
Harrison, a professor at Bolton Primary Care Trust of
the University of Manchester in England.
<p>“I, too, am caught up in this hectic world where I
have little time to shop and prepare the healthy foods I
know I should be eating,” he said.</div>

It seems natural for Italy to be at the forefront of the
fish oil trend and home to the largest clinical trials.
Scientists have long noted that Mediterranean diets are
salubrious for the heart and theorized that the high
content of broiled and baked fish might be partly
responsible.<p>But the landmark Gissi-Prevenzione trial
of fish oil had methodological weaknesses: the patients
treated with prescription fish oil pills were compared
with untreated patients, rather than with patients given
a dummy pill. This meant that, despite impressive
results, the trial did not meet the F.D.A.’s standards
for approval. Yet by 2004, regulators in almost all
European countries, including Spain, France and Britain,
had approved Omacor for use in heart attack patients.
<p>Marylou Rowe, a spokeswoman for Reliant
Pharmaceuticals, which owns the license for the drug in
the United States, said that further trials of Omacor
would be needed for it to be licensed for heart attack
patients in the United States. But she refused to
discuss a timetable.
<p>The American College of Cardiology now advises
patients with coronary artery disease to increase their
consumption of omega-3 acids to one gram a day, but it
does not specify if this should be achieved by eating
fish or by taking capsules. But over-the-counter
preparations of fish oil have much less rigorous quality
control and are often blends of the two fish oils known
to be beneficial in heart disease with other less useful
fatty acids.
<p>For that reason, Dr. Jacobson of Emory gives the
prescription drug, “off label,” to cardiac patients,
even though the F.D.A. has not approved it for that use.
“Then I know exactly what they’re getting, and there is
no mercury,” he said.
<p>He said he tells patients who cannot afford the
prescription version that they can take the
over-the-counter supplements, although there is
uncertainty about the dose and they probably need three
to four pills a day.
<p>In Europe, meanwhile, research on prescription fish
oil, which is now thought to act by stabilizing cell
membranes, has gained momentum. The Gissi Group is
conducting two huge trials using fish oil in patients
with abnormal heart rhythms and in patients with heart
failure.</div>
