"Moral" is a matter of making a choice considering what is 'good' and what is not 'good'. "Ethics", or ethos, is a structure of morals or moral decisions. 

I say that morality and God are mutually exclusive. God's rules are not moral, they are commands sans reasons behind them.  Blindly and mindlessly following an order, when the punishment if one does not follow the command is eternal damnation in a pit of lava, is not morality.
